Welcome to the guide that hopefully helps establish good hygiene habits. Many people learn things like this as they grow up: by trying them out, seeing their siblings do it, friends telling them, or the not-so-friendly conversation about your hygiene. 

But not everyone. And certainly not everything there is to know.

Proper personal hygiene should not take you more than 15&ndash;30 minutes a day. This guide may seem a tad long, but that's because it also explains *why* something is good or bad.

I am a man, though. Which means that some sections are specifically for men, and their female equivalents are missing. I hope someone can fill in the gaps for me someday soon.
