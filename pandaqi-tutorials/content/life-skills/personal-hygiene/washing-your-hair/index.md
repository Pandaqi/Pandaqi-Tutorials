Your face is the most important aspect of your appearance. We've already covered washing it and keeping your teeth / mouth clean. Which leaves one important aspect: hair. Hair just keeps on growing, for some people more than for others.

My family, somehow, has genes for fast-growing hair. Even the eldest members of my family were never bald, not even close. While others only need to visit the hairdresser whenever they feel like it, my hair becomes extremely long after just a few weeks.

In general, though:

* Men need to visit a hairdresser every 6-8 weeks.
* Women need to visit a hairdresser every 3&dash;6 months.

In the meantime, don't stop caring for your hair. It automatically becomes greasy and starts sticking to your head. This usually doesn't look great, but also has other downsides. Most notably, the skin of your scalp gets more irritated or even wounded.

## How to wash your hair

This is the simple part. It's usually done while showering.

* Moisturize your hair. (Keep it under the water until all parts are wet.)
* Rub shampoo into it for a minute. 
* Let it sink in for another minute. 
* Then wash it out until all of it is gone.

## How often?

Most people aim for once every 2&ndash;3 days. 

I must admit I am a bit nonchalant in this department, and I excuse that by saying my hair looks _worse_ right after I wash it. So I plan washing my hair on days when I don't need to look presentable the next day :p 

## Best Practices

Don't use too much shampoo. Make sure you wash out all of it. If you leave some behind, it will most likely make your hair stick _even more_ than if you hadn't washed it all!

When drying your hair, don't be too violent.

* First shake your head to remove most of the water. 
* _Gently_ move your towel in the same direction as your hairs. Just carelessly rubbing the towel around every spot can damage your hair.
* **Don't** use a hairdryer. It kills hairs, it makes a lot of noise, it eats electricity. Again, trust the natural process of allowing your hair to dry.

If you have a habit of pushing your hands through your hair, or pulling strands, try to unlearn it. Many do this subconsciously, when they are stressed, or very focused on some task (like studying or reading).

If that's not possible, you'll need to wash it more. (The same is obviously true if you use hair products.)

## Washing your other hair

Obviously, your body has more hair than just your head. They also need attention. Fortunately, you can just clean them while washing the hair on your head.

Save some shampoo. Rub it over your body. (Or wherever your other hair is located.) Then wash it away.
