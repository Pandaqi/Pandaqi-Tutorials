We've discussed all the fundamental parts of achieving good personal hygiene! But there's always more.

These tips didn't fit elsewhere and are more related to general fitness and health. Check out the [Fitness & Health](../../fitness-health/) course for more on that. But I wanted to at least mention them here.

-   Get enough **sleep**. Sleeping is good for *everything*. It removes those awful bags under your eyes. It makes you look more fit and full of energy. It makes your skin smoother and healthier.
-   Eat **healthy.** Another obvious one: eating too many unhealthy foods is bad for your teeth, your weight, but also for your overall hygiene. We all know some foods that case farting or digestion issues ...
-   Create a **clean environment.** Change your sheets at least once a week, keep your working space clean and tidy. If you have just showered, and then immediately sit on a dirty chair again, it was all for naught.
-   Some **cologne**. For the men, spraying some cologne on your boxer makes that part a bit nicer, just like deodorants do for your armpits.

What about **skin care**? Honestly, if you life healthy and wash, you are done with skin care. This is why I keep hammering on about _natural and active lifestyle_. Our skin can do just fine on its own. If you need loads of skin care products, you are probably doing something wrong in your lifestyle that hurts your skin. 

> Always try to solve the problem, instead of the symptoms.

Bad personal hygiene is almost always a **symptom**. Can't find the motivation to clean yourself? Most likely an issue with mental health or schedule. The fact your hygiene becomes worse is merely a _symptom_. Need many products to look awake and attractive? Most likely an issue with your lifestyle. Get more sleep, eat better, exercise.

I know I can't speak for everyone. But I have always known the above to be true. Both myself and anyone around me that exercised a lot and did their best to improve their lifestyle, had no skin care routine at all, and their skin looked _great_.

I hope this guide was a nice overview of personal hygiene. It's certainly not in-depth and you can always learn more, but it's a start. (Because this stuff isn't really taught or discussed anywhere.)

Until the next course,
