This is the first section in my course on a healthy lifestyle. It is the first component of the trifecta of health: food, exercise and sleep.

It quickly discusses some well-known concepts (don't eat too many calories, fruit and vegetables are important, etcetera). But it mostly introduces lesser-known ideas. 

Over 15+ years of being chronically ill, I visited many doctors, which taught me a lot of detailed information about eating habits and effects.

Hopefully this "course" helps improve your health, and thus your life!
