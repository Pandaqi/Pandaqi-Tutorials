There's this saying: "if there was a pill that could give you the same benefits as exercising, everybody in the world would take it"

But there isn't such a pill. Exercising has too many advantages to name. More energy, more creativity, more motivation, better memory, better visual appearance, better sleep quality, happier, and so forth.

This course starts with the **trifecta of health**. 

* [Eating healthy](eating-healthy/)
* [Exercising well](fitness-and-exercise/)
* [Getting good quality sleep](sleeping-hygiene/)

But health is so broad and important, that each part received its own (sub)course. Once you've read through the trifecta, expand your knowledge with the others. 

I recommend reading the [Productivity](../productivity/) course as well. Finding motivation and discipline is half the battle for _anything_ you want to accomplish.

**Who are you?** I've been chronically ill for almost my whole life. This means I've visited more hospitals, doctors, nurses, etcetera than most people will ever see. I picked up whole books worth of knowledge about health, which I amended with my own research and experiments.

Because, when your health fails and you are in pain all day, you'd try anything to resolve it.

**Health doesn't negotiate.** Maintaining a good health is more important than _anything_. Once you drop the ball, it's gone, and you often can't fully get it back. 

I hope the information in these courses save your life. I really think it's that important.
