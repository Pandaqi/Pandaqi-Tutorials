This is the third section in my course on a healthy lifestyle. It is the third component of the trifecta of health: food, exercise and sleep.

**Sleep hygiene** is simply about good habits that help get a _better_ quality of sleep.

Why is this important? How much sleep should you get? How can you use the advantages of sleep? How do you know you've slept well?

Hopefully, all of your questions will be answered in this (very short) course.
