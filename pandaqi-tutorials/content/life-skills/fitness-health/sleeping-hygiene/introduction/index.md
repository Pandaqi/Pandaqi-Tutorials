Sleep is just as important for your health as eating or exercising well. But people often forget this, or feel like they can't "control" sleep. I can empathize, as I thought the same thing for a long time.

I thought I was simply someone who had to lie in bed for 1&ndash;2 hours before falling asleep. I thought I was simply someone that needed more light to sleep.

Then I went to medical rehabilitation. (For my chronic illness, not the minor sleeping troubles ðŸ˜‰) And I was taught all about **sleep hygiene**

Nowadays I sleep within 15 minutes, or 30 minutes at most. I get good quality sleep and actually feel fresh when I wake up.

In this (short) guide, I want to teach _you_ how to do the same thing.

I start with crucial information and tips. At the end, I give some more science and detail, but that is completely optional.

This course is part of a bigger series on [Health](../../../fitness-health/). I recommend reading the rest as well, including the course on productivity, habits and discipline. Because tips are only great if you actually manage to _do_ them.
