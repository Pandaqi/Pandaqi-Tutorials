This is the second section in my course on a healthy lifestyle. It is the second component of the trifecta of health: food, exercise and sleep.

We all know exercise is important. But how important? And why? How often should you exercise?

For example, there are certainly _wrong_ ways to exercise, which can (over time) have very negative results o your health. At the same time, there are many misconceptions about exercise that just won't go away.

Hopefully this "course" helps take control of your fitness and exercise schedule.
