A course about _accomplishing stuff_, in the broadest sense of the word. About getting work done and finishing projects---but also general discipline, motivation and habits.

For me, productivity is most important as a tool to stay _healthy_. (As I have a severe chronic illness.) That's how this guide is structured: how to do the right things, even if you feel unmotivated or don't want to do it.

The fact that this leads to _getting (professional) work done_ is a nice side effect. 

And yes, I know you don't have much time, so I write as simple and to-the-point as possible.

You can see these techniques in action by visiting my [portfolio](https://rodepanda.com). That's quite a lot of finished projects for such a short time, isn't it? ðŸ˜‰
