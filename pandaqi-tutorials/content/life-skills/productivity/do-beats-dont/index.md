Doubt. Doubt is the killer of all human dreams. It's certainly the killer of many things in my life, both in terms of productivity and life choices.

We have this miraculous ability---to doubt---because we can see futures and reason about them. A dog, for example, sees something and has an instant reaction. Food? Eat. Toy? Play. Tired? Sleep.

We think much further ahead. We try to predict consequences. We try to _design_ where we want to be in a year from now.

I still constantly have doubts about what I'm doing. As an artist, I always have more ideas than time. I have great ideas for books ... but also for games, and for websites, and so forth. Which one do I choose? Doubt like that easily kills any motivation or momentum, because even if you _are_ productive, you are questioning if you are doing _the right thing_.

As I mentioned last chapter, though, we cannot predict the future. At least, not the far future. 

When doubt appears about something that is relevant _now_, then yes, doubt is relevant. Don't ignore it. You have a choice _now_ and need to figure out the right one.

When doubt appears about something further ahead, ignore it. It's nothing more than wasting time. You can't predict the future any better by _waiting_.

You know what _does_ help make decisions? **Getting more information.** And you can only get more information by _doing_ something.

> When in doubt, pick anything and do it. Then reflect later if it was the right thing. If so, continue. Otherwise, do something _else_.

## Prototyping

I usually prototype my projects for this reason. 

When you get a new idea, it always _feels_ exciting. This is what you should be working on! Not that other project you're currently doing! Go do the new thing!

But the process from idea to execution is long and dangerous. By simply _trying_ the new idea for a day or two, you get much more information. Is it actually good? Is it more difficult than I thought? Is it worth it?

> Action destroys doubt.

Even if your prototype ends up shit and you are disappointed your idea doesn't work, **now you know**. You don't have to have doubts about it. You aren't distracted by it. You know your current project is indeed the best choice, so you continue.

## Certain tasks vs Creative tasks

I learned to divide tasks into two categories:

* **Certain tasks**: you're certain you have to do this. There's no creativity, no guesswork, nothing yet to be determined. It just has to be done.
* **Creative tasks**: you have to figure something out, find a solution for a problem, you're not sure _how_ to do the task.

The second type is much more exciting. When I make a game, I do so because I love inventing new systems, drawing cool icons, getting my idea working. I love the _creative_ work.

That's why I do first. Or, that's what I _try_ to do first.

But inspiration doesn't always come. The well of creativity runs dry, especially after a few hours.

It's useless to keep banging your head against that wall.

What to do? 

> When your creative tasks come to a halt, switch to certain tasks.

Recognize when you don't have the energy or inspiration anymore. Recognize when that mountain is too high to climb. If so, ignore all your creative tasks, and switch to the easy and certain ones.

I often write devlogs for my projects, especially the games. Why? It's a certain task. I can _always_ write a bit to explain what I've already done. To copy-paste some code I already wrote. There's almost no creativity or uncertainty there.

So when I can't figure out a problem for my game ... I write the devlog, maybe write about this problem as well and possible solutions. It's still productive and keeps the momentum up.

## The take-away

Any time a human wants to do something, thoughts like "shouldn't I do that other thing?" or "why would I even do this, why go through the effort" pop up.

Don't completely _ignore_ them. That's what our harsh "discipline" would do: ignore doubt, ignore feelings, just _force_ yourself through something.

Also don't _give in_ to them. As explained, it yields _nothing_. 

Instead,

* Either pick any of the options and _do it_. Get more information, so you can stop doubting.
* Or switch to _certain tasks_ that won't lead to doubt.

At the start of the course, I shared my portfolio. I mentioned how full it was, despite only being active as a freelance artist for a few years. I was very productive. I finished many projects.

I don't have genes that prevent me from doubting. I don't think all my decisions were the best ones. In fact, many of the earlier projects are full of mistakes, missed opportunities, and so forth.

But I made them. I did _something_, which allowed me to finish projects, and make _better_ choices in the future. It's all that counts. In fact, I often received responses that showed _others_ did not see the mistakes that I clearly see and have doubts about.
