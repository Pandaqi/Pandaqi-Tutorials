At the start of this guide, I talked about motivation not being consistent, and people naturally struggling with it. People are _social_ beings. It's hard for us to do things on our own, for ourselves, in isolation.

Instead, many articles on productivity will advice you to _announce_ your goals or projects, so other people hold you accountable. They will advice you to seek validation and support outside of your own head.

This is partially useful, and partially a big trap.

Yes, other people can help you to keep going. They can give objective feedback, when you see everything through a colored subjective lens. (If you think you're fat, you're going to look in the mirror and find every reason to confirm you're fat. Others might simply look at you and think you're not fat.)

Yes, people are motivated and happier when they have strong social relationships. People do really well on _responsibility_. If they're afraid to let someone else down, they will not complain and do the work.

At the same time ... most other people don't give a shit.

Harsh words, I know. But you're not the center of the universe. If you announce your goals, others will likely say "sure, great," and continue with their lives. Don't expect _them_ to carry _you_. Don't expect them to be as involved with your project as you are. Most of the time, nobody is even waiting on that project you're making, nobody even cares if you are healthy or not.

That's simply the reality.

And seeking validation then, trying to build your motivation on the shoulders of _others_, will merely lead to more disappointment and sadness.

Clearly, there's a balance here. It took me a long time to find that balance. And it might be different for everyone, it might depend on what productivity means to you.

So I'll just share my own journey and what I've learned.

## You don't have to believe in yourself

It has become a sort of motto for artists worldwide: "my greatest enemy is crippling self-doubt"

Many people recognize themselves in that statement. You constantly feel the imposter syndrome. You look at your own work, compare it to the finished product of professionals, and think you're incompotent and shouldn't even try anymore.

This _does not go away_. No moving speech, no self-help book, no amount of succes will make this go away. Anyone with ambition will always strive for more and look to bigger futures. Don't expect that everything will fall into place once you've removed the self-doubt, once you "believe in yourself".

Instead, you just have to _ignore this_. I don't know who said it, but I once read: "You don't have to believe in yourself. You just need to put in the work."

Take belief out of the equation. Don't expect you to believe in yourself. Don't expect a community to magically form around you and believe in you. Belief is not important.

Just put in the work. 

Put in the work, and the community _will come_. Once you've done some things, others will find it and be impressed. They will see what you cannot see. They will show you how far you've come, how productive you've been.

Again, you almost can _not_ see this yourself. You _need_ outsiders to reveal or confirm this for you.

But that can only happen if you've _done the thing you wanted to do_ for a long enough time.

## Publish fast, publish early

So yes, community is crucial. They give feedback. They support you when you can't support yourself. They see things you cannot see anymore.

But again, the community cannot come if you don't _put stuff out there_. Let others know your goals. Let others know what you're trying to do. But also actually _do_ it. Also share the final product, something that comes close to the goal, as early as possible.

This is a common mistake with game developers. They work on their game in isolation, almost in secret, for _years_. And then they either lose motivation and quit, or they release it thinking it's ready ... and it's not ready at all.

If developers share their progress, it's usually in vague terms. They show some progress. They state a few development plans for the next month. This is _not enough_.

Build something. As soon as it _somewhat works_, start sharing it with people, start talking about it. Publish fast and early. 

I give a lot of examples that show productivity through projects and creative products. But the same is true for other goals, like improving your health, or gaining other (soft) skills.

There's no need to work on that in secret.

I've had trouble using my voice and speaking clearly for years, due to my chronic illness. I made the mistake of hiding this, which is doubly stupid, as people can _hear_ you having trouble!

Instead, let people know. Say you are working on it. Ask them to give feedback, when they can't understand you, or something else is wrong. As people learn what you're doing, they will also automatically point out _progress_ or _good things_. They might _ask_ how it's going. 

Those tiny moments of community and social validation are _amazing_ for getting things done and keeping the momentum.

## Fail big, fail publicly

This is related to the first point. Naturally, people are cautious when sharing, cautious when making statements.

While I don't advocate pretending you're amazing, or lying to yourself and others, it _is_ recommended to "fail big".

Why? The bigger the fail, the more you learn. But also, the bigger the risk, the more incentive you have to not screw it up or abandon the goal.

It's easy to give up a creative project if all you've invested is _time_. It's less easy if you've invested a large sum of money. Or you've clearly stated a deadline, on which your project is released, for a year now. Or you've entered contracts with publishers, other parties, whatever.

Again, the reason community beats ago, is because humans work well with **responsibility**. The more responsibility you put on your shoulders, the more you will **live up** to the task. Quitting or falling back into bad habits isn't even an option anymore. Not shipping that product isn't even an option anymore.

This is one I still struggle with. I am still cautious when creating new projects. I keep them small. I don't build expectations, I invest nothing, I isolate myself to put in more hours of work. All good ideas ... but they also make it hard to actually reach my goals, instead of giving up halfway or building something that was "easier" to make.

Don't _expect_ or _require_ community. In the end, it's a battle between _you_ and the _task you want to accomplish_. The primary action and discipline will have to come from _you_. But put in the work, share all you do and think, and _accept_ any community that comes your way.

This is general life advice, actually. **Invite** responsibility into your life. Enter projects or agreements which are a bit out of your comfort zone. Enter relationships, even when unsure if you can maintain them. 

More often than not, people will rise to the occasion. 

And that's why community beats ego.
