Humans are just animals with slightly better cognitive capabilities. This is important to remember, as it determines everything about how we think and work.

Why do we struggle with discipline? Why are we often unmotivated to do something, even if we know it's _good_ to do, or we _like_ doing it?

Because we're animals regulated by hormones, feelings, and conservation of energy. If possible, animals will always be lazy. Why do more work than necessary? Why potentially waste energy? Why do anything at all, when you feel sad?

So, how do we become more productive? How do we find that discipline?

By using a lot of **tricks** to apply the weird psychology of humans for good. You will never change our nature. You will never truly feel motivated for _everything_ and have energy for _everything_.

Instead, you can design your workflow and lifestyle to _trick_ yourself into accomplishing stuff. To use laziness to your advantage. To prefer consistency over tiny moments of inspiration.

I am serious about this. I have made _tons_ of games, websites, books, albums, etcetera. Not once did I feel motivated and happy all the way through. In fact, I often only had natural motivation for, like, the first three days of the project. Ask anybody else who gets things done, and they'll tell you that motivation is a myth. It's about _process_ and _habits_.

This guide talks about the techniques, from easiest but least effective, to hardest but most effective.

At some points, I might sound a bit harsh or like I'm screaming from my iron tower. I'm not angry, don't worry, these are all just tips and ideas to help you. But it helps shorten the text and be more convincing. If I have to add nuance, softness and exceptions to everything ... this course would be an unreadable mess, 1000 pages long!
