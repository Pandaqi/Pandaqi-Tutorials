So far, I've basically told you to just do _something_. Do, and do, and do, and you will get a great _understanding_ of any skill.

But is there really no way to speed that up? Is every action really equal?

No, I have found one easy way to see if something is worth doing. It's connected to that idea of _understanding_ or _intuition_, as opposed to just learning facts.

It's all in the title.

> Prefer _deep learning_ (towards a generally applicable understanding) over _superficial learning_ (of facts and theory with only limited uses)

Both are useful. They _are_ both called "learning" and provide information. The point of this article is that deep learning should be your focus and your priority 90% of the time.

## Example: learning new software

This is an issue with any digital creative field and often joked about. Every time you get stuck, you switch to a _new program_ in the hope that it will magically fix your workflow. It's like swapping an old, tiny guitar for an expensive one and hoping you suddenly know all the chords.

It doesn't work that way. Yes, some software will help you more than others, better equipment will give some advantage. But it's only a tiny advantage, and you can't keep buying or switching forever.

When you do this, you spend all your time learning _superficial things_. Like,

* What each button does in the interface
* Where to look in the menus or preferences for a certain Photoshop effect
* Some odd quirks with the system you use
* Or ways in which this specific software likes to do things

Yes, you've learned a lot through using that software. But most of it is superficial and only applicable to _that specific software_.

If you were to switch, by preference or by external pressure, you'd lose 90% of your skill. You'd have to start over.

Instead, focus your learning on _deep knowledge_. 

Don't follow tutorials like "How to do X in software Y". Don't follow courses that spend time detailing _everything_ in the interface, 99% of which you don't need yet.

Do follow tutorials about general practices, which _happen_ to be in some software. Do pick projects based on practicing general principles, something you could apply anywhere.

Deep knowledge is endlessly valuable. Superficial knowledge can stop being valuable any day.

This also often applied to languages or programming languages. Learn one really well. Then all the others will come naturally, as they are 95% the same. Good programming principles in one language will be the same in any other, even if their syntax differs wildly. 

That's why, when I try to get somebody into programming, I don't involve actual coding until the end. First learn how to problem solve and how a computer thinks. Once you know that, the specific words you type---in some specific language---are just a byproduct.

## The Cook vs The Chef

Let's go back to that fantasy writer I mentioned earlier: Brandon Sanderson. The one that writes _tons_ of books each year, only getting better.

He explained this difference as the _cook_ versus the _chef_.

The cook _knows_ how their kitchen is laid out. They know where tools. They know how to _follow a recipe_ to create something in their kitchen.

The chef _understands_ deeply how food and recipes work. They know when they can deviate from a recipe, or use a different tool and change the end product in a positive way. They don't merely know facts or buttons to press, they have a deep _understanding_.

That's superficial knowledge versus deep knowledge. I think it's an easy and memorable way to understand it.

He continues by explaining why _quantity_ and _doing_ gets you to the deep knowledge. If you sit in class and listen to someone spewing writing advice, you're a cook. You might work hard and _remember_ all that advice, but you'll struggle actually writing your own book and making it good. Instead, write ten books yourself, and you'll understand deeply where that advices comes from. You can break the rules when that's by far the best choice.

And as always, the chef can't explain what they do. The knowledge is so deep, it can barely bubble to the surface :p

If you ask them why they threw certain ingredients together and it tastes delicious, they'll shrug and say: "just felt like the right choice"

## More examples for clarity

Deep knowledge often feels like "one step ahead" or "counter intuitive". Superficial knowledge sounds very logical and "duh" on its own, but falls apart under any scrutiny.

I've done some statistical simulations of board games. In those, the computer players try random strategies from a large list I programmed. Often, the winning strategies do _not_ seem logical on the surface. When I added them, it was usually for completeness' sake, or as a "control strategy". They seem stupid if you only think one turn ahead. But letting the computer play millions of games, they prove that the strategy is smart in the long-term. That's deep knowledge.

Deep knowledge transfers between software, courses, projects, objectives. Superficial knowledge does not.

By practicing graphic design, I learned about visual hierarchy and grouping elements by putting them close together. (And clearly showing that elements are not similar by placing them far apart.) This helped me a lot in all other areas of work. It is deep knowledge that _transfers_.

When I program, for example, I focus on readability. I about code that is well structured, has a hierarchy, and is easy to visually parse. More so than code that is as fast or succinct as possible. That shift has made my programming work much faster and less ... annoying.

Deep knowledge is usually about relationships or connections. General principles to take into consideration at all times. Superficial knowledge can usually be framed as a specific "how to X?"-question.

Let's take gardening as an example. The combination of plants in a (kitchen) garden matters. Some will get in each other's way, others will benefit from each other. Finding good plant combinations takes deeper understanding. You need to understand many underlying principles of how plants grow, what resources they need, and how they interact. You can't easily frame this as one specific question.

On the other hand, you can say "how to water a cucumber plant in my kitchen garden?" Yes, that is something useful! Especially if you have many cucumber plants! But I'd classify that as superficial knowledge.

As expected, deep knowledge comes from applying the principles in this guide. This article is more about _awareness_. Now you're more aware if an action is leading to deep or superficial knowledge. If what you're doing is generally beneficial or only about learning one specific thing in a specific circumstance. Once you notice it, switch to deeper learning.
