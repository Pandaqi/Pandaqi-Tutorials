We can be short about this. There is no evidence that personal learning styles exist. There is, however, evidence that it helps to present information in **all possible ways**.

To understand what I mean with that, we first need to define _passive_ and _active_ learning. These are trivial definitions, don't worry. But they help analyze a situation and how effective it will be for learning.

## Passive vs Active

Learning is **passive** if you're not actively doing something to receive the information. Learning is **active** when you are.

Examples of passive learning are ...

* Lectures
* Podcasts
* Watching a video

Examples of active learning are ...

* Reading (though not the best)
* Writing
* Giving your own presentation or lecture
* Doing exercises
* Playing games

As expected, you want to be on the _active_ side as much as possible. Why do you think I wrote all these tutorials? Yes, I want to share knowledge and help people. But writing these articles was usually just my way of learning something new.

It's one of the great paradoxes. To learn something well, you need to teach it to others. But those others won't learn much from it---as it's passive for them.

Now you see some of the reasons why school is so ineffective. It's focused on lectures. In recent years, the only "change" to the system is that they started modernizing. What did they do? Give all kids a tablet! More screens! Explain everything with video! It's sad to see, as it just makes the learning even more passive.

It's not "terrible" to do some passive learning. It takes less energy, there's more of it (especially if you're in school), it gives people the false sense that they're doing great. Don't be too harsh on yourself, but the majority of learning should come through active methods.

In the ideal world, we'd have lots of great games around any topic :) But until then, passive learning is sometimes the only way.

A professor at my university once started a course by explaining why the university sucked for learning---for two hours. She was great. She explained that lectures or watching videos were too passive and would do you no good. 

The homework for that course was _tough_. Many difficult exercises, for months on end. But she didn't care if you came to class or whatever, and she didn't allow you to be on your laptop or phone if you _were_ there. Not even for note-taking. In the end, it was one of my favorite courses and I actually remember lots of it.

## How to communicate information?

When people have a personal "learning style", they often mention a specific _way_ of information transfer. Like,

* Speaking
* Text
* Pictures
* Video/Animation
* Sound

Humans have _many_ ways to convey information. The _most suitable_ method depends on the information. Teaching someone how to write through sound is unwise. If you want to teach what a molecular structure looks like, use a picture, not some wall of text describing it.

That's the first step: **don't stick to one style for everything, pick the best thing for the topic**.

But, if possible, take the second step: **supply information in all possible ways**.

This accelerates learning. You associate the same information in many different ways. You automatically _repeat_ the information, creating a stronger memory of it. One method might click for you this time, another might not.

This also works the other way around. If you're a graphic designer, chances are you have more neurons in your brain about _visual stuff_. So, seeing a picture of something will generally help you understand it faster. But if there's text besides the picture as well, you also improve your understanding of information through _text_. Because now you've seen the same thing in both ways and can connect them.

What's the lesson? Don't stick to one technique or information channel. Try to include them all and pick the best one for the job.

My entire life, I was told to stop trying new things all the time and just stick with _one thing_. Yes, it can be exhausting or demotivating. I work in four completely different fields and always feel like I don't know enough. At the same time, this probably helps me learn things much faster. I can consume _or_ teach any subject in a variety of ways! I know how to design images, I have a piano and recording tools for sound, I can write, etcetera.

That's why many courses on this website have pictures, quizzes or animations. But only where appropriate. I hate articles that place random stock photos throughout the text to break it up. Just distracting and pointless. Similarly, because videos are passive learning (yet take a lot of work to make), I hesitate to make one unless I'm sure it is needed.
