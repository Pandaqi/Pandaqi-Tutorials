This guide is about how humans _learn_. About how you can use simple tips and ideas to learn anything, both at a higher quantity and a higher quality.

This is **not** one of those guides about "how I study for 12 hours a day" or about the "grind". No, I think that's very unhealthy. Most of all, it's not needed.

I've studied how the human brain learns pretty much my entire life and found many ways to do a lot with little effort. What is most effective and what is least effective. Hopefully you agree with me after reading this guide!
