Welcome to my tutorial website! Pick a course and start reading.

It is my firm belief that knowledge and education should be free to all. You **don't** need to pay for a book, course, college, service, or whatever. You **don't** need to wait on the terrible educational system to improve yourself. 

Most knowledge is available online, for free. Learning happens mostly by _doing_ and _experimenting_, which you can obviously do yourself, for free, any time.

I maintain this website to help this cause. It has many high-quality, playful courses from the areas in which I work. If I donâ€™t have what you're looking for, check out the [other resources](/tutorials/general-knowledge/pandaqi-tutorials/other-resources).
