Alright, you can now define data (bool, number, string) and do some calculations. But once you have your result, you want to _store_ it somewhere. You want to put your data on a shelf with a clear label that says what's inside. Otherwise, you'd have to redo the whole calculation every time!

This is called a **variable**.

## Data flies away

To give an analogy, imagine your data as a butterfly. If you don't catch it, it will fly away and disappear. The computer didn't know you wanted to keep that! It's dumb---you need to _tell_ it.

So you trap the butterfly inside a box, a jar, something. And you put a label on it saying "Butterfly".

That's what a variable is. A label for some data you collected, so you don't forget.

![Visualization of the idea of saving information inside jars with labels = variables.](variable_jar_analogy.webp)

Why "variable"? Why not "data container"? Firstly, because that sounds horrible ðŸ˜‰; Secondly, because you can also _change_ it as you go. The data can _vary_. Pretty useful, seeing that coding is just changing data. 

In my analogy, this is like opening the box and swapping the butterfly with another insect. Like a spider. You can still find the jar if you search for the label "Butterfly", but the data inside changed.

This analogy, hopefully, also shows the dangers. A jar labeled "Butterfly" is pretty confusing once it contains a spider. Useless, one might say.

As such, it's vital to

* Invent a _good_ name that fits
* Never change the nature of what's inside (so the name becomes incorrect)
* Prevent overwriting a value you wanted to keep with a new value

## Syntax

From now on, most chapters will introduce some "syntax". Syntax simply means: "what word must I type to achieve this?"

These will appear inside blue boxes. They explain how to do this thing in _my_ example language. It will often be very close to how others do it, albeit simpler and more readable.

### Define

You already know this syntax. In all the examples so far, I've used it!

> Define a variable with `now NAME means VALUE`

To change it, simply put a new value inside. Yes, you can use the old value for those calculations. In fact, that's what you do most of the time.

{{< bamboo >}}
now myNum means 10
now myNum means myNum + 10
myNum + 10
say myNum
{{< /bamboo >}}

Notice how the output is 20, not 30. That third line (`myNum + 10`) calculates it, but never stores it! The butterfly was spotted ... then flew away.

### Change

Changing a variable and _saving it back in itself_ is so common that most languages have a "shorthand". A quicker way to do it.

> Change a variable (numerically) with `change NAME by VALUE`

{{% data-trans from="Value" to="Changed Value" %}}

{{< bamboo >}}
now myNum means 0
change myNum by 10
change myNum by -5
say myNum
{{< /bamboo >}}

I only provide one. That's all you need for this course. 

But if you ever see something like `+=` or `*=` in other languages, it's a shorthand for this. Something like `var += 2` is identical to `var = var + 2`.

This is one of the major stumbling blocks for newbie coders. This idea that you need to _store_ everything you do. And this weird notation with multiple symbols after each other. That's why, for my introductory language, I try to ignore symbols and write everything in simple sentences.

Just remember the butterfly analogy---and everything will be alright.
