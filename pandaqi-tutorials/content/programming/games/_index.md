Tutorials about making _games_. Which frameworks to use, general principles for good design, how to code your way around hard problems.

What do I recommend?
- Phaser for 2D web/mobile games
- Godot Engine for anything else
- A statically typed language
- Making lots of small games, quickly, to gain experience.
