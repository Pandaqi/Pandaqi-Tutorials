Three.js is a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics, right in your browser. 

It's a JavaScript library. This means you include it as a script and use JavaScript to interact with it.

Where Phaser is the ideal framework for 2D games/apps, Three.js is often seen as the right candidate for the 3D games/apps.
