SQL is the language used for interacting with databases. It stands for <em>Structured Query Language</em>. With it, you can ask your database questions (like "get me the latest blog post") or tell it new stuff ("here, save this new blog post").

Most websites are powered by a database of some form. PHP and SQL has been the combo for the past decades. But know that there are alternatives, for example NoSQL databases and static websites.
