While CSS is a great language, it's very basic. It lacks some useful and common functionality found in other (programming) languages. For example, you cannot _nest_ selectors, or reuse _variables_.

To solve this problem, SASS was invented. It's a pre-processor: after typing your code, it will _process_ it, and _convert_ it to a regular CSS file.

I cannot recommend using a CSS pre-processor enough. It's a simple layer on top of CSS, easy to learn, and has only advantages.
