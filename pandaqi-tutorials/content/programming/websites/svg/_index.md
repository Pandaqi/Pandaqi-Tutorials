Scalable Vector Graphics has been a stable web technology for quite some time now ... yet are relatively unknown. 

They allow you to create infinitely scalable graphics right within your web browser. It uses the same concepts as HTML and CSS, and is therefore a small language you can learn in no time.

Creating them dynamically is of course flexible and powerful. But if you just want fixed vector graphics, e.g. for icons, I advice using software for this and exporting to .svg when done.
