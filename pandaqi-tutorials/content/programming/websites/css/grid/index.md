The introduction of the CSS grid module was a major milestone. It is _extremely_ powerful, versatile and useful. It gives finetuned control over the _size_ and _position_ of all elements within the grid.

Basic website layout, with a main article and a sidebar? Grid!

Dynamic layout with tiles and images on the front page? Grid!

Intuitive UI that allows you to drag and drop images or elements around? Grid!

That also means, however, that I can't explain all of it in just one chapter. This chapter merely gives you the high-level overview and simple, practical syntax for the most common use cases.

If you want, you can view the _grid_ as _two flexboxes at once_: both vertical and horizontal at the same time. That indicates both how powerful and how complex it is.

Turning a container into a grid is still as easy as before: use `display: grid;`.

All its direct children are now "grid items" and behave as such.

Now the fun starts.

@TODO: actually write article + interactive examples + images?
