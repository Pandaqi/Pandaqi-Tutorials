PHP is used by over 80% of all websites, and for a good reason. It's a fast and beginner-friendly way to let your server do awesome things for your website. WordPress was built in it, for example.

This does mean that you need a _server_. Fortunately, you can run one locally, right on your computer.

Create a blog, an MMORPG, an ecommerce website, or a user account system---the sky's the limit! Or, well, your server's capacity is the limit.
