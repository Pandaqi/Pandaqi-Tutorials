The original title for this guide was "how to actually become a better programmer". It explained exactly what the guide is about---but it was too long. 

In this guide, it doesn't matter which language you use, what software or for what purpose. I'll explain general principles to make programming more fun, efficient and bug-free. I've learned these principles by coding for 15 years in all sorts of situations and projects. 

As expected, there are code examples galore! And I highly recommend immediately trying each principle yourself to make sure it sticks.
