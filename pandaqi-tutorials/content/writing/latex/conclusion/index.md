Congratulations! You're a LaTeX wizard now âœ¨

You've seen and played with the fundamentals of LaTeX. Even some slightly advanced topics. You should be able to do nearly anything. I hope that, by explaining the fundamental concepts and the reason _why_ they exist at the start, your understanding of the language and its quirks has only _grown_.

And yet we have only scratched the surface! 

The main purpose of LaTeX is _scientific notation_, most importantly _mathematics_. I've left this out completely so it could become its own course: [Latex Math](/tutorials/writing/latex-math). Because, yes, merely notating formulas and symbols is a whole course on its own.

A second course is also in the making. It will focus less on semantics and structure, and more on layout and visuals. Colours, more graphics, more advanced packages, all sorts of options to modify the default look.

Keep learning,

Pandaqi
