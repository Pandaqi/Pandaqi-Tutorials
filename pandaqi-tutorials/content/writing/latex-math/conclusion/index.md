Hopefully you now have the tools to typeset any (complicated) mathematics, formulas, algorithms and theorems you want.

Of course, there is way more available. More settings, more detailed commands, more packages to include that do fun stuff. But you won't need them for 99% of the cases. LaTeX and math are already complicated enough, with many commands and operators to learn, so I wanted to keep the course to only the essentials.

That's it for _LaTeX Math_.

Keep learning,
