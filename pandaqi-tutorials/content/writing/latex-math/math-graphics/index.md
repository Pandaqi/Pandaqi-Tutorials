In the basic course we saw the command for including a picture file. It was `\includegraphics`. Which is slightly odd, isn't it? Why not just use the simpler `picture` or `graphics`?

Well, LaTeX does have a simple `picture` environment! But because the language was meant to typeset pieces with heavy use of math, this environment is reserved for *mathematical graphics*.

Within the `picture` environment, you can use a small list of commands to place different types of figures. When combined, they can generate complex mathematical graphics. 

> It's similar to vector graphics, in case you understand that. It isn't very _difficult_, it might just be a lot to take in at once. We'll start off simple.

## Starting the Picture Environment

It's a regular environment, except for the fact that the arguments are delimited differently: with parentheses for brackets. 

{{< highlight Latex >}}
\begin{picture}{width, height)(xOffset, yOffset)
    % ... picture commands ... 
\end{picture}
{{< /highlight >}}

These arguments are *not* regular LaTeX numbers with units! They refer to the amount of units within the picture. To length that holds this information is `\unitlength`, which you can change the way you're used to.

{{< highlight Latex >}}
\setlength{\unitlength}{4pt}
\begin{picture}(20,20)(0,0)
    %Picture with width and height of 80pt
    %But there's nothing in it, yes, let's change that!
\end{picture}
{{< /highlight >}}

The *xOffset* and *yOffset* set the coordinates of the **lower left** corner of the picture. In the example, the point *(0,0)* is used for the lower left corner, which means any negative coordinates would not be visible inside the picture.

This uses the _mathematical_ way of viewing axes. Right = X positive, Up = Y positive. 

If you're used to other computer graphics, maybe programming or game development, you might be profoundly confused by this. In all those other situations, Down = Y positive. Try to clearly make this distinction in your head. LaTeX is for typesetting _math_.

## Putting Graphics on the Page

To put graphics on the page, three very important commands are available.

Place *object* at position (x,y). (You'll learn about all the math objects soon.)

{{< highlight Latex >}}
\put(x, y){object}
{{< /highlight >}}

Place *n* objects, starting at position (x,y), with *deltaX* and
*deltaY* space between each object and the next.

{{< highlight Latex >}}
\multiput(x, y)(deltaX, deltaY){n}{object}
{{< /highlight >}}

Place a quadratic Bezier curve using the three data points you provide. Mostly used for drawing graphs. These curves are, sadly enough, beyond the scope of this tutorial.

{{< highlight Latex >}}
\qbezier(x1, y1) (x2, y2) (x3, y3)
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< double-view src="LatexMathPicturePutting" lang="Latex" >}}
\setlength{\unitlength}{4pt}
\begin{picture}(20,20)(0,0)
    \put(0,0){\line(1,0){5}}
    \multiput(4,3)(1,1){10}{\line(0,1){5}}
\end{picture}
{{< /double-view >}}

## Changing Thickness

By default, lines have medium thickness. You can change this at any time. These commands take effect until a next one is encountered.

| Command                    |  Description |
| ---------------------------|  ------------------------------ |
| `\thicklines`              | Slightly thicker lines |
| `\thinlines`               | Slightly thinner lines |
| `\linethickness{length}`   | Sets a custom line thickness |

## Math Objects

As promised, here's a list of all the math objects that can be placed within the picture:

| Command                             | Description |
|-|-|
| `\line(x, y){length}`              | Creates a line with length *length*, with direction vector (*x,y*). A direction vector can only take integers.
| `\vector(x, y){length}`            | Also creates a line, but with an arrow at the end. |
| `\circle{diameter}`                | Creates a circle |
| `\circle*{diameter}`               | Creates a filled circle (a *disk*). |
| `\oval(width, height)[position]`   | Creates an oval. The optional argument *position* can be top, right, bottom or left (`t`, | `r`, `b`, `l`), and determines what part to show. |
| `\frame{â€¦}`                       |  Creates a rectangular frame around the object that's inside, with no padding space. |
| *Text or math*                     | You can put any of the LaTeX you learned inside a picture---regular text and fancy math. This, however, only works for single lines. |

{{< double-view src="LatexMathPictureObjects" lang="Latex" >}}
\setlength{\unitlength}{4pt}
\begin{picture}(20,20)(0,0)
    \put(0,0){The formula is $x^2 + y^2 = 4$}
    \put(8,8){\circle{4}}
    \put(16,16){\oval(6,6)[t]}
    \put(12,12){\vector(1,0){10}}
\end{picture}
{{< /double-view >}}

## Save Boxes

If you want to reuse a certain (complex) graphic multiple times in your picture, you can save it in a *save box*. 

Now you only need to define it _once_, and use it anywhere else by referencing the name under which you saved it. This is a very powerful way of creating pictures, which greatly reduces the time it takes to create them.

To declare a new save box, use

{{< highlight Latex >}}
\newsavebox{name}
{{< /highlight >}}

To define it, i.e. tell exactly what's inside, use

{{< highlight Latex >}}
\savebox{name}(width, height)[position]{content}
{{< /highlight >}}

Put it in your picture wherever you want, and as many times as you like, using

{{< highlight Latex >}}
\usebox{name}
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< double-view src="LatexMathSaveBoxes" lang="Latex" >}}
\setlength{\unitlength}{4pt}
\begin{picture}(20,20)(0,0)
    \newsavebox{MYBOX}
    \savebox{MYBOX}(5,5)[l]{%
        \put(0,0){\circle*{4}}
        \put(1,0){\circle*{4}}
    }
    \put(10,10){\usebox{MYBOX}}
\end{picture}
