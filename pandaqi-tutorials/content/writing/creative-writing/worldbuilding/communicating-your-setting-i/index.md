This is the trick that writers need to learn, especially fantasy writers. How do you convey information about your world in a natural way? And in a way that is interesting and doesn't break the flow of the story?

I touched on this at the end of the previous chapter. It's all about _character_. Every scene in your story is told from the viewpoint of some character. They are the ones actually experiencing the world and living in it. 

So how do you convey information?

* Through the lens of character
* By _showing_ instead of telling
* By using tricks to put the information in dialogue

The rest of this chapter explores these three techniques in more detail. They give you a good method for conveying the information. Next chapter dives into the specifics of how to _write_ them. 

## Communicate through character

> Convey information only when it's relevant to the character. And do so in a way that tells us _more_ about this character.

This is the easiest way to drop information here and there. I often add information this way when revising, adding one or two lines here and there throughout the book. I find the character who is most likely to think or consider this information, and find a slower moment in which it would fit.

Your hero visits a church. If the hero is an artist, they might describe it through visuals and colors. If they're an architect, they might describe the architecture instead. If they're religious, they focus on the cultural aspect. 

All of that is fine. You can add a paragraph or two with them just _thinking_ about it, describing the world through their lens. But don't give one character multiple lenses. If you really want to describe all of that, have the different characters visit the church at different times ;)

Your hero visits a church. A major storyline is their friendship with another character (A). How can you efficiently showcase the church _and_ reveal character? A simple line like: "Man, A would have _loved_ the patterns engraved in these walls. I should take her with me next time, we spend less and less time together."

You've described the church. You've introduced A. You've also introduced their relationship and a possible conflict waiting to happen. With only two lines of worldbuilding!

### Logical Leaps

The key here is something I call **logical leaps**. If you can create a logical connection for the reader between one paragraph and the next, you can get away with explaining a lot. 

If one paragraph states they miss home, then it's natural that the next paragraph recalls a memory from home. (Which you can use to sprinkle some more worldbuilding into the story!)

If, instead, one paragraph states they miss home, and the next one delves into the history of swordfighters ... that second paragraph will completely halt the story and feel like an "infodump".

### Motivations

An easy way to make such a leap, is by employing **character motivations**. 

* Give your character a simple goal
* But they must _use_ (or at least _consider_) some part of your unique world to accomplish this

This way, it's natural to "explain" this information, and the reader will be excited and follow along.

{{% example %}}
Continuing the theme of our previous examples: your hero doesn't just visit a church at random. They visit a church because they're trying to find an important priest that has information they need!

This simple motivation ("find priest, learn secrets") naturally leads them to visit the church, search through its chambers, and perhaps discuss its history (to convince the priest or get them to talk).

## Infodumps versus Teaching

For those unaware, the term "infodump" refers to stories that _dump_ a large wall of text into the story, with the sole purpose of telling the reader some _info_. It's very much frowned upon.

Sometimes, you can't do without them. And there's no clear threshold on how long a piece of information needs to be to become an "infodump", so some people already call one paragraph of explaining an "infodump".

Generally speaking, though, you don't want this.

### How to Teach

Instead, you should approach all information about your world (that you want to explain) as **teaching**. You are _teaching_ your reader how the world works.

And what's the best way to teach something?

* Give tiny bits of information that are immediately relevant
* Spread them out, with some gaps in between.
* Regularly remind people about the essentials (in varied ways)

Spend five paragraphs explaining how a culture (in your world) works ... and the reader is bored. They will forget all of that. The story is stopped dead in its tracks to turn into homework.

And yes, I'm calling homework and school extremely inefficient ways of teaching as well. My grudge against educational systems is a well-known fact at this point. Why do you think I created this whole tutorial website?
{{% /remark %}}

Instead, spend _one_ paragraph explaining something about the culture.

A few chapters later, use another paragraph or two. Also _repeat_ an essential statement from before, something the reader must remember to make sense of the story later on.

Keep doing this---give a new tidbit of info, then let it be for a few chapters---until you have eventually explained _everything_!

This way, the story never grinds to a halt, and the information actually _sticks_. 

This does require planning on your end. You need to be smart about how you "chop" your world into pieces of information, and when you tell what. I'm not saying it's easy---that's why infodumps are still a thing in many books---but it's absolutely the better way to do it.

## An example: epigraphs

This technique is _very_ common among writers, because it literally uses the system I just described.

An epigraph is a short piece of text _before_ a chapter starts.

In many (fantasy) books, each chapter will start with an _excerpt_ from a journal, book, conversation, history lesson, whatever. This means you dole out these _tidbits_ of information, every chapter, which combine to convey a huge amount of information. (The important part is, therefore, that these epigraphs are really short and you only include them once in a while.)

You must realize, however, that not all readers will read them. (Most will, some will automatically skip it.) So you usually want to reinforce them in the main text anyway, or make the worldbuilding details not _essential_ to know.

### A longer example

I'm currently writing one of my Wildebyte books. In it, I try to craft stories around games and how computers work.

This means I have to teach important (and not necessarily _easy_) concepts about how computers and code work!

For example, I have to teach the GPU (responsible for graphics). What do I do? I break it down into parts.

* The GPU is for graphics, completely separate from the CPU (for calculations).
* They calculate what the camera is looking at.
* Then convert that into pixels (through rasterization).
* They are parallel: all pixels are calculated _at the same time_.

Each part can then be broken down even further. I try to attach the details to the plot.

* The fact that graphics and code are separate, for example, means that things can _change appearance_! Just because you coded something to be a table, doesn't mean it has to _look_ like a table. This sets up a mystery about a shapeshifting enemy they have to track.
* The fact it is parallel, means different pixels cannot communicate with each other. This sets up a funny scene about miscommunication.

The crucial thing here is that I don't allow parts to be too big and I never introduce multiple parts in the same chapter. As of right now, you only learn the existence of GPU in chapter 2, its separation from the CPU in chapter 4, that it converts stuff to pixels in chapter 7, etcetera.

The information is small. It is spread out. And where possible, it's directly tied into the plot and the mysteries. But once you combine all of that, near the end of the book, you have learned how a GPU works _and_ the climax can happen (which uses that information).

## Force it to happen

The previous example (from Wildebyte) shows the second most powerful technique for communicating setting.

> Make something _happen_ that forces thoughts or discussion about the information into the story.

For example, say your world has an important class of magical objects. You want to communicate what they look like and what they do.

A very subtle writing mistake would be to give such a magical object to the hero from the start. They carry it around, which means they will _think_ about it, right? When they look at it, they can naturally explain it to the reader.

While this is _fine_, it's not ideal. Why would they describe the object they're very familiar with? Why convey this information as a thought (or maybe dialogue), when you could also ... make something _happen_.

Instead, in chapter 5, the hero _receives_ this magical object. They haven't seen it before. They don't know what it does, and neither do the people around them. As such, they _figure out_ how it works and they _ask around_ for details. Once they actually use it for something, you _show_ what it does.

This is a more natural and active way to convey the same information.

It's also harder to pull off and takes more time. That's why it's not as easy to "add" or "change" in revision as the first tip about character lenses.

This is something to keep in mind all the time as you plot a story.

See my previous example as well. I don't just want to _tell_ how a GPU works, Wildebyte has to discover this information by _solving mysteries_ and _using the things he learns_.

## Setup a mentor-student relationship

This brings me to the third (and last) general technique for conveying information naturally. Once you know this, you'll see it in _many_ stories.

> Setup a situation in which one character is the _mentor_ (who knows all the information) and another is the _student_. This way, you can communicate details simply by having the student ask questions, which the mentor answers.

It's not the best, which is why I put it in third place. But it's still more natural and fun than just explaining the info outright. Additionally, by adding a human component, you can add variation and twists. 

Maybe the mentor holds back some of the information. Maybe they lie about something. Maybe the student is lost and helpless when the mentor disappears and they can't ask questions anymore.

_Integrate_ your worldbuilding communication into your plot and characters. If you do that, you can get away with explaining _a lot_, and it never feels bad.

Harry Potter does this. Hermione has "book knowledge", Ron has "wizarding world knowledge", and Harry has "no knowledge at all" ;) This means that they can constantly ask each other questions, especially Harry, and get answers. A fast and smooth way to convey information.

## Name it, drop it

Earlier, I mentioned the need to "imply" or "promise" you did more worldbuilding than you actually put into the story. Especially as a fantasy author, you will often "subtly imply" that there's more going on in the world. But you will give that information later, at a better moment. (Or you don't give it at all, it remains a hint towards a greater world.)

If you do one aspect of your world with great care and depth, you can imply the other aspects and the reader will trust you.

But how do you do that? With a dead-simple technique I call "name it, drop it".

> You simply name relevant events, locations or characters that the character would know about ... then continue with the rest of the scene without explanation.

Again, your characters _live_ in this world. If they mention some great event from a hundred years ago, chances are _everyone_ knows what they mean and has learned of this event. So they can just mention the name and move on.

"Have you seen the news? Fighting has broken out at the border between---"

"Yeah, I saw it alright. It's worse than the Bulrach Revolution. Let me tell you this: there will be even more casualties than in Bulrach when this is over."

Both characters spoke of common knowledge, so there's no need to elaborate and the conversation can continue about something else. But with this simple technique, you've now added more detail and richness to your world.

This is another technique you will notice in many stories, now that you know about it.
