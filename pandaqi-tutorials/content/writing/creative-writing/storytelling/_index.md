If you want to tell a story in any way, start here. It takes you by the hand with a _practical_ guide to getting started, improving your skill, and publishing a finished book. It also links to other courses about the details, such as _plot_ or _character_, whenever they come into play. This course is the "master course", if you want, which connects all the different pieces that come into play when writing a book or a script.
