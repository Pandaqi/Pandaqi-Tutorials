This is the second chapter about sentence structure. Probably the most important set of tips and advice about prose you will ever encounter. So let's not waste more time on an introduction and dive right into another crucial tip.

## Remove sensing verbs

If "vary your sentence length" was the mother of all writing advice, then this is surely the eldest daughter. (Not sure how well that metaphor works, but we're going with it.)

Whenever you tell a story, you're telling it _through the eyes of the narrator_. Unless you have an omniscient narrator---who is objective and stands outside the narrative---this point of view will come from a main character within the story.

This means two things.

* How they tell the story might not be entirely _true_. This reveals their character even more. Use that!
* They can only tell things that they experience. This means any **sensing verb** (such as "see" or "hear") is a waste of space.

{{% example %}}
"I see birds flying overhead." => "Bird fly overhead."
{{% /example %}}

You're telling the story! The only reason you can mention the birds, is because you _see_ them! There's no reason for characters to add sensing verbs.

{{% example %}}
"He hears rustling leaves and decides to turn on his flashlight." => "Rustling leaves cause him to turn on his flashlight."
{{% /example %}}

The only reason you mention rustling leaves, is because you _hear_ them! No need to explain how hearing works with every sentence.

{{% example %}}
"I feel her leg sliding against mine." => "Her leg slides against mine."
{{% /example %}}

The idea remains the same with all these examples.

Remove sensing verbs to make sentences shorter and simpler. Also do it to increase immersion and _really_ get into the skin of the character narrating the story.

## Keep related words together

Certain sayings, verbs or clauses consist of multiple words. As your head is formulating a sentence, it might be tempted to _push these words apart_. 

This is not recommended. Keep related parts of the sentence together. Proximity is a _great_ tool to help the reader understand what parts of the text relate to each other. (Similarly, move things _further_ apart to make sure the reader knows they're unrelated.)

When does this mistake generally happen?

* **Infinitive**: a construction of "to + verb", where the two elements are separated.
* **Split verb**: a construction where the verb requires a preposition.
* **Object**: if the verb is done _to_ someone, we call them the object. Put them as close to subject + verb as you can.
* **Pronouns + Antecedents**: a pronoun references something from earlier. Put the thing it references as _close_ before it as possible. This also prevents confusion about _what_ the pronoun references.

{{% example %}}
INFINITIVE: "Don't try to, I don't know, foolishly jump from the highest rooftop."

TOGETHER: "Don't try to jump from the highest rooftop, you fool."
{{% /example %}}

The first version of the sentence can be a very colorful way for a character to speak. But for clarity, it's awful.

{{% example %}}
SPLIT VERB: "He decided to split the chickens up"

TOGETHER: "He decided to split up the chickens"
{{% /example %}}

Another reason why you don't want to end sentences with prepositions. (As explained in the previous chapter.)

{{% example %}}
OBJECT: "He threw the ball, as fast as possible, which still meant a lousy pace for him, to his teammate." 

TOGETHER: "He threw the ball to his teammate, as fast as possible, though that still meant a lousy pace."
{{% /example %}}

The first version might seem fun (again). But do this for a whole book, and it just becomes a mess that's near impossible to sift through. Prefer clarity and branching to the right.

{{% example %}}
PRONOUN: "James was a great musician and the best friend of John. He was the youngest graduate of the local conservatory."

What does "he" refer to in the second sentence? James or John?

TOGETHER: "James was a great musician and the youngest graduate of the local conservatory. John was his best friend."
{{% /example %}}

## Control your lists

A good way to make your prose more _efficient_ is to present information as a list (within one sentence). It prevents having to repeat subject or verb, or use pronouns to refer to previous sentences.

{{% example %}}
"Sarah was smart. She was also young and fashionable." => "Sarah was smart, young and fashionable."
{{% /example %}}

The meaning of a sentence, however, changes based on how many elements you mention.

### One

Giving only _one_ piece of information is obviously the most **powerful** and **focused**. That one statement surely reaches the reader.

{{% example %}}
She was strong.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
My son bursts with energy.
{{% /example %}}

### Two

Giving _two_ pieces of information automatically creates a **comparison** or **contrast**. The reader will automatically equate them or compare them.

{{% example %}}
She was strong and smart.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
My son bursts with energy, but learned to stay calm.
{{% /example %}}

### Three

Giving _three_ pieces of information feels the most **complete** and **full**. Three is a crowd. There's a reason many speeches talk in triplets. It feels satisfying to us.

Similarly, a common narrative structure is to have an event happen _three_ times in your plot. First time, the hero fails, but learns nothing. Second time, they fail, but finally change their ways. Third time, they succeed.

{{% example %}}
She was strong, smart and adventurous.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
My son bursts with energy, but learned to stay calm and relaxed.
{{% /example %}}

### Four

If your sentence has _four_ pieces of information ... you want to rethink it. Any time I encounter such a sentence in a book---one that lists off a bunch of related things---my eyes glaze over and none of it sticks.

If you _do_ go for this, consider some punctuation to help yourself out. Turn the list into something more structured.

{{% example %}}
She had it all: strong, smart, adventurous, friendly, and even humorous.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
Even when my son bursts with energy, he stays calm, relaxed, and assesses his options---just like I trained him.
{{% /example %}}

## Phrases that grow on verbs

People tend to hide their true statement in a sea of words. Especially people who are reserved or afraid to commit to something. In prose, this merely doubles the word count, while removing clarity.

This is best exemplified through phrases that "grow on verbs".

### Trying = Doing

{{% example %}}
LONG: Sarah tries to open the door. The attacker tries to block it with his arm and wins. 

SHORT: Sarah opens the door. The attacker blocks it with is arm.
{{% /example %}}

"Trying" to do something ... just means doing something. When you use "try", you usually signal that they might _fail_. More efficient prose is to simply _do_ something, then show that it failed the next sentence.

Sometimes, there's a verb that means "trying to do X". One verb is better than two verbs (and shorter), so use it.

{{% example %}}
LONG: Mark tries to grab the gun.

SHORT: Mark reaches for the gun.
{{% /example %}}

### Other examples

Other examples are constructions with _seems to, tends to, should have to, might want to, ..._

{{% example %}}
LONG: He tends to enjoy long walks on the beach, but he seems distracted today.

SHORT: He enjoys long walks on the beach, but today he's distracted.
{{% /example %}}

The idea is simply to check if your sentence has multiple verbs, some of which don't really mean anything. In most cases, you can just rewrite to leave them out, and the prose becomes stronger.

## Nouns containing Verbs

Most languages have a way to turn verbs into nouns. _To judge_ has the noun _judgment_. _To observe_ has the noun _observation_.

A sentence becomes shorter and simpler if you use the **verb** instead of the **noun**, if possible.

{{% example %}}
"It is the judgment of the panel that your presentation was awful." => "The panel judges your presentation to be awful."
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
"It is up for consideration." => "He considers it."
{{% /example %}}

## Extra spice

In my view, crystal clear and simple prose is the _starting point_. That's the base level you want to set.

Because if you do, you are free to _tweak_ the prose throughout your novel to be slightly more fancy or advanced. You know that 95% of it is super clear and simple. This gives you the freedom to mess this up here and there.

Try a different sentence structure. Try some new words or phrasings. See if you can add more rhythm or flow to a text by describing things in a different way that might be "less efficient".

A unique writing _style_ is one of the benefits authors can have. It's something unique to books, something that can make _your_ prose stand out. So even though these tips are great guidelines for at least 80% of your prose, you _should_ experiment with adding your own flair and breaking these rules.

{{% remark %}}
If we're honest, it's perhaps my greatest area of improvement. I write extremely efficient and practical, which means I don't have a clear style and don't really get poetic or stylish. It means that I sometimes write a story and ask myself: "Couldn't literally any other author have written it this way? Why would people buy _my_ books?"
{{% /remark %}}

How would you add this extra spice?

* Using [Tropes](../tropes) (next chapter) or figurative language. Things such as metaphors, puns, anticlimax, etcetera.
* Changing your **overall perspective**. Any event, any part of your world, can be narrated in infinitely many ways. As a writer, you choose your focus and your angle into the story. Picking a unique angle (say, narrating a story from the perspective of a _building_) automatically leads to a unique writing style.
* Go for the thing that is **interesting**. If it's interesting to you, it will be interesting to others who like your style or way of storytelling. So lean into that.
* Go for the thing that is **odd**. A million writers have written about the night being dark and the wind feeling like a hurricane bla bla. Find the odd description. Find what's extraordinary about this event, this character, this paragraph you're writing. Lean into that with utmost sincerity. Write about the night feeling lighter than the day or an actual hurricane your main character barely feels.

## Conclusion

That concludes the two chapters on sentence structure. Applying these techniques will surely save you hundreds of thousands of words. For free! And the prose only becomes _clearer_ and _nicer_ to read.

In the end, the lesson I've learned about _all_ art is this: _Clarity trumps all._

If your audience has no clue what they're even reading, your story could be amazing and they'd never know. If your audience doesn't understand how cool your first chapter is, they'll put the book away and never move past it.

When in doubt, read back what you wrote and ask yourself what the _point_ of this paragraph is. If the text itself doesn't clearly prove the reason for its existence, you either have muddy prose, or prose that can be cut from the story entirely.
