Tropes are literary techniques to enrich prose. They might not actually change the meaning or add new information, but they will make the prose _sound_ more interesting and engaging. I also name these techniques "figurative language", but that's simply because it is a more literal translation of the word we use in Dutch for this phenomenon.

Before I tell you the most common tropes, I need to warn you. Many beginning writers are told to add "metaphors" and "similes" left and right, as if every sentence needs to be compared to something else to make the prose good. A similar thing might happen with any other trope.

The truth is that tropes are a _bonus_. They're the cherry on top. You apply them once in a while to enhance prose that already works, but you don't apply them _all the time_, nor in a way that obscures meaning

Then where does this advice come from? Because a well-placed metaphor _is_ a great addition to your prose. When done right, at the right time, tropes like these really set apart your prose from that of anyone else. 

So yes, try to learn and incorporate these tropes. But use them sparingly---when most needed---instead of forcing them in all the time.

My general rule of thumb is ...

> Only use a trope if you couldn't achieve the same effect or information another way (or the other way takes significantly more words).

## How to use tropes (badly)

A common example is the metaphor or simile. Beginning writers might write sentences like "the snow was as white as milk" or "the dark night was the color of a screen turned off". They might even be pretty happy with themselves for coming up with these tropes.

This, however, serves no purpose and just wastes space. We already know snow is white. We already know night is dark and black. "White as milk" tells me nothing, especially because different types of milk have slightly different off-white colors. "Color of a screen turned off" has the same issue.

You might as well have written "the snow was as white as something colored similar to snow, but with no specific indication of the actual color".

Only use this trope if it actually _adds_ information. If it's the quickest way to communicate something new or unique to the reader. If you find yourself writing a whole paragraph to describe what something looks like or how somebody acts, check if you can find a _single_ striking image to compare it to.

{{% example %}}
I once wrote a book where somebody visits a magic school. (It's in Dutch, though it might appear in English at some point.)

Upon first arrival, I obviously had to describe the school. In my head, there were these rows of lanterns spiraling around the school. But they weren't completely consistent, partially because the school was built on a hill and the whole grounds were covered in snow.

After writing a clunky long paragraph to explain this image in detail, I replaced it with a comparison. "It looked like an octopus: the school building its body, the lanterns its flailing tentacles that covered the entire grounds."

To me, that was a fun image, and a way more efficient way to get across the general image in my head.

The same is true for the other tropes. Use them when they lead to fun and interesting prose which is more efficient than regular sentences. Don't force them in everywhere because you think it will make your prose "professional" or whatever.

## Understate

### Euphemism

A softer word instead of a harsh one.

{{% example %}}
He died. => He **passed away**.
{{% /example %}}

### Understatement

A weakened statement, while it's clear that something was a big deal.

{{% example %}}
We sold **a tiny bit less** than expected: only 2 out of the 2000 hamburgers we had made.
{{% /example %}}

### Litotes

A weakened statement using a double negative.

{{% example %}}
He was in favor of the idea. => He **wasn't against** the idea.
{{% /example %}}

## Exaggerate

### Hyperbole 

An exaggerated statement.

{{% example %}}
John had been waiting for Mark **for centuries**.

A **deafening** sound. (You're not literally deaf after you've heard it, it was just very loud.)
{{% /example %}}

## Emphasize

### Irony

When you say one thing, but you mean the opposite. Or the reverse of what you expected happens.

{{% example %}}
"Wow, that shirt doesn't look ugly at all!" (a subcategory called **sarcasm**)

The murder scene investigator was arrested for killing his girlfriend.
{{% /example %}}

### Prolepsis

Placing an important word at the beginning of a sentence, or important sentence at the beginning of a paragraph for emphasis.

{{% example %}}
**That clown**, boy do I have a bone to pick with him.
{{% /example %}}

### Anticipation 

Opposite of prolepsis; placing words at the end.

{{% example %}}
"The biggest, the best, the funniest: **Mike Wazowski!**"
{{% /example %}}

### Repetition

Repeating a certain element or phrase. Simplest form of enumeration.

{{% example %}}
**Well, well, well,** what do we have here?
{{% /example %}}

### Enumeration

Putting different elements of a list directly after each other.

{{% example %}}
That **lying, cheating, devious** man---I don't trust him at all
{{% /example %}}

As you might have noticed, I almost always use three elements after each other in the examples. As stated before, enumeration in threes is generally the most satisfying.

### Pleonasm

Using an adjective in front of a word that already contains that property. Basically, this means placing a redundant word in your sentence. Only use it for emphasis purposes.

{{% example %}}
The **green grass** was moved by the mild breeze.

**White snow** completely covered our roof in less than an hour.
{{% /example %}}

### Tautology

Using different words with (nearly) the exact same meaning in the same sentence. Again, redundant words are only good if you mean to emphasize them.

{{% example %}}
The plaza was **desolate** and **abandoned.**

I am **delighted** and **excited**!
{{% /example %}}

### Antithesis

Contrasting antonyms by using them in a combination or after each other in a sentence.

{{% example %}}
It was a party for **young** and **old**.

They kept partying until the **late morning**, when the **sun** had already pushed away the **moon**.
{{% /example %}}

## Make the reader think

### Paradox

If we assume one part of the sentence to be true, the other part can never be true. Therefore, the whole sentence can never be true nor false.

{{% example %}}
Then the president of the United States spoke: "All Americans always lie!"

If a being is omnipotent, then it can limit its own ability to perform actions and hence it cannot perform all actions, yet, on the other hand, if it cannot limit its own actions, then that is---straight off---something it cannot do.
{{% /example %}}

### Rhetorical Question

A question put in such a way that we already know the (expected) answer.

{{% example %}}
Who doesn't want to make lots of money?

Don't you think an eclipse is an incredible phenomenon?
{{% /example %}}

## Comical effect

### Word Play / Pun

Using words in a different way than expected or making funny connections. Most often seen in riddles or jokes, but can be subtly put into a story. More technically, a word play happens when you use _one expression_ to actually mean or refer to _multiple meanings_. There's a high "density of meaning" in that one expression.

{{% example %}}
What happens to a frog's car when it breaks down? It gets toad away.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
I never wanted to believe that my Dad was stealing from his job as a road worker. But when I got home, all the signs were there.
{{% /example %}}

## Metaphors and Imagery

### Simile

Compares two things through explicit use of certain words (_as, like, so, than_).

{{% example %}}
The sun set **like** a field of drowsing roses.

It was as good **as** new.
{{% /example %}}

### Synaesthesia

Using several senses to describe something.

{{% example %}}
A **warm** voice that spoke **bitter** words.

**Sweet** songs painted by **tasty** colors.
{{% /example %}}

### Personification

Attributing human properties to something.

{{% example %}}
* Screaming colors.
* The clouds cried about what had happened.
* The future smiles at you!
{{% /example %}}

### Metaphor

A simile _without_ a concatenation word.

{{% example %}}
* Life is an obstacle course.
* He had a foggy glance in his eyes.
* "Clean your room, it's a pigsty here!"
{{% /example %}}

### Metonymy

Comparing using a different area where the two things touch or contact. In general, you pick a single specific word to refer to a different concept that is tightly related.

{{% example %}}
Three **Rembrandts** were stolen from the museum. (Rembrandt => painting by him)

**England** lost the final match against Sweden. (England => The national team)

The **pen** is mightier than the **sword**. (Pen => written words, Sword => physical force)
{{% /example %}}

## Reverse Imagery

Usually, an imagery trope compares a very common word (such as "room") to a more specific image (such as "pigsty"). The metaphor helps explain details about that vague "room". It expands on it.

You can also do the reverse to _explain_ something you invented for your own story.

How? You compare something specific (that is common knowledge) to an unknown idea, to explain that idea.

{{% example %}}
Let's say there are these really valuable magical objects in my story called the "Crowaca". (Yes, I started with the word Crown and then just changed some letters.)

Within this world, it would make sense for characters to _know_ about this and use it in speech or narration. So you can use reverse imagery to explain what they are.

For example: "She just accidentally dropped that diamond ring? I don't believe it. That would be like somebody stealing the Crowaca, losing it on the way home, and pretending it's no big deal."

Or maybe: "He carefully handled the ancient scroll, as if it was the last Crowaca."
{{% /example %}}

This is a bit more of an advanced concept, mostly helpful in fantasy and sci-fi. I still wanted to mention it because of how powerful it is. It allows you to multitask: you enhance your prose _and_ get worldbuilding/explanation for free!

## Flow

These are more about how to structure a longer piece of text (paragraph, maybe even a whole chapter) in a way that feels satisfying. (I decided to move a few tropes specific to flow and rhythm to the next chapter, which is all about that topic!)

### Climax

From bad to worse. You start with something mildly annoying, and then it gets out of hand.

{{% example %}}
First the mob was calm, then people started to push and pull, soon a riot had arisen on the sides, and within minutes you had to make sure you got out of there.
{{% /example %}}

### Anti-climax

Reverse climax. You start with a very bad event, and then decrease impact.

{{% example %}}
He groaned from the pain, rolled back and forth, until he slowed down, and eventually stopped moving.
{{% /example %}}

### Chiasmus

Sometimes called a **cross statement**. You first mention two things in a certain order, and then later on mention them (or related elements) again in reverse order.

{{% example %}}
**Ladies** and gentlemen, boys and **girls**.

He said he didn't know, knowing he could never say the words.

The windows shut, he had closed every door.

Do I love you because you're beautiful? Or are you beautiful because I love you?
