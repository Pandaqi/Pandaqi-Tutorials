This course is slowly moving towards bigger and more "advanced" elements of prose. Rhythm and Flow are topics that the beginning writer would probably just ignore, and that's fine. Focus on getting a readable story on the page first.

Once you're comfortable doing that, however, you want to make the writing _sing_! You want to add that little extra that makes it stand out. You want to make sure the reader never has to reread a sentence, never fails to imagine the picture you painted, is never taken out of the flow. You want the prose to be consistently interesting and fun.

This chapter explains my best techniques for accomplishing this.

## Metrum

What is "rhythm"? Well, it's a _repeating pattern_. When you listen to the drums in a pop/rock song, you'll notice they create rhythm by playing the exact same thing over and over, every bar. If they were to constantly hit random parts of the drum kit, there wouldn't be a rhythm you can feel.

The same thing can be applied to prose. Whereas music has beats and notes, prose has _syllables_ that can either be _stressed_ or _unstressed_!

For example, the word "com<span class="underline">pu</span>ter" stresses the syllable "pu". The word "a<span class="underline">way</span>" stresses "way". Single syllable words can be stressed or unstressed, depending on what you choose.

We call this a _metrum_ (or _meter_).

> A metrum is a simple "rule" that the syllables in your line must follow.

If you listen to a lot of music, and especially if you _make_ music yourself, you'll naturally have a good ear for this. Again, I don't want you to memorize such rules and consciously apply them to _every line_. It would be exhausting and overwhelming!

Instead, once in a while, take a few crucial lines and try to apply a meter to them. Over time, this practice will seep into your brain and cause you to _subconsciously_ come up with prose that follows such rules.

So, how does it work? 

* You invent a pattern.
* This pattern tells you _how many syllables_ the line can have. (For example, if the pattern has length three, the number of syllables in your sentence must be a multiple of three.)
* But also where the _stressed_ syllables should fall.

### An example

A very simple pattern is just "yes no" (stressed unstressed).

* The line should have a number of syllables that's a multiple of two. (Otherwise the pattern won't fit.)
* And any time the pattern repeats, the first syllable should be stressed.

A line that does **not** fit would be: "<span class="underline">Keep</span> your <span class="underline">hands</span> off of my com<span class="underline">pu</span>ter!"

A line following the metrum would be: "<span class="underline">Stay</span> a<span class="underline">way</span> from <span class="underline">my</span> com<span class="underline">pu</span>ter!"

Now, this is a bit subjective, but I think the second line reads much more easily.

Another line that does **not** fit: "<span class="underline">Don't</span> pre<span class="underline">tend</span> like <span class="underline">you</span> know <span class="underline">ev</span>erything, Tom!"

And now a version that does fit: "<span class="underline">Don't</span> pre<span class="underline">tend</span> your <span class="underline">know</span>ledge <span class="underline">has</span> no <span class="underline">bound</span>, Tom!"

{{% remark %}}
The only requirement I'd say is always true, is that the final syllable of the line should not be stressed. It would feel like the sentence was abruptly cut off or left unresolved. If you need to modify your pattern on its final repetition to accomplish that, so be it.

### A visual example

Some people have an easier time understanding this idea when they visualize the metrum. See the image below.

## Ladder of Abstraction

In the earlier chapter [Pyramid of Abstraction](../pyramid-of-abstraction/), I explained the difference between concrete and abstract language. I also explained how you _generally_ want to start with concrete first and abstract later.

On a smaller scale (paragraphs, parts of a scene), however, it turns more into a ladder of abstraction. On the low end, you have very specific and concrete language. Higher up the ladder, you have sweeping and general statements.

As you edit your prose, you constantly want to **climb up and down the ladder**.

Just like you want to vary your sentence length and structure, you want to vary how concrete or abstract your statements are.

You've been giving very specific details for a while? Switch to more abstract language.

You've just given some difficult philosophical statements? Back off and switch to small, physical details.

Imagine somebody giving a speech or lecture. If they were talking at the same volume, pitch and speed all the time---that would get pretty boring wouldn’t it? If two or three sentences were spoken in the exact same way, that would be fine. But more of that, and the speech loses its rhythm and becomes a blur of words. 

In that sense, going back and forth between levels of abstraction also makes the text more readable, much in the same way punctuation does.

{{% example %}}
Once upon a time, there was a high school, called Junior High. It was known for its knowledgeable staff and simplicity in teaching methods. (**abstract**) 

It stood there tall, brown, with a red roof and dark blue doors. (**less abstract**)

And on a certain Monday, Peter went inside those doors. He was young, only twelve years old. Bright, getting good grades, yet with an awful memory—he couldn’t even remember what he had eaten yesterday. (**concrete**)

But little did he know that his world would soon be turned upside down. (**abstract again**)

## Keep a focus

I don't know if you can call this a "mistake", but it certainly annoys me when I read novels: writers who keep changing focus all the time. They write a few paragraphs in the current time, then immediately jump to a memory, back to current time, flashback, to a different problem entirely, and so forth. Usually the scenes are _really_ short as well.

This is jarring, hard to read, and breaks immersion. It feels like a first draft: the writer just wanted to get their jumble of thoughts on the page ... but never actually rearranged the pieces to flow more easily.

Yes, add variation and switch your focus regularly. But _do_ keep a focus on _one thing_ for longer periods of time!

If you notice you have ten paragraphs about a topic scattered across two chapters, consider consolidating them into _one_ focused moment.

If you keep interrupting your story for flashbacks and memories, consider actually _telling_ those flashbacks/memories as their own scene (at the moment they happened).

If something is important enough to be mentioned several times (even in short spurts), it's probably important enough to get the spotlight for a longer period of time. If not, cut it entirely.

This is another reason why revision is so important! Your first draft will surely lack focus and have puzzle pieces scattered around. When revising, pull related topics together to make sure you at least keep focus on the same problem or theme for a few pages.

## Consistency

A subtle prose mistake is to be inconsistent with how you phrase things. As somebody consumes your prose, you're basically teaching them _how_ to read your prose. You're showing the sentence structures you like to employ, the words you like to use, in what situations you reach for a trope, and so forth.

Once you've shown this, it's a bit uncomfortable and jarring to (accidentally) _break_ it.

Sure, you can evolve and change your writing style, but preferably not _at random, within the same book_ ;)

As always, the rule can be broken, if that is your desired effect: to signal a sudden change or jarring situation.

That's the first (slightly obvious) tip: **be consistent with your writing style**.

Maybe I do my best to never use a "modern sounding" word in my fantasy book. If I accidentally slip in a few of them near the end, the readers will be confused, as if another narrator took over the story.

Or I might like to write one-word sentences. ("I've lost my wallet. Great. Awesome.") That's a structure that the reader learns when they start reading your book. If you suddenly stop doing that halfway through the book, it will feel jarring.
{{% /example %}}

This is a vague tip, however, that completely depends on your writing style. A more specific one that can help most writers is to look at this on a smaller scale: the level of a single sentence or paragraph.

If one part of your sentence follows a certain "structure" to phrase things, you want the other part to use the same structure.

{{% example %}}
INCONSISTENT: "She was smart, young and able to be nice to people she just met."

CONSISTENT: "She was smart, young and friendly."
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
INCONSISTENT: "He liked kicking a ball and basketball."

CONSISTENT: "He liked soccer and basketball." (Or: "He liked kicking a ball and throwing a ball through hoops.")
{{% /example %}}

Similarly, if your paragraph starts with a certain type of phrase, it can be really satisfying to end with the same type of phrase (but perhaps slightly changed). Such consistency (through symmetry) gives a nice closure and flow.

You will find many of these tips on rhythm in _speech writing_. Study famous speeches to see all this in action and learn from it.

## Tropes

These three tropes felt out of place in the previous chapter (which was also growing quite long). They don't really emphasize, or exaggerate, or add information, or anything like that. 

They just make things _sound_ better. They just make the prose read more _smoothly_, more like a poem or a song. Using them regularly will make your prose pop just a little more.

### Alliteration 

Starting multiple words with the same letter. Best when used on only two words right next to each other, or three or four throughout the sentence. Can easily be overdone.

The **o**pen **o**bstacle made its way towards the **p**rotected **p**alace.

{{% example %}}
As he **d**oubted and **d**oted, he **g**rew more fond of the **g**listening **g**arden.
{{% /example %}}

### Assonance

Using the same vowel sounds. It's a weakened form of rhyming, which is often used well in songs, but goes unnoticed in writing. Don't think that means that it doesn't enhance your writing---just that a reader needs to speak the words in his head to find the rhythm.

### Onomatopoeia

A word that phonetically imitates, resembles or suggests the source of the sound that it describes. Basically, reading the word makes you think or feel its meaning, rather than simply remembering the meaning and reading on. Using these can sometimes look childish, but usually work to your advantage.
