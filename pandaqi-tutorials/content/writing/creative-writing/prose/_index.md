Prose refers to the way you actually express your story on the page. The words, sentences and paragraphs you use to convey the right actions and ideas. It's **not** about plotting, coming up with great characters, or getting your book published. Aside from some technicalities, it's also **not** about [Grammar](../../english/).

As explained in the introduction of the course, Prose really encompasses two parts.

* Getting your thoughts onto paper in the first place (which is an essential skill to any writer, obviously).
* And _improving_ those initial sentences to read more easily and clearly. 

This course deals with both aspects in a practical and (hopefully) fun way.
