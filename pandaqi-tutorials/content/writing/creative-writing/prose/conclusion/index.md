Congratulations! You've finished this course on Prose. Now go and write/read many more stories. It's the only way to keep improving your prose. 

Use the tips from the first chapters to get your thoughts onto the page. Eliminate self-doubt, or criticism, or forcing yourself to follow any rules while writing that _first draft_.

Once done, take some time off. Then come back and, using this guide as reference, sharpen that prose through rewriting and even more rewriting.

I have written millions of words for many different projects and purposes. (Dutch and English, fiction and non-fiction, websites and novels, etcetera.) But I _still_ mess up my prose in the first draft. I still write clunky paragraphs and lines that are twice as long as they need to be. That's a natural side-effect of trying to sort your thoughts and put them into coherent sentences.

With every book you write, you get better at delivering a clean first draft. But the issue never goes away---nobody gets things right the first time.

So, in short, how do you write great prose? Write terrible prose first, then improve it through hundreds of tips and techniques you learn over time.

As always, this course is part of a bigger category called [Creative Writing](../../../creative-writing/). If you haven't already, I recommend starting with the [Storytelling](../../storytelling/) course that teaches how to write books from start to finish. It links to related topics (such as plotting or developing characters) wherever needed.

With these courses, I really tried to distill _everything_ I know and learned from _years_ of writing into practical and interesting articles. 

{{% remark %}}
All writing courses combined have been the largest writing project I ever did. It was silly of me to think that it would just be "a few weekends of work". And I still regularly think "I'm so stupid, I completely forgot to mention this one tip I learned, I need to add that!"

Hopefully, I succeeded and helped a few people out there!

Keep learning and keep writing,

Show & Tell
-----------

In the section on _rhythm_ we already discussed the **ladder of abstraction**. Good writing constantly move up and down that ladder, back and forth between concrete and abstract language.

This directly ties in with one of the most common writing advices: **show, don't tell**. But, it's an often misunderstood one-liner. Let's first see what 'show' and 'tell' actually mean:

To **show:** explaining or giving information by displaying action. You don't tell the reader how someone feels, but you show it through their actions.

Mark jabbed his fist into the wall, causing several paintings to drop down. He kicked the door open and slammed it shut less than a second later. They could still hear him grumble and stumble down the hallway.

To **tell:** explaining or giving information by simply telling it to the reader. You, as a sort of God, stand above the story and all characters and can tell the reader exactly how someone feels, what has happened, what will happen, etcetera.

Mark left the room angrily; Then Mark left the room. He was angry.

In real life, there isn't a person standing beside you all the time that knows all. Telling is therefore an unnatural way of displaying action, and it's preferred to show. However, when giving a description of a landscape for example, there is nobody around to display all the landscape's properties through action. That is when showing would be extremely weird, and it is better to tell.

Knowing this, we can rewrite that advice to: **whenever possible, show. Otherwise, tell.**

It's easy to relate this to the ladder of abstraction. _Showing_ means low on the ladder, while _telling_ is high.



Endings
-------

I'm just going to say it: endings are way more important than beginnings. Beginnings are not what makes a reader eager to read on---endings are. They should bring up new questions and new developments, and the reader thinks the next paragraph might contain all the answers. The only beginning that matters, is the very first paragraph of your story, from that moment on every paragraph and chapter needs a finishing sentence that makes the reader stay up at night.

There are lots of ways to create endings, but I've included a list of the most common ones:

*   **Closing the Circle:** The ending reminds us of the beginning by returning to an important place, re-introducing a key character, using the first paragraph again but in a slightly different way.
*   **The tie-back:** Tie your ending to some element in the body of your story. If that element is odd or off-beat, it is usually used for comical purposes.
*   **The time frame:** The writer creates a tick-tock structure with time advancing relentlessly. To end the story, the writer decides what should happen last.
*   **The space frame:** the writer is less concerned with time than with place or geography. To end, the writer decides our final destination.
*   **The payoff:** The longer the story, the more important the payoff. This does not require a "happy ending", but a satisfying one, a reward for a journey concluded, secret revealed or mystery solved.
*   **The epilogue:** The store ends, but life goes on.
*   **Problem and solution:** The writer frames the problem(s) at the top and then offers readers possible solutions and resolutions.
*   **The apt quote:** Often overused. Character speaks in endings, capturing in their own words a neat summary or distillation of what has come before.
*   **Look to the future:** What do you think will happen next? What is the likely consequence of this decision or those events?
*   **Mobilize the reader:** Point the reader in another direction. Attend this meeting, read that book, send an e-mail message to the senator, donate blood for victims of a disaster.
