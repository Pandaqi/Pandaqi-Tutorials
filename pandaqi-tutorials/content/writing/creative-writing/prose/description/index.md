Description is the prose type with which I struggled the most. I guess it's because I'm a very practical and hyperactive person, which means I generally don't have the patience to write a paragraph of description ;) My biggest task, every time I do a second draft, is to _add_ a lot of description.

On the one hand, this is fine. Description is the "laziest" way to communicate information to the reader. You literally _describe_ exactly what the reader should know. If you can communicate the same information some _other_ way, you'll only improve the story.

On the other hand, description provides a breather. As nothing is happening, it provides a calm moment in which the reader can catch their breath. For some types of information, it's even the fastest method to just say it literally. As such, leaving out description is dangerous as well.

The first stories I wrote were just _action, action, action_. I thought I was doing some amazing writing. The plot was always moving forward! There was always tension! In reality, my readers (friends and family) quickly gave up and told me that it was just _exhausting_ and _complicated_.

Stories need action and big events ... just as much as they need description and moments of calm.

As such, for each thought in your head, ask yourself the following ...

* Do I need to ramp up speed here, or do I need to calm down (after something tense already happened)?
* Can I communicate this information in a more interesting and active way? Or is description the best option?

## The best place for description

If you've read my other courses about story, you know that each story has three parts: Promise, Progress and Payoff. 

This is similar to the scene structure I proposed earlier (action/reaction), which had a Setup, Buildup, and Reflection.

Many writers advice you to "jump straight into the action". While the general idea is fine (don't waste the reader's time), this isn't good advice. 

You _need_ to start a scene with setup. Without it, the reader has no clue where they are, who the characters are, or why they should care.

{{% example %}}
Many chapters, even whole books, start with _dialogue_. And I am confused. I have _no_ idea who is speaking, what their voice sounds like, where they are, nothing! The line of dialogue just exists in a void and it makes it very hard to get into the scene.

Similarly, books start with characters immediately fighting or almost killing each other. And I don't care. I don't know who these people are. You haven't done enough setup for this fight to _mean_ anything to me. Setup is surely needed, just make sure you don't do it _too much_.

And how do you deliver setup? Through description. Open a scene by describing the room you're in. Open a scene by describing some magical artefact that will become important.

As a scene progresses, the amount of description shrinks, and the action speeds up.

So ask yourself the following as well ...

* Do I need to _setup_ something right now that I'll need later? If so, describe it at some earlier point.
* How far along are we in the scene? The further you are, the less you should grab _description_ as your prose tool.

The typical example of setup is (Checkhov's) Gun. If you know a scene will end with somebody being shot ... you need to describe that gun _before_ that moment. You need to setup that the gun exists in the room and what it looks like _before_ you can use it for action later.

## How to describe?

For the first draft, the answer is: any way you like. You have a picture in your head, or at least some idea, so describe that. If you haven't practice this (much), it will probably come out like a grocery list or a checklist.

The gun was black. It was as long as my forearm. It was too heavy for the young boy to carry. It was made five years ago in the steel factory along the lake. It looked brand new and the flames in the hearth made the barrel shine.
{{% /example %}}

That's fine! Get it out of your head, write it down.

The second question is _what_ to describe. For that, I maintain a few simple rules.

* Describe in a way that ALSO shows the character doing the describing. (So only mention things relevant to _that character_, if possible.)
* Describe using _emotion_ rather than _facts_. (Describing facts is the most boring thing you can do. If you can describe facts and mix it with emotional memories or connections for the character, it becomes more interesting.)
* Use all senses. (Not just sight and maybe hearing.)

Telling readers the exact colors, dimensions and history of a house is _boring_.

Describe how the color of a house scares your main character and makes it look "like a haunted house". Describe how the dimensions are so large they overwhelm the character. Describe the history only by mentioning events relevant to the character, maybe things they also lived through.

Description is another thing that a second draft can fix. Write it like a grocery list at first, then make the sentences prettier in the second draft.

Also, you only know what is truly _essential_ once you finish the book. Maybe you described a magical object with one line, thinking it was just some minor worldbuilding. But then the story progressed and this magical object suddenly became way more important. Now you can go back and expand this one line into a more full description. 

Alternatively, I sometimes spent a paragraph or two describing a place or a memory, which ended up being completely useless. So the second draft just cut those out or changed it to a single short sentence.

## Conclusion

Your thoughts should be firmly on "description" at the _start_ of scenes or storylines. Anything you use later, needs to be set up at some point. As you progress further, those thoughts should mostly disappear.

Use description for slower moments after the fast and furious ones. At other times, find more active means (dialogue, action) to show the same information.

And accept that description will read like a boring list in most first drafts.
