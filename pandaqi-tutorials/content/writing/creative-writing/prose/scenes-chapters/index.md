You are nearing the end of this course. Now that you can construct nice sentences and paragraphs, it's time to go one step further. Paragraphs are grouped into **scenes**, which are grouped into **chapters**.

A scene means one major event happening, usually restricted to one location and theme. (As soon as the current topic has been resolved, or people move to somewhere else, the scene ends.) 

A chapter might have one scene or it might have several scenes _related_ to the same idea. (I heavily prefer writing chapters as a single scene. Other authors can have five scenes in one chapter.)

In both cases, the idea remains the same as with sentences and paragraphs: **focus on one topic**. Scenes should focus on conveying _one_ general event. Chapters should similarly have a theme that all scenes inside share.

That's the whole point! These categorizations create structure and hierarchy that help the reader understand your prose. This is one of the "hidden" skills of experienced writers.

Beginning writers will often do too much in one scene. Or they'll start new chapters at random (or once they hit some arbitrary word limit). Even worse, they might enter multiple _different_ POVs within the same scene!

This rather small decision---how to break up your prose---can create a world of confusion and make your story hard to understand. You get better at it by writing and reading a lot. That helps sort your thoughts into "this is a scene, and this is another scene, but this isn't enough on its own and needs to be combined with a bigger scene"

To learn how to structure the _content_ of a scene, I refer you to all my other courses on [Creative Writing](../../../creative-writing). That's not a prose issue but an issue with plotting/character/storytelling.

This chapter delves into the few prose-related topics to consider.

## Starting a scene or chapter

I think it's worthwhile to really focus on the first _line_ and _paragraph_ of a new section. 

You're asking a lot of your reader. Every time a new section starts, they have to "get into" your story again. They have to focus on turning words on the page into a fun story inside their head. 

Make this transition as smooth as possible. Make sure the first few lines are short and simple. Make sure they contain something intriguing and interesting to hook the reader.

Most writers spend a disproportionate amount of time refining _firsts_: first chapter, first line of chapters, etcetera. Because it's the first hurdle. Once readers have jumped over it, they'll probably stick around for the rest. So make that first hurdle as low as possible.

Often, you can only find the perfect first paragraph once you've written the rest. Once you know the interesting content at the heart of this chapter. So don't obsess over this in your first draft; focus on it for later drafts.

Sometimes this clearly shows. The first ~3 chapters have this beautiful, efficient, clean prose. Then the author knows they've hooked the reader and stopped editing their work as tightly as before, with a drop in quality. 

You obviously don't want that. But it's better than the reverse: nobody gets past your first 3 chapters, because they're rubbish compared to the rest of the book.

## Ending a scene or chapter

The idea here is the same. If you want readers to continue, you need to dare them to put the book down! 

End your sections with strong, interesting lines that open up new possibilities.

I once wrote a story about an AI going rogue. Earlier in the chapter, I made a point about how all the machinery was still controlled by humans. How pressing a button was the final control over turning something on or off.

Then, as the day ends, the operators press the button to turn everything _off_. They check if everything is okay and then leave.

The final sentence of the chapter? "As the operator locked the door, one of the screens flashed on."

Those could be cliffhangers, sure. But they don't need to be. In fact, it gets a bit exhausting and superficial if you forcibly insert clich√© cliffhangers after every chapter.

Just end the section with a line that represents _forward momentum_. We learned something new this chapter, or a character made a huge decision, or something big happened. End with a line that tells the reader: "Yeah, this major thing occurred. Don't you want to know how this plays out?"

Often, this means simply _summarizing_ the chapter with one or two cool one-liners. (Remember the Pyramid of Abstraction? The chapter itself was filled with concrete details and action, so that you can _end_ on an abstract, more epic statement.)

I once wrote a chapter in which members of a family die one by one. (This sounds weird without context.) Repeatedly, they look death in the eyes, and then lose.

One of them, however, finally survives. The chapter ends with: "He looked death in the eyes, but it did not come for him this day."

This is a summary or conclusion to what happened in the chapter. It's also a subtle threat: "it did not come for him _this day_." That's the type of combination---closing a door, opening another---you typically want in a final sentence.

## Ideal length

Some authors write super short scenes, others write super long ones. There's no formula or rule here---I can only give statistics.

Throughout all my work, chapters have always been 1,000--3,000 words. I rarely have multiple scenes within a chapter, but if I do, I'd break the chapter in half. (So a typical scene would be 500--1,500 words.)

The general advice is the (slightly unhelpful): "make your chapters as long as you want / as long as the story needs"

Slightly better advice is: "make your chapters as long as they remain interesting"

I just told you to focus on _one_ thing. There aren't many single topics or events that _stay interesting_ once you've surpassed 3,000 words. If your chapter grows longer, it probably meanders, or tries to be about multiple topics.

That's why I think my numbers above are a good guideline.

And if you stick to such numbers, you also gain another benefit: you know how to _pace_ your chapters. You know when to make something happen or when you can spend a few more paragraphs on description. You know when you still need to build more tension and be patient (when < 1,000 words), or when you need to quickly get to an ending (when nearing 3,000 words).

Your mileage may vary. But for me, this helps add structure to the chaos of getting the story on paper. 

It also prevents chapters with _wildly_ different lengths, which I strongly dislike. Like many, I read in bed, before falling asleep. If a chapter could take me 5 minutes, or it could take me 30 minutes, that's really annoying and messes with my sleep. Same thing, of course, if you read on your commute to work.
