This course explains how to go from finishing a work to actually publishing it. It contains details about the general process, as well as advice (and warnings) when it comes to both traditional publishing and self-publishing. I personally have much more experience with self-publishing, which is why the course will mostly focus on that. 

(You can find my work under my real name, _Tiamo Pastoor_. Older work is Dutch, newer work is all English.)
