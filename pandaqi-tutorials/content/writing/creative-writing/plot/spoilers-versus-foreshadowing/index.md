Like most, I despise spoilers. Especially in more popular genres, the main draw of a story comes from _mystery_. Not knowing what's going to happen. Not knowing who's the murderer or what a mysterious message means.

If you already know the answers, then it feels useless experiencing the story again.

At the same time, writers always talk about the need to use **foreshadowing**. You need to hint at what's going to happen. You need to provide clues that _might_ lead the audience to correctly guess the solution. If you don't, the audience feels cheated and if events just happen at random.

So what's the difference? When does giving information mean _spoiling_ (a very bad thing) and when does it mean _foreshadowing_ (a very good thing)? How do you use this to craft better stories?

## Vague Knowledge

After years of doing creative projects, I created my own theory of "vague knowledge". 

(I have a better term for this in my mother tongue (Dutch), but haven't found an equally catch alternative in English. The literal translation would be "doubt knowledge".)

The idea is simple.

* You want to give the audience information. (Which is _clear_ and _true_.)
* But with a vagueness built-in. (Which opens the information up to interpretation or multiple possibilities.)

If you give people "vague knowledge", it feels like progress, without giving it all away. It's foreshadowing, not spoiling.

This is related to a saying from earlier in the course: "Give readers WHAT they expect, but not HOW they expect it."

If you foreshadow, it should be in a way that leaves multiple paths as to _how_ it plays out. If you give away the ending, there should be many interesting paths to _reach_ that ending.

If you also give away those other details---telling exactly what happens and how---you are spoiling instead.

But remember that it is vague **knowledge**. You still need to give new information, in a clear way, which is true. You can't just give information that is completely false to mislead the reader, or such vague statements that they teach nothing at all. 

Foreshadowing is knowledge, but not all of it. It's one puzzle piece, out of many.

Let's say you have a prophecy, the pinnacle of vague knowledge! It might say "The green one will kill all demons". 

This is _specific knowledge_. It doesn't just say anybody, it mentions the adjective "green". It doesn't say they will defeat evil, no it says "kill all demons".

But it's not a spoiler, as there are many interpretations and ways to fulfill it.

Classical stories often started by spoiling the end! At the start of Romeo & Juliet, it tells you that it's a tale of two lovers that ends tragically.

But it's not actually a spoiler, because this is vague knowledge. You have a vague sense of how it ends, but not HOW you get there (or any details).

If, instead, the story started with the full explanation of the ending, then _that_ would be spoiling.

I see three common ways to do this.

* Giving information double meaning (see the section below, this one is the strongest)
* Giving something that isn't clear on its own, but hints that it's part of a bigger whole. ("It will all make sense once you have all the pieces".)
* Giving something can still be changed. (One character claims X, a few chapters later another character claims Y. Then it's about figuring out who is lying and who is telling the truth.)

### The double meaning

The most effective way to accomplish this, is through a double meaning. Find information that will be interpreted _differently_ when viewed through a different _perspective_.

One character sees an event and concludes it means A. But the _real_ conclusion is B, which you only realize once another character talks about the event from their perspective.

As you practice this, it will come more naturally over time. These are very simple to implement, once you have an idea, but very effective. For a simple reason:

> If you put _multiple_ meanings into one sentence or concept, the audience cannot know which is the right one (that the story will execute)!

It's even better if you intentionally frame your whole story to lead the audience to the _wrong_ perspective on events. You have the great power to subtly influence how your audience responds to any information given to them, and you should use it well.

In the Game of Thrones books, there's this character Tyrion. He has dwarfism: as an adult, he's still the size of a child. Near the start of the first book, there's an interesting line.

_When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king._

This line has double meaning. For one, it simply describes the setting. But it also clearly labels Tyrion "as a king", which might be foreshadowing that he ends up on the Throne.

A pirate story of mine is told from the perspective of a young girl trying to reclaim a treasure stolen from her parents. 

From her perspective, treasure is clearly seen as _good_ and _worth a lot_. This allows me to sneak in many hints that the treasures actually are cursed, especially with how the other pirates talk about them, without giving away the mystery to readers.

In the eyes of the girl, the other pirates are "jealous" or trying to "keep the gold for themselves". Reinforcing the idea that treasures are full of gold and nice things!

But once I reveal the true nature of treasures, readers (hopefully) feel satisfied because this twist was clearly foreshadowed from the start.

### A matter of perspective

To summarize this: foreshadowing is almost always a matter of perspective.

* Either the perspective (that tells the information) misleads the audience.
* Or the one receiving the information is precisely the one who wouldn't understand it immediately. (For example, a non-wizard receives information about a dark magic spell. They will not realize what it means, no matter how clear the information is.)

Also note that perspective can mean the _timing_ of the story. You could start a book with the _ending_. After that first chapter, you go back to the beginning and explain "how we got there". If you write that end scene well, the reader knows how the story ends, but is interested in HOW we got there.

Purposefully _design_ your perspective to make sure all information told is foreshadowing, not spoiling.

### Example from game dev

This is from my work in game development. Vague knowledge is also a useful tool there. 

I once made a game in which you could scan your surroundings for enemies (on your turn). At first, this was a precise scan: it would tell you exactly who was where. ("An octopus at A6, a ship at B4, ...")

Seems logical, right? Well, it didn't work. The knowledge was too specific and complete. It made the game both overwhelming and too easy. Instead, I changed it to a simpler response: it tells you how _many_ enemies there are, nothing else. ("Two enemies in range of two tiles.")

Turning knowledge into vague knowledge made the game both _simpler_ and _better_. 

Hopefully you immediately see how this also works for a story. Maybe your hero has a gadget that scans the area. It's much better to make it report "one enemy nearby", than to make it report the _precise_ locations and details of each. Introduce it as a limitation of this rudimentary device. 

Now the reader can imagine the possibilities. What type of enemy? Are they close? How are they going to find them? You've given them knowledge, but instead of spoiling what happens next, you made them excited and gave them options.

## The spoiling test

To make this a little easier, I simply created a simple test for what is a "good" story (to me).

> If you spoil the ending, and people _still_ want to experience the whole story, it's a good story.

An "okay" story is usually only fun _once_. After reading or viewing it, you had a fun time, but you forget about it and move on.

A really "great" story should have more depth than that. It should have themes, complexity, characters with whom you just want to spend more time. It should have elements that mean you want to experience the story again, even if you know the ending.

So that's a good test. Write a bit at the start of your story that gives away the ending. If you'd _still_ be interested in getting the whole story, it's probably a strong one.

## Conclusion

In a sense, telling stories is like a magic trick.

_You_ carefully pick the elements you want to show the audience, projecting the idea that you're giving them a glimpse into the truth. You turn around the box to show there are no secret parts. You promise, at the start of the trick, that your lovely assistent will leave the box unharmed (and not sawed in two).

But the trick itself has to be _experienced_ by the audience. That's where the tension and sensation is. That's what it's all about. Stating what was going to happen made it _more_ exciting, not _less_.

And the real magic? The real trick? The audience didn't see it the first time, for they were distracted by all your promises about what would happen or how it would end.

And that's why they want to see the trick again, and again, because maybe next time they _do_ discover the secret behind it.
