This article talks about writing simple _action_ in general. How to write the things that _happen_, both big and small, in your book.

Next chapter proposes my rules for writing good action sequences (such as an epic battle or fight). Because writing simple actions is easy; writing longer sequences filled with action is very hard and takes practice.

## What is action?

An action is simply a sentence in which something _happens_. Sometimes this is called a "beat".

* He walked to the fridge.
* She opened the door.
* We jumped off the cliff.

In general, action has very short and clear language. Action is _fast_ and _immediate_ by nature. This does **not** mean that action should only be really short sentences, as is often advised. That would read like a broken record. No, always vary your sentence length, even in fast action.

BAD: She punched the man. He grabbed his sword. He stumbled away from here. She raised her sword. She grumbled. He yelled.

BETTER: She punched the man. He grabbed his sword, stumbling away, as she raised hers. She grumbled; he yelled.

It means that every action, every piece of a sentence, should be short and clear. Action is no time to add decoration or description to the language. Notice, in the examples, how the sentence doesn't add adverbs and doesn't go on tangents about details.

For that, you use [Description](../description/), its opposite (discussed in a few chapters). Those sentences are traditionally longer and have a slower pace.

All of this is more related to _prose_ than _plot_, hence discussed in far more detail in my [Prose](../../prose/) course!

But below is a summary.

### Combine connected actions

Put actions in the same sentence if they are _connected_. They're done by the same person, or in the same motion, or steps towards the same goal.

The reverse is also true. Do not combine actions in the same sentence (through a comma, for example) that are _not_ clearly connected. Put those into their own sentence.

* FINE: He walked to the fridge, while she opened the door and pulled her weapon.
* GOOD: He walked to the fridge. She opened the door and pulled her weapon.
* MEH: He walked to the fridge. She opened the door. She pulled her weapon.

But as always, clarity and varying sentence length comes first.

### Paragraph Spacing

Instead of making _really short sentences_ all the time, give actions (especially longer sequences) more _whitespace_.

* Keep the paragraphs shorter.
* If a new or sudden event happens, do so as a _new_ paragraph.
* The most important action should always be the first or last sentence of a paragraph.
* And if something is _really_ important, writers often make it a one-line paragraph standing on its own.

In the example below, see how the most important realization is on its own paragraph.

She ran up the stairs, panting, chasing the enemy soldier. The door to the bedroom clanged shut. No problem. She reached for it, drove her sword through the lock, and opened it.

The room was empty.

Where had he gone? The room had no windows.

This is why _thrillers_ usually have very short paragraphs and lots of whitespace around the text.

### Sensory Immersion

New writers usually only write what you can _see_. While this is a fine starting point, written stories have the amazing ability to engage the other senses.

You might not _see_ an attack coming, but you _feel_ the hit in your back.

You may not _see_ the attacker, but you _hear_ their footsteps.

You may get dizzy or off balance when you're scared. You may feel sick after doing something revolting.

Action is especially about the _senses_, more so than description. Because how do we register something that happens? We register it _through our senses_. If none of our senses pick it up, we do not know that something happened. When in "action mode", our senses become extra sensitive.

And don't just use the basic ones (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch), but _everything_ we can feel in our body or brain.

## Non-Violent Action

This is a common mistake (for beginning writers) of which I am _severely_ guilty.

The word "action" automatically evokes images of fighting. Of guns being shot, people getting wounded, of _violent_ or _physical_ threat. And yes, many stories do have such action, and it's an easy but very effective method to get tension.

But it's not the only way.

My early stories constantly had battle scenes or people getting aggressive. I didn't know any other way to add _action_. Maybe I knew, in the back of my mind, but just couldn't produce that on the page.

Instead, I want to remind you that action is _anything_ that happens. It does not need to be a fight, it does not need to be violent. In fact, as I wrote more stories, I've stopped using violence for tension almost completely.

Why? Because the violence is usually aimed at the protagonist, whom we _know_ isn't going to die at page 40. Other consequences of violence are also rarely used (such as getting handicapped permanently). It's the _least_ interesting type of action, unless it's setup well and supported by the rest of the story.

As such, I want to challenge you to write some stories with great action scenes that are _not_ about fighting.

Say you have a story in which somebody is trying to secure a deal. The deal would give them huge power, or money, or whatever thing they always wanted. They present the contract after much work ... and the other person _rips it apart_. Such an action is just as shocking and decisive as physical attack.

Or maybe it's even smaller than that. Somebody has dreamt of being a writer for years and has finally written that novel. They wrote the email (to a potential publisher, or maybe a writing contest), but are just too scared to press the button. Actually overcoming that fear and _pressing_ a button, would then be a huge action in your story.
