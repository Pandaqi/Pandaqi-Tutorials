This course is all about how to _plot_ a story. How to pick events, situations and conflicts that will bring out the best from your characters and setting. If you're just starting out, first read my general course on [Storytelling](../storytelling/). It links to _this_ more specific course whenever needed.

I am a professional author under my real name: _Tiamo Pastoor_. While that's no proof of expertise, hopefully it convinces you to give my course a try! As always, I aim to be practical, fun and efficient when teaching.
