This is another plotting tool I invented, after writing several stories that were _just_ not good enough and that received feedback from professional editors.

I have a hyperactive brain. This causes me to put _way too much_ into my stories. I usually had multiple storylines, each chapter following a different one, which come together near the end. 

When I first received feedback about this, I was taken aback. I knew _plenty_ stories that were far more complicated, which had far more going on, but were _not_ deemed "too complicated" or "overwhelming". What was the difference?

The answer, so I've learned, is **focus**.

## What does it mean?

Instead of switching between completely different storylines, stay _focused_ on one storyline for a longer period. A chapter, multiple chapters, maybe a whole section of the book. Once you're done with it, _switch the focus_ (in its entirety) to the other storyline.

When plotting, try to _group_ related events or concepts into the same chapter. Invent a way to allow every chapter to _focus_ completely on one aspect of your character, setting or plot. Once chapters start to focus on multiple things at a time, you've lost the reader. (Even if each thing, on its own, is quite simple and easy to understand.)

This all combines into what I call the **focus shift**. To keep a complex story easy to follow, 

* Stay focused on the same general concept for a longer period of time
* And once you're done with it, _shift_ to a new focus entirely.

In practice, this means you'll have at most a handful of focus shifts, even for very long (fantasy) novels.

{{% example %}}
You have two storylines. One takes place at location A, the other at location B a great distance away. In earlier stories, I'd do a quick chapter at A, then a quick chapter at B, then one at A again, and so forth until the end. 

With this approach, you'd _stay_ at location A for a longer time. For multiple chapters, you experience the height of the action there and the most important events are _shown_. Then, you shift entirely to location B. For multiple chapters, you are focused entirely on the other location.

It will take some practice to find if you _need_ to do this shift, and _when_ you want to do it. But once I realized this, my stories became far easier to follow, and I noticed this in other popular novels.

For example, I know several fantasy novels that _do_ switch constantly between story A and story B (after each chapter). However, if a MAJOR event happens at A, they _stay_ at A for a few chapters. It's a simple timing thing that makes a story much easier to follow. (Additionally, if you have really long chapters, you already have proper focus and can switch after each chapter.)

## The midpoint twist

This is a related idea that I've found equally powerful.

The middle of a story is the place that often gets _muddled_ and _lacking direction_. It's often dubbed the "muddy middle" or a "sagging middle". To combat this, most popular stories use a simple trick: the midpoint twist.

> Exactly halfway your story, place a MAJOR event that completely changes the trajectory of the story.

As with any event, it should be _set up_. It shouldn't come out of left field or feel random. Nor should it be the most climactic event of your story: afterwards, action should still be rising, towards your actual climax near the end.

But it's a big twist. Something that breaks the story in two pieces. And those two pieces should be related, but significantly _different_.

Once I learned this, I have _always_ planned a midpoint twist in all my stories. And it has worked every time.

And _how_ do you plot a midpoint twist? Well, by using a focus shift! 

* Up until now, the hero has been pursuing a certain goal, focused on that.
* The midpoint twist should turn that upside-down, giving the hero a slightly _altered_ goal to focus on from now on!

Often, this is accompanied by that literal focus shift I explained above: something major happens at the midpoint, creating an interesting cliffhanger ... and then we cut away, continuing the story focused on something else.

### Example: Saga of Life

One of my ongoing projects is the Saga of Life. I aim to write 10 short stories for it every year. Each of them has exactly 10 chapters, and I apply the midpoint twist around chapter 5 and 6.

One story, for example, is about farm animals who are treated badly and aim to escape the farm. The first chapters build towards that escape attempt (setting it up, planning, ...). When do they attempt the escape? You guessed it: chapter 5.

They fail. That has consequences: the daughter of the farm owner now knows what they're doing. So, from now on, the focus has changed slightly. They still want to escape, but the rules have changed and completely different obstacles are in play. (Some animals think the daughter will help and think she's an essential part of the plan, others have a deep distrust towards _humans_ and don't want any of this.)

Now imagine that story _without_ the midpoint twist. What would be happening around chapter 5 and 6? The animals would ... still be looking for a way to escape. The reader has now been reading about animals _planning_ to do something for 6 chapters, and nothing has happened yet! Once they actually escape, near the end, it won't feel satisfying. It would feel like the predictable ending that should've come much sooner.

Hence the "saggy middle" that feels boring and lacking focus. Use the midpoint twist to hook the reader back into the story, before they start to drift off.

## Now write!

Pick an idea that has multiple storylines (or multiple clearly separated locations/concepts/mysteries). Now write that story, keeping in mind the focus shift and the midpoint twist.

* Design your plot so that chapters can focus entirely on one thing.
* When something important (or complex) happens at a storyline, stay focused on it for a little longer, and only _then_ completely shift focus to another storyline.
* Around the midpoint of your story, place a HUGE event that shakes up the hero's world. An event that breaks the story in two parts (before the midpoint and after the midpoint) which feel clearly different.

This challenge is especially useful if you write longer (fantasy) novels, or have the tendency to overcomplicate stories (like me).
