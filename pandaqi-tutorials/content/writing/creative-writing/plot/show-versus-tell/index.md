Okay, so you have a plot. You have some events and information to get across. You need to communicate these to the reader, _write it down_ in some way. Then you have two options, broadly speaking.

You can **tell** it literally. Your hero defeated a monster? Just say "The hero defeated the monster!" and now the reader knows.

Or you can **show** it through more plot. You write a whole scene in which the hero approaches the monster, fights it, then defeats it. You've given the same plot, just in a different way and with more details.

This is a skill that takes many books to master, and even then there's no definitive answer. When do you _show_? When do you _tell_? How do you _convert_ a piece of information into a full scene that shows it?

This chapter gives more examples and practical tips on how to turn your plot ideas into scenes, chapters and paragraphs on the page.

## Three Layers of Writing

In my opinion, there are actually three layers of writing.

* **Tell**: you literally state the information
* **Show**: you construct plot (a scene, an action, dialogue) that _shows_ the information
* **Feel**: you use multiple steps (actions, paragraphs, scenes) to make the reader _feel_ the emotion of the character

These are ranked based on how much space they need (and how hard they are to pull off). Telling is incredibly short and efficient. To truly make a reader _feel_ needs time and setup. 

Feeling needs both showing and telling, repeatedly, over a longer period of time. If your hero suffers a single injustice, the reader won't care yet. If your hero suffers an injustice, but you explain it with a single sentence and then continue, the reader won't care.

If the reader is _shown_ injustice after injustice, in different ways, and constantly _told_ extra information that makes these events even worse---that's when the reader will really _feel_ the emotions of our hero.

Some people call this "Explain" (Tell) vs "Experience" (Show). Use those terms, if they work better for you.

## When to use which?

This is my rule.

> The more _important_ or _emotional_ an event is, the more space it should take up in your story.

In other words, a minor bit of information can be _told_ in one sentence. Important plot beats should be _shown_. The climax of the story should surely be _felt_ by the reader. 

Think about what I taught you in the [Progress](../progress/) chapter, about the "points on a map" strategy. Those "major events" on a character's route should surely be _shown_. You should write a whole scene in which the event plays out, instead of telling what happened directly to the reader.

In every scene, though, details exist that are important to know, but not important enough to be shown. Maybe the clothes people wear, or their surroundings. If those details are only mentioned so the reader can imagine the setting, just _tell_ them: "He wore a brown jacket." or "The room had grey walls covered in abstract paintings." (If that jacket, for some reason, has huge value in your story, spend more time on it.)

Maybe somebody looks tired. You can _show_ somebody is tired through their dialogue and actions, but that would take several paragraphs. Is it really that important? Probably not, so simply say "Sarah looked tired."

In summary,

* Make the reader _feel_ the biggest turning points of the story (such as the climax). This means you take enough time to setup and payoff this emotion, by showing (in detail) what led up to it, but also the consequences.
* Write a whole _scene_ for every important development in the plot, every bit of Progress. (Each scene should have a purpose. _Show_ that purpose.)
* Literally tell everything else. 

## Examples

### Example: event

Events are easier to show. Even beginning writers naturally know they want a whole _scene_ for the event, not just one line that states it happened. (Although events that aren't crucial to the current plot, such as a bit of backstory or history, should just be told.)

{{% example %}}
TELL: He found the document and stole it.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
SHOW: He opened the top drawer. Nothing. He opened the next drawer and a paper with coffee stains caught his attention. This had to be the document, right? Footsteps in the adjacent room forced him to act quick. He grabbed the paper, stuffed it in his bag, and opened the window to flee.
{{% /example %}}

### Example: information

Information---such as feelings, character traits, details needed for a mystery---are harder to do. You will mainly _tell_ these, but the most important ones should still be shown. You will have to _design_ a scene that conveys this information without literally saying it.

{{% example %}}
TELL: He realized James was his father.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
SHOW: Picture frames were placed around the room like trophies. He started---they were pictures of _him_ as a baby. How? Why? Why did James, his teacher from elementary school long ago, keep pictures of him? He grabbed the first frame and inspected it more closely. The frame was weathered, the photo the original, not copied. He grabbed the second frame.

James stood behind him and held him high in the air, like that scene from the Lion King, like ... like ... he was his son.

## Use the layers for hierarchy

Thinking about these layers is _great_ for structuring your story. It gives you a hierarchy that tells you which events are most important to your story, and which are less crucial.

If you cannot clearly separate parts of your plot (into what should be felt, shown or told), the plot is probably too complicated or messy. Maybe you tried to do too much and made every event feel like the end of the world. Or maybe you did too little, and the story meanders endlessly between not-really-important events and breadcrumbs.

Stories, like most art, need _contrast_. Your climax will only feel impactful if everything that came before it was less impactful. You can't have the highs without the lows. Stories need a variation between fast-paced action, and slower-paced scenes. An ebb and flow of crucial events and less important events. 

Give readers a scene that takes their breath away---then give them some time to breathe!

## How (not) to show

Given the advice "show, don't tell", many writers start to show _everything_. Instead of writing "Sarah was angry", they invent all sorts of sentences that _show_ she is angry. "Sarah clenched her fists" and "Sarah turned red" and "Sarah shouted at the top of her lungs".

This isn't wrong perse. If Sarah's anger is important, yeah, show it. Reveal it through her body language, tone of voice, word choice.

The problem is that this isn't really showing. This is just saying "Sarah is angry" in a very convoluted way. You require multiple sentences of body language just to state that simple fact.

When showing, make it **specific** and **unique**. Anger comes in many forms. How a person reveals this anger, says a lot about their character. When showing, find a way to reveal the _precise_ anger that Sarah exudes.

If the specifics don't matter, well, **don't show, just tell!** 

If the specifics _do_ matter, that's when you show, and you do it in the most fitting way possible.

### An example

Let's say Sarah just had a stressful day and it's quite a logical consequence that she's a bit angry. Then simply _tell_ the reader Sarah is angry, one or two times, in simple ways. Confirm the story so far, confirm what the reader expects, but swiftly continue.

If her anger comes after a _huge_ betrayal, and you want the reader to fear for what Sarah does next, _show it_. Find unique traits of Sarah that reveal just how angry she is. Maybe she never swears, in the whole story, but now she _does_. Maybe she cares a lot about fashion and clothes, but now she _rips_ her shirt in two, adding to her anger even more!

### Another example

Let's say your story revolves a lot around mystery and figuring out clues. There are _many_ ways to deliver this information to readers.

If it's a minor clue, or a _subtle_ hint, just tell it. Drop the information somewhere, like it's nothing, and move on.

If it's slightly more important, spend a little more time on it. Maybe the information comes through in a dialogue, after pressing. Maybe they find the clue in some old book. This takes some paragraphs to set up, but that's not too bad.

If it's a big reveal, however, write a whole chapter around it, maybe a whole storyline. Hide the information in some remote location, so the hero needs to travel there. Hide the information with a character who has a strong reason _not_ to share it. Split the information into two pieces, and the hero needs to figure out how the two work together. 

Make the hero work. Reveal this information through _showing_ it.

A common mistake is to be inconsistent with this. Many mystery-type stories will spend a whole scene just for a minor clue, and then drop a _huge_ clue in a single sentence somewhere. (Like, an adventurer travels a long way to visit a temple, fight enemies, extract some artefact ... and it _barely_ progresses the mystery. The next scene, their companion makes some offhanded comment and it's THE clue that solves all!) 

Or, they'll never consider that you can _show_ information. So they basically _tell_ all the clues through description or very on-the-nose dialogue.

Every bit of plot can be told or shown. Pick the right one for how important it is. Be consistent with this, as it's a clear signal that helps the reader understand your plot more easily.

## Conclusion

Hopefully this gives a sense of how to execute the details of your plot. 

* Pick the most important information you want to get across. Design a plot to _show_ this information.
* Now that you have your most important plot pieces, turn those into your scenes or chapters.
* Weave less important events into those scenes, maybe by showing, maybe by telling the information directly.
* Reveal information about characters by the specifics of how they act and talk. Only do this if it's important enough, and do it in a way that is specific and unique. Otherwise, just state the information literally.
* Tell the non-essential details, don't spend whole paragraphs or scenes showing them.

Finally, pick one emotion or theme that is absolutely the _core_ of your story, and make sure the reader _feels_ it. That can only happen if you show it, multiple times, in different ways, throughout the whole story.
