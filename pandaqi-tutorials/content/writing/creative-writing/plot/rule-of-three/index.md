Previous chapter already set up this chapter. I mentioned how stories typically _threaten_ death once or twice before actually going through with it. In other words ... a conflict arises 3 times!

> An event occurs 3 times, but in slightly different ways. The third time's the charm: that one actually triggers change or a new event.

That's the rule of three. It's common in all stories, but especially fairy tales and folklore. Think of _Goldilocks_ or _Three Little Pigs_. Why? Because it works so well. It allows setup and payoff in the most efficient way possible. It allows repeating a conflict (to set it up), but while adding _variation_.

## The Four Implementations

There are four ways to express this.

* **Cumulative Three** (or "simple three"): the event happens three times, simply because it is something that would happen regularly. (Take Cinderella: she has three visits to the ball, because the elite are regularly having a ball!)
* **Ascending Three**: each event is more significant than the previous. (For example, the hero first wins a bronze medal, then a silver, and finally the gold medal.)
* **Contrasting Three**: the first two events are negative, and only the third has positive value. (Take Three Little Pigs: the first two houses are blown down by the wolf, and only the third stays upright.)
* **Dialectical Three**: the first event is wrong in one extreme, the second event wrong in the other extreme, and the third is "just right". (Take Goldilocks: the first bed is too stiff, the second too soft, but the third in which she sleeps is just right.)

## Now write!

Write a story in which everything follows the rule of three. Vary your implementations of it, to keep it fresh and prevent it from becoming predictable.

Notice the power of this technique.

* The first two events allow setup, giving information, building threat, promising the reader where it's going.
* The third event actually pulls the trigger and delivers satisfying payoff from all this buildup

This only works if the rule of three is focused on one thing. Focus just keeps coming back in this course! Don't apply it to multiple things at the same time. It gets messy and confusing, as you basically turn it into a less effective Rule of Six. (Well, you're free to _try_ and see for yourself, I always encourage that!)
