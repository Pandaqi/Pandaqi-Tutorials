We've talked about how to write action and how to write description. When it came to action, the action needed to have an emotional foundation, otherwise the reader didn't care. When it came to description, it needed to be told through an emotional lens to prevent feeling like a detour.

But _how_ do you write emotion? What separates an emotional scene from one that just feels superficial or melodramatic?

## How to write one

This harkens back to our chapter about [Show versus Tell](../show-versus-tell/). It introduced a third layer of writing, which I call **Feel**, which should be used for the most emotional moments.

Most importantly, it states that you should

* Mix showing and telling
* But do it over a longer period of time, building to a climax throughout the whole story.

An emotional scene _never_ stands on its own. No matter your choice of words, no matter your quality of writing, without proper setup and time spent with the characters, no scene will have an emotional impact. 

If your hero's father dies on page 1, it's hard to care. We don't know anything about these characters or their world. In fact, a nice "twist" opening would be to reveal on page 3 that the hero absolutely hated their father and is glad they're gone. A first chapter can play and jumble emotions, as there's no setup yet that gives the reader strong feelings about parts of the story.

This brings me to my three rules.

## Mix showing and telling

If you only _tell_, the scene feels very superficial and bland. "I was so sad. Man, very sad, extremely sad. Did I tell you how sad I was?"

If you only _show_, the scene will be drawn out and feel melodramatic. "Tears stream down my face, many tears, endless tears, that just keep on coming, as my face reddens and my body starts shivering, and I'm now just writing anything _but_ my literal emotion."

Why? Because something feels melodramatic if ... 

* You spent way too long on the same emotion or message. (Going past conveying the feeling, into overstaying your welcome and frustrating the audience.)
* There is no **contrast**: if everyone is crying their eyes out all the time, then it loses its meaning.

This is surely a thing that comes with practice. Read a lot of stories, write a lot of stories. Find that balance.

But as always, the general idea is to structure the emotion like a mini-story. At first, start out by telling. The emotional impact is low. As time goes on, and the emotion deepens, switch to showing. Build up to the _climax_ of the emotion, the biggest moment in which you really want the audience to _feel_ it.

If the emotion is at maximum level since the start, showing everything, then the contrast is missing and it feels melodramatic.

## Earn it

Similarly, a common response to emotional scenes (which you do not want) is "What? She's completely overreacting. Why is she being so dramatic?!"

This happens when you haven't _earned it_.

There was no proper setup or buildup. You didn't spend the time and effort to _really_ convey why a person is sad, or angry, or disgusted, or jealous, or whatever. So when you write a scene in which it all comes out, in one emotional outburst, it feels like overreacting. ("She offends you _once_ and you burn her house down!?")

Again, think in terms of _arcs_, mini-stories and rising tension. Setup and payoff. There should be many scenes _before_ the big emotional one that set it up and give hints about what's to come.

## Be specific

Now you might wonder: but _how_ to show the emotion? Telling is easy. Just write: "Sarah was angry." But how do you show it?

* Through actions, mostly body language and dialogue. ("He raised his voice.")
* Through introspection. You should select viewpoint characters that will have the biggest emotional moments in the story, precisely so you can write those moments from _their perspective_. When inside their head, you can really show their thoughts and emotions.

INTROSPECTION: "She thought of all the times she played hide and seek with her father. How he'd pretend not to see her, pretend to search for half an hour, just so she could have her fun. It was unfair. Unfair! Why had the gods decided to kill the one person that matter to her?"

If you can do this, you're already 90% of the way to success. But there's a last step. Many writers learn the same "standard phrases" to show an emotion, such as "clenching fists" when angry or "raising your voice". They repeat these phrases over, and over, and over, every time. Because they were taught to _show_ and these phrases do that!

It's also repetitive, grating and not as effective as it could be. 

Instead, find _specific_ and _unique_ ways to show emotion. You can be angry in many different _ways_ for many different _reasons_. Your story should have a more specific reason for the angry outburst, and it should show in your writing.

A very calm person will have a controlled anger. They do not clench their fists or raise their voice. Instead, they might speak in veiled threats, or do absolutely nothing until they suddenly leap into an attack.

Maybe your hero has a necklace that means a lot to her. (Maybe it's from her mother, who died long ago, or something in that vein.) When she's sad, she doesn't cry or think about how unfair the world is. She simply sits down and touches the necklace and plays with it. That's a unique and fitting way for _that_ character to show emotion.
