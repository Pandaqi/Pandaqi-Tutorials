Previous chapter gave you an idea of how to get _scenes_ or _chapters_ out of your plot. How to know which parts you should show, and which you should just tell with a literal sentence.

Let's take one final step into the _specifics_ of a scene. Okay, you want to make something happen. Maybe a character trait is revealed, maybe somebody needs to attack another, _something_ is supposed to happen in your scene.

How do you construct the scene?

* Like a mini-story. Add a promise at the start, progress in between, then payoff. You already know how to do this!
* By applying the two core tenets of storytelling in general: **goal** and **obstacle**. Together, they create **conflict**.

Maybe you're surprised that goals, obstacles and conflict are only mentioned this late into the course. I would like to remind you that this is only a _plot_ course. Goals and Obstacles are tied to _character_ and sometimes _setting_. I still recommend reading the [Storytelling](../../storytelling/) course first, which handles the art of telling a story _globally_ (from beginning to end), and immediately dives into ideas such as _conflict_.

This chapter provides a summary of why conflict matters and how to get it. It also adds some practical tips on how to improve it.

## What's the idea?

In every scene, a character should _want_ something (the "goal") and something else should _stand in the way_ (the "obstacle"). This creates conflict.

Throughout the scene, we see if and how this conflict is resolved.

As such, in general, a scene would be structured as follows.

* **Start**: promise the conflict, by introducing the goal and then the obstacle.
* **Middle**: the characters try to solve the conflict or work through it.
* **End**: something happens that resolves the conflict. Maybe they reach the goal, maybe they lose. Maybe the conflict is temporarily solved, but the chapter ends with a cliffhanger that reveals some bad _consequence_.

This "goal" and "obstacle" don't need to be grandiose. No, leave that for the _whole_ story. On a scene-by-scene basis, characters have simple goals and simple direct obstacles. Sometimes they lose, sometimes they win, but they always make progress.

{{% example %}}
Maybe a character is on a quest to find a certain magical sword. In a given scene, their goal would simply be "visit the tavern and ask around for information". Then you could invent an obstacle, such as the character being _wanted_ and someone in the tavern recognizing them. Or you hint that they clearly know about the sword, but for some reason nobody in the tavern wants to _tell_ it. 

Ta da, now you have a scene that can play out in interesting ways. The reader clearly knows what happens and why, and they want to see if the hero succeeds in getting that info or not.

You can go even simpler. Maybe a _group_ of characters is on this quest. A new one is added, and the hero is immediately (romantically) interested. So they have a simple goal "talk to the new one, get to know them". An obstacle could be the fact that the hero is shy and doesn't know how to begin. That's also a valid scene with conflict.
{{% /example %}}

Even so, a scene _without_ conflict is not a scene. There has to be some goal and some obstacle (that prevents them from instantly, without effort, reaching the goal). 

Otherwise, what's the purpose of the scene? You could've _told_ us that the hero achieved the goal in one sentence. But you decide to _show_ it, with a scene, so there has to be juicy conflict.

## Good Conflict

Now, not all conflict is created equal. Conflict is **not** the same as "problem" or "issue". 

You could write a story in which the main characters just _argue_ every chapter, getting angry over disagreements, naming all the issues they're having. Obviously, that's not a good story, and that's not "good" conflict.

Or one in which your hero has trouble deciding what to eat for dinner. Yeah, that's a "problem" they need to solve. But it's not really compelling conflict, is it?

Or one in which some great magical evil is coming ... in about a hundred years. Yeah, a big problem is coming, but that would be one boring novel as we just _wait_ for it.

There is clearly "good" conflict (in terms of storytelling) and "bad" conflict.

But how do we differentiate these? Are there any rules or guidelines? I've found it surprisingly hard to find specific advice on this. Many people just give _examples_ of conflict they like or don't like in popular media, emitting a vibe of "you know it when you see it".

Below is _my_ method for checking if my conflict is sound. It has greatly improved the quality of my stories, but I'm in no way suggesting it's _the_ answer.

A good conflict ...

* Comes from **a clash of relevant goals**
* Is **urgent** or immediate.
* Has the potential for **loss**
* Leads to **progress** or consequences.

Let's dissect that.

* Conflict starts with somebody who has a goal and who hits an obstacle. That's the definition. But it should be an important, relevant goal. They should _really_ want that, for good reasons. Ideally, it's related to the Promise and Progress.
* They have to act _now_. It is relevant _now_. Otherwise, doing nothing is an option, and it's often a good one that characters would take, which means your story grinds to a halt.
* If they _don't_ act, they will _lose_ something. Humans are risk averse. Fear of losing something is much stronger than potential of gaining something.
* _Whatever_ the outcome of the conflict, it progresses the story. Win or loss, both have interesting consequences.

Why a "clash" of goals? Because I've noticed that the strongest conflict is between two characters (with their own goals). Yes, obstacles can also be random or inanimate (like a natural disaster), but that's just less interesting.

This feels like cheating: "The hero wants to cross the bridge, but OH NO, a rainstorm suddenly appears and destroys it!"

Another character purposely _destroying_ the bridge to stop the hero feels like a nice scene.

For more examples and details on good and bad conflict, visit the [Definition of Story](../../storytelling/the-definition-of-story/) chapter (from the Storytelling course). It's a great practical overview of the core ingredients needed for a story.

### Internal vs External conflict

Most stories benefit from two main conflicts, one _internal_ and one _external_. 

The first is a conflict that comes from the hero's personality and character. They fight against their past, their demons, their fears, something _within_ themselves.

The other is a conflict with some external, outside force.

Both conflicts influence each other. Maybe the hero butts heads with somebody else _because_ of their inner conflict. Maybe a great loss, suffered at the hands of their enemy, _causes_ them to doubt themselves and increase their inner conflict.

This weaving of conflicts keeps the story fresh at all times. It also allows you to create amazing stories (using the external conflict, which is easier to plot) that still include some lesson for the hero to learn or some deeper meaning (using the inner conflict).

### Rising Action

Finally, a common mistake is to randomly pick the _severity_ of your conflict. Maybe you invent some crazy conflict in each scene that threatens the hero's life, every time! Or you invent tiny conflicts that really don't matter that much for twenty chapters in a row.

As expected, this isn't great. It confuses readers about what's happening or where they're going. They get whiplash from how the plot sometimes seems to go super fast, then super slow.

Stories need **rising action**. The first conflict is small (although it might not feel that way, at the time). The next conflict is slightly more serious. The next one even more serious. This continues and continues, until the _final_ conflict (of the climax) is the _biggest_ of them all!

This sounds simple in theory, but is a skill only learned through experience. There are no rules here. You need to get creative and construct plots that naturally lead to higher and higher stakes.

This is partly why I'm a pantser. I start with a conflict that is rather self-contained, but interesting enough to start a book. 

As I write, I simply ask myself, every chapter: "What's a consequence of the previous scene, that has slightly more conflict?" Then I write that consequence. This way, I figure out the rising action as I go, challenging myself to find creative ways to continue every day. In a sense, I fight the obstacles at the same time as my characters.

That, to me, is the joy of storytelling. Knowing exactly how the story goes beforehand, by outlining or meticulous planning, would ruin that for me.

I remember this through the rule of: **don't just regurgitate arguments**.

Many, many stories think of a conflict and then _repeat_ it time and time again without any change. The same argument or disagreement, the same "almost escalation", repeated over and over again. Often, the writers themselves notice this and state it! I've read several books that state "We rechewed the same arguments" or "Here we go again".

Don't do this. You never want to repeat the same argument or conflict twice in a story, let alone 3+ times. At that point, it just becomes grating and frustrating. Your story isn't _leading_ anywhere, it's just stating the same conflict over and over.

If you repeat a conflict, have it _grow_ over time. The next time the disagreement is mentioned, make sure something has changed (the reasons, the location, the stakes, the people involved, whatever).

## Threat trumps Action

This is a deeper truth I was surprised to learn after writing many stories.

> The _threat_ of an event is often more powerful than the _event itself_.

In other words, most conflict comes from the _fear_ of something happening. The fear of losing something or someone. The fear of getting attacked. The fear of being left behind. The fear of not being able to persuade someone else.

The actual _event_ is more like the payoff. You've build all this tension, all this threat, and now you _release_ it by actually making something happen. The event is usually much shorter and takes less time than the conflicts that build it up.

For example, an attack is simply "He hit the guard in the face" or "She thrust the blade through his heart". One sentence. Maybe you can turn it into a longer action sequence, but for what purpose?

Most of the scene should be the _buildup_ to that action. A rising tension, a rising conflict.

For example, maybe our hero was talking to the guard at first. He just wanted passage, and did not want to resort to violence. He tries several tactics: bribing, sweet-talking, etcetera. As the conversation continues, however, it becomes clear that the guard will not let him through. So far, we've been building a conflict for multiple pages. So tense! The reader reads faster and faster, eager to see how this turns out!

And then our hero is done with it and sees no other option: they attack the guard. Maybe just a paragraph, a sentence or two, and the guard is down.

Ah, the reader can release all the tension. The hero has gained passage, progress was made, the chapter ends.

That's my biggest tip. Many writers see conflict as a physical fight, or literal death. It is not. Most conflict is merely the _threat_ of something terrible happening. Death would be the payoff and the resolution of that (temporary) conflict.

Notice, again, how this conflict comes from a terribly simple goal and a simple obstacle. The hero wants passage. The guard is the obstacle, instructed to stop anyone. Conflict, a scene, payoff and progress.

Obviously, you still need the action. Otherwise it's only promise and progress (the building threat), and no payoff! But don't think every page or scene needs some decisive action that changes everything. Most of the time is spent building up to that action, so it really counts when it happens.

## Conclusion

Phew, this was a long chapter. But that's alright, because conflict is the _essence_ of story. Knowing how to write a good one (versus a bad one, or none at all) is essential to writing a good story. It also gives you the final, practical tools for how to construct every scene.

Now you know all the general advice about plotting. Both high-level (plot is just a chain of event and consequence) and low-level (how to pick which scenes to tell and how to write them).

It's finally time to start experimenting! In the next chapters, I will present you one "tool" or "method" for generating a plot. Something I learned somewhere else, or something I invented myself over the years. Then I ask you to write one story using that method! (Ignoring any other rules. Just focus on that one method. Also, keep the stories very short, otherwise this becomes unmanageable!)

Based on everything I know about both writing and learning, this is by far the best method.

* You get a lot of practice (writing)
* But also new challenges each time (using a new method), forcing you to grow and not get stuck in bad habits or limited ideas
* And when you're done, you'll have so many tools, that you intuitively know how to approach _any_ idea you might have

So let's get started!

As mentioned before, the Storytelling course provides highly specific formulas for plotting, such as the famous 3 Act Structure. Start from the [Narrative Structure](../../storytelling/narrative-structure/) chapter and continue from there. This course merely gives (more general) **plotting tools**.

I recommend reading the chapters in order. But you can, of course, skip chapters with challenges you don't like or only pick the handful that interest you.
