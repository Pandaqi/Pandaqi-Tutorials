As mentioned in the previous chapter, every storyline starts with a **promise**. You promise the reader what it's going to be like. But what is it exactly? How do you construct a good promise? You obviously don't want to give away too much and spoil the story.

## A good promise

A strong promise usually includes the following elements.

* **Tone**: is it generally happy or dark? Is it funny or serious? Is there a clear _voice_ narrating the story?
* **Theme**: what kinds of conflict or goals will be at the center of this story? (If your first chapter introduces somebody eager to travel the world, and the rest of the story takes place at one and the same location ... that's going to feel unsatisfying.)
* **Character (Arc)**: introduce your hero and _hint_ towards what might be missing in their life or how they might change. (Not fully, not detailed, but a small hint. People read it and subconsciously think "hmm, I hope this character learns to salvage their relationship with their parents". If the book delivers _that_, it feels really good.)
* **Plot (Type)**: plots can be categorized in general types. (For example, everybody knows what a "detective story" is. If your book is a murder mystery, clearly signal that in the first few paragraphs! This way, readers know what they're in for.)

You will make these promises whether you want to or not. So it's better to take control and make promises on purpose.

Promises are _not_ the place where you break rules or try to be "surprising". In fact, err on the side of being predictable, as it makes the promise easier to understand and execute.

The novel called "They Both Die At The End" would have sucked if they did **not** both die at the end. No matter how "cool" or "surprising" you might initially think that would be.

As mentioned, most plots have already been done. So, where would you get a new promise? Where would you get new story ideas? A good way to generate a promise is to ...

* Either take a new spin on a familiar idea
* Or mash two familiar ideas together

And you don't need to be coy about it. If you're inspired by heist movies, clearly promise a heist story in your first chapter, using all the tropes and genre trappings available. But also invent one _twist_, one reason you're telling this _new_ heist story, and clearly signal _that_ as soon as possible.

## The broken heart promise

This is the most common issue for beginning writers. The thought process is understandable.

* What if I write a book that mixes genres A and B?
* They write _half_ the book as genre A.
* And the other _half_ as genre B.

For example: what if I write a detective ... that's also a romance!?

Promises are always made in the first chapter(s). As such, every reader picking up the book, assumes this to be a detective. When it turns into a romance, they'll be disappointed and most likely stop reading. (Conversely, those who enjoy romance will never pick up the book, because the first chapter clearly promises a detective.)

I call that the Broken Heart Promise. It breaks one story into two stories that should've been separate books. (It also often happens when the writer doubts themselves halfway, or gets bored, and pivots the story into a new direction.)

**Don't do this!** If you mash multiple genres or ideas, promise _all_ of them (a tiny bit) in the first chapter. If that is too much, your idea is too complicated and you need to cut something.

In general, with stories, it's better to _focus_. To pick one theme, one premise, one genre, and commit fully to that. Any reader who sees that and thinks they might like it, will _love_ your book. Any reader who would not enjoy your story anyway, will not pick up the book, as you've clearly communicated what it is (and what it's not).

## Foreshadowing

Many writers call this "promise" or this "setup" (which gets a payoff later!) **foreshadowing**. Good foreshadowing is essential to a satisfying story.

Think of it this way. There might be some evil person standing behind you this very moment, but you wouldn't know. They cast a shadow, but it's behind them, so you have no clue of the bad things that are about to befall you. When they attack, it is sudden, and you could not have prepared in any way.

Now imagine the reverse. The evil person stands behind you, but they cast a shadow _in front of them_. You see the shadow first, _then_ the evil person. This leads to a much more interesting scene, because now you build tension (you see the shadow, you slowly follow it, getting closer and closer to the intruder) and you give the reader a taste of what's about to happen. If you're smart or quick, you might still run away or defend yourself.

Without foreshadowing, many scenes feel meaningless and random. There were no hints for the hero (or the reader), nothing that might have helped them prepare to fight obstacles. With it, stories get clear meaning and purpose, which is what people seek.

It's similar to a quote from Hitchcock.

Imagine a scene with two people talking in a restaurant. They just talk about their day, make some jokes, catch up---until suddenly a bomb goes off! Yes, it's a shock, but the whole scene before that was boring and did not do anything useful. You didn't know about the bomb and neither did the characters.

Now imagine _showing_ the audience that there's a bomb under the table. (Or somebody subtly revealing there might be a bomb through dialogue.) You foreshadow that something is about to blow up. As the people make small talk, you're already growing tense. Check under the table! Why don't you look? Why don't they talk about something more important? Are they going to stop the bomb in time?!

An otherwise boring conversation, suddenly becomes interesting and exciting because you _foreshadowed_.

## Inciting Incident

The inciting incident kicks off your story. As such, the promises you make will always be strongly connected to this incident.

I think this is another true skill of the writer: coming up with the best possible inciting incident. You have to design a single event that _promises all the right things_! Come up with a good one, and readers are hooked (and the story much easier to write from now on). Come up with a bad one, and your whole plot fights against it.

{{% remark %}}
Many writers state that they always leave their first chapters for last. Maybe they write something, but they know they're going to scrap that and rewrite the first chapter at the end. Because now that they've written the whole story, they know what they should _promise_ at the start!
{{% /remark %}}

My best definition of this event is ...

> An inciting incident should **interrupt** the current situation. (This interruption prompts the _reaction_ that starts the plot cycle I explained earlier.)

Your first chapter has to start with _a_ situation. Usually the daily life of the hero, the current "status quo". This is a given: the reader knows nothing of your world, so you _have_ to start somewhere by explaining the current state of the world.

But remember the promises. You have to promise a character _arc_. A _plot_ type, and plot moves forward (using that cycle of action and reaction). So you need CHANGE!

The inciting incident should be that change. It should interrupt your explanation of the current situation, and promise the reader what kind of change will happen in this story.

{{% example %}}
Many writers use the inciting incident as just a "shocking" or "mysterious" event. While that often works to hook the reader, it falls flat quickly, as you made the wrong promises. 

If you start the book with a murder, it surely interrupts the status quo, and promises a story of death, intrigue, danger. If nobody else dies, and the change in the story is about the hero learning to overcome their own insecurity, you've promised the wrong thing. 

The inciting incident should be strongly related to the change and payoff of the whole story.

## You can do anything

Beginning writers often ask if something "can be done" or "will work". They explain their story idea, which they're very excited about and is very unique, but worry if it's just impossible to execute.

The answer is simple.

> You can do **anything**, as long as you **set it up**

As long as you promised you were going to do it, you can do it (in your story). As long as you clearly signaled this might happen, and set up the pieces for it, you can pull the trigger later.

{{% example %}}
Same with music. A note is only "wrong" if it doesn't fit with all the other notes. Change the key, and the note is suddenly right. 

The best and most memorable melodies in the world play lots of "wrong" notes. Why do they work? They lead the reader towards them, by using an intermediate chord, or introducing notes from the other scale at earlier moments.
