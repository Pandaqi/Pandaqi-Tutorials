This is probably the hardest balance to strike. If your story is too simple, it feels boring and meaningless. If your story is too complicated, people literally don't understand it and will stop caring. You want the middle ground: a story that is _compelling_, but not _complicated_.

For me, this certainly remains the biggest struggle. I have a hyperactive brain that wants to always put _more_ interesting stuff into a project! So I wrote stories with 5+ viewpoint characters, stories with 10 pirates that were all important, and so on. Yes, with practice and tricks you can make those work, but it's hard to do and will still be too overwhelming for many readers.

So, what's the difference? I've thought about this a lot and experimented with many ideas. Below is my best summary of how to write a _deep_ and _rich_ story, without making it _difficult_ and _complicated_.

As you read this, though, remember this general rule.

> It's easier to _simplify_ a complicated story, than to take an overly simple story and make it more compelling _later_.

The first draft of your story will almost always be too long and too convoluted. That's fine. Simplifying is the next step. If your first draft is too short and simplistic, however, it's hard to grow it into more at a later stage.

## What's the problem?

What does it mean when somebody says "well, that was a complicated movie"?

They usually mean the following: "_I_ did not _understand_ what happened or why".

The "complexity" of a story is not some objective measurement, like calling a story complicated once it has more then 500 pages, or more than 10 characters.

It's about understanding (or experience) from the audience.

A story can have lots of moving parts, but if they work well together, the story is easy to follow. Conversely, a story can have one extremely simplistic plot, but if it's told badly it becomes complicated.

So no, you are not in the clear by playing it safe and writing a simplistic story, because execution matters.

And yes, you can still write that epic with many storylines, or that murder mystery with an extremely intricate puzzle. 

You just have to sidestep some common pitfalls.

## Pitfalls

These are pitfalls. So **don't** do the things the heading says!

### Loose Ends

People learn and remember based on _association_.

If you have two storylines that have _nothing_ in common, they will be incredibly hard to remember. The story becomes complicated.

If those same storylines constantly reference and influence each other, they are much easier to remember! The story has now become deep and rich.

This is true for the (major) storylines, but also the smaller things.

If you introduce an object in chapter 3 (giving it some time, description, setup) ... and it never returns ... then it's a "loose end". It's another bit of information floating in your audience's brain, not connected to anything.

Do it once, okay. Do it twice or more often and these loose ends drag down your story like dead weight.

To prevent a loose end, let that object return later with a purpose. Even better, make it return _several_ times, across different locations and storylines, so the audience can _associate_ it with many other aspects of the story.

This combines into the following rule.

> If you have multiple storylines, they _must_ influence each other and be combined at some point (usually the end).

Yes, this might seem too "restrictive". I'd like to tell you otherwise, but all my experience has solidified this as a core part of storytelling. The first step to prevent making a story (with many threads) complicating, is to ensure all those threads meet up before the end.

This also has a natural consequence: you cannot add too many "ideas" into your story. Because each idea _must_ reoccur several times and paid off at some point. That takes time, that takes words. So if you want any hope of making your story the right length, you need to be disciplined when it comes to adding new ideas.

### No theme or conflicting themes

Earlier, when talking about themes, I remarked the importance of sticking to **one** theme. Now you have another reason why.

Stories are much easier to follow if everything is (somehow) related to the same theme, the same main thread. (This is also a sort-of consequence of the pitfall above about association.)

{{% example %}}
Maybe the theme is "forgiveness". One character might eventually learn to forgive another. A second character has the reverse arc, dispelling any thoughts of forgiveness, and becomes the antagonist. A third character did something in the past and must now _ask_ for forgiveness.

Already, you have three separate storylines. But as they revolve around the same theme, they feel like one simple thing.
{{% /example %}}

This obviously implies there must be a theme. In my view, stories _always_ have a theme. It's just about whether you accidentally added one, or did so on purpose.

You _can_ have "subthemes". But these should feed into the single main theme in some way.

{{% example %}}
Take that third character from the example above. Maybe their subtheme is "revenge". They took revenge for something, but now regret it. Revenge _turns into_ asking for forgiveness.
{{% /example %}}

### The major moments are about something else

Each story has major moments. Scenes more important than others. Scenes to which you've been building for a while, such as a climax.

An easy way to make a story _confusing_ is to make these major moments about entirely different things. Or to pick the wrong scenes to turn into major moments.

{{% example %}}
Our hero dreams of the big city and leaves his village. The major moment for him _should be_ his first arrival, seeing the beautiful city for the first time.

But we don't tell that. We skip over it to immediately start a big fight between him and a monster in the city. Action! Tension! Exciting!

That's the pitfall. The journey started with a goal, but the accomplishment of that goal is swept away like it's nothing, handing the spotlight to something thematically different.

People will respond with questions like: "So what was the film _about_? Where did that monster come from?" Even if you setup the monster and wrote a great scene, it still doesn't fit as a major moment.
{{% /example %}}

This is another reason why I firmly believe that different storylines must combine in the climax. Otherwise, you get a story with multiple "climaxes" at different times, making it unclear what should be major moments and what not.

### A list of motivations

Very, very guilty of this one.

Writers know they should give the character a _goal_ and a really strong desire to reach it. So they give them a motivation. Alright ... but it feels like it's not enough. They give them another motivation. Next chapter, they introduce _another_ reason for having that goal.

You get characters who are angry because ...

* Their boss is mean
* Somebody ran over their dog last week
* Their partner suddenly broke up after a relationship of five years
* They broke their leg and can't exercise anymore

All of those at the same time! They must be _very_ frustrated!

But this is confusing. A story should be a heightened, streamlined version of reality to provide the most interest. In a story, characters should have one clear motivation that the audience will not forget.

For example: "Sarah is angry because her best friend stole money from her"

That's it. Don't add anything else. Don't think this is too little.

Sounds very simple, but keeping things simple is always the hardest skill in art.

If you really like grey characters or diving deep into personalities, you _can_ add multiple motivations. But if you do, they should still be _associated_ with each other. 

For example, Sarah is angry because ...

* Her best friend stole money
* Her partner took another job that earns less money
* Her parents don't want to support her financially

All of those are related to the same theme of "Sarah has money issues". Still simple and easy to remember, but with more layers.

### Unnecessary characters

We often invent characters to serve a purpose. I might think "oh, we need some best friend or sidekick for our hero, let's add one", or "we need a really strong fighter on this quest, let's add a character who can do that"

Often, however, this is a singular purpose. Once fulfilled, the character becomes useless. 

You see this often in TV shows. They made a first season, not knowing if they'd be greenlit for a second one. When they make the second one ... they suddenly have all these characters that fans love, but serve no purpose! So they get shoved around, standing in the background, doing practically nothing for a full season. It hurts. It drags a story down.

Don't add characters for _one_ scene or _one_ big moment. Add them because they will continue to be interesting, no matter where the story goes.

Or, if that is hard to achieve, _combine_ several "single-purpose" characters into **one character**.

And if you find two characters serving the exact same purpose, then you can obviously cut one of them entirely.

Doing this, you reduce the pool of characters ( = simpler story), while making each character itself more interesting and layered ( = rich story).

{{% remark %}}
You can turn this into a "test". Once your story is done, look at the whole story through the eyes of _one_ (perhaps minor) character. If you notice they're doing nothing the whole time, or the story seems nonsensical/random from _their_ perspective, you have things to fix.

### Whiplash

Often, we try to balance stories. We try to add some "heart" (some sad or emotional moments), but also some "humor" (funny or silly scenes).

The bad way to do it, would be to rapidly switch between those two extremes. It gives the audience whiplash. It is confusing and overwhelming. It feels like telling two _separate_ stories, but trying to cram them into one.

As I've stated numerous times, the meat of the story is _not_ in the extremes or the big moments. The meat of each story is the little scenes that provide the glue, the bits of "progress" along the way.

Use the progress to properly build towards your extremes. You can have both sadness and humor in the same story, but ... 

* The transition should be gradual.
* The moments should be _earned_.
* And the extremes should still be closely linked and related, to prevent it feeling like two separate stories.

If you do it well, those two extremes actually provide great **contrast**. The sad scenes make the funny ones extra funny. Similarly, the funny scenes---with banter among the characters---make it all the more emotional when a main character dies a few chapters later.

### Inconsistent Writing

Of course, all other writing rules still apply. A story rapidly becomes _complicated_ if the prose is bad and the writing vague!

More specifically, these are common mistakes.

* The writing switches tenses (sometimes past tense, sometimes present tense) => Pick one and stick to it
* You have too many different viewpoint characters. Especially bad if you suddenly _switch_ perspective to different characters within a scene ("head hopping") => Pick a tiny cast of characters to narrate chapters
* Your sentences are too long and you use too much "purple prose" => When in doubt, write shorter and simpler
* That a sentence is grammatically correct or has the right information, doe snot mean it's the right sentence. => Seek _clarity_ above all,  _flow_ (or _rhythm_) to your writing second, anything else after that
* Your chapters or scenes go on for too long. => Arrive late, Exit early, and always question whether something needs to exist.
* Your narrative makes big changes (scene break, location change, ...) without clearly communicating this. => Use some clear sign---such as whitespace, a symbol, a simple sentence on its own---to communicate to the reader we just jumped to a different setting.

## Conclusion

The difference between a compelling and complicated story will always be a subjective one. (There are many movies that I find interesting and deep, and others complicated and pretentious.)

It's up to experience and your own intuition to find a balance. But the best test is to let _others_ read your story. Others who don't know anything about it yet. They will show disinterest or stop reading (for a while) if they find the story too complicated.

{{% example %}}
I once wrote a story and asked about ten others to read it. Almost all of them "paused" after chapter 3. Now, people have the annoying habit of not wanting to hurt your feelings, so they'll tell you "no it was great I was just low on time". 

Don't listen to what they say; look at what they do. My story clearly slowed to a halt in chapter 3 and I had to fix it.

The other test is to check the following.

* A **complicated** story has dead weight. It allows you to cut away large chunks of the story _without_ changing or breaking anything. (Either it's literally not associated with anything else, or other parts of the story are still equally vaguely setup as before.)
* A **compelling** story does not allow this. Nothing can be cut without consequence. Everything is tied together. Each character, each scene, each storyline, it's all of vital importance. In the end, they all combine to defeat the villain, and if even _one_ piece was missing, they would not have won!

Yes, this might seem boring or predictable. If a story has multiple storylines, they'll likely meet up and combine at some point. If the story focuses on mentioning a magical object (several times), you know it will be really important later. 

(And if it doesn't happen, even if surprising, it will be _dissatisfying_. Similar to a setup that has no payoff.)

But I feel this is one of the core truths of storytelling. I tried breaking such rules, but it didn't work. Not a single time.

The key word is _association_ to help the audience learn and remember. If everything is connected, it's more easily remembered. If something is mentioned or used multiple times, in different settings, it will surely be remembered.

And if the audience truly learns the parts of the story, there's a much greater chance they will _understand_ the whole of it. And a story you understand, is never a complicated story in your eyes.

A third test is to check if you approach every new chapter with motivation and a clear head, or groaning and uncertain what to do. If I think "man I'm too tired to continue writing this story", I know I've made my story too complicated and convoluted. If I can't even continue writing---how do I expect readers to continue reading?
