To make sure we're on the same page, this chapter gives my definition of character and a general overview of the theory for it. This will be similar to how most authors think about them, although I did my best to simplify it for now. (The next few chapters, this simple definition will be expanded into a more detailed definition.)

> A character is an _entity_ within a story with the ability to act, based on personal goals they try to achieve, thus creating plot or setting.

Notice the broadness of this definition. It allows you to view objects or concepts (such as magic) as "characters" as well, which I think is useful. The more every element of your world _feels_ like an interesting _character_, the more easily people will bond with it and care about it.

Obviously, any living being is a character. In most stories, that'll mean every human is a character.

But what if the human is sick and unable to act anymore? They're literally in a coma? To me, they are not a character, for they have absolutely no influence on the rest of the story.

A wall is not a character. A magic wall that reacts to the environment and sometimes opens a portal to another world _is_ a character, as it can act and react to change the plot. If you view the wall this way, you can turn it from a lifeless object into something readers care about more.

Also note the last part of the definition. As mentioned in the introduction, characters cannot stand on their own. They _create_ plot by what they want and what they do. They _create_ setting by living inside a certain environment, being a product of that environment.

## The first element

That's the simplest way to check if a character works: check if they serve a PURPOSE.

> See if their existence influences the plot of the story or reinforces the setting. If not, scrap them or change them, as they're doing nothing for your story.

One of my oldest stories (unpublished) took place at a high school. You followed a whole class for a year, as they try to solve a mystery. By default, I invented _parents_ for all those kids as well. If you visited somebody's home, for example, there'd be a short meeting or conversation with their _parents_.

Yes, it is realistic. Most kids _do_ have parents, both of them. But why mention them all? Why include them all? It resulted in LOADS of characters, most without purpose for the story.

I should've only included a few parents to reinforce the _setting_, and those should only be the parents that actually influenced the story in some way.

In a similar vein, many writers include characters that sound cool or have cool abilities ... which they forget about later, because they have no place in the plot. This is an easy way to overcomplicate your story and make it muddy, even if your cool character is _actually_ really cool.

You _can_ say that "this character only exists to add humor" or "this character only exists to give information/explanation about my fantasy world", because then the character has _purpose_. But even then, this is a weak version of a character that usually falls flat.

My earliest stories for The Saga of Life had this issue. I really liked cracking jokes and having smartass characters when I was a kid---apparently---because most stories contained a character that did nothing besides _that_. They were just ... hanging around every scene and making fun of the others. 

While this did create some funny jokes or situations, it made the stories way longer than they should be. Every scene was dragged out, because there was one character interrupting and doing nothing to advance the plot. Every scene fell flat, because any emotional development was undercut with a joke.

When I revised them years later, I cut all those characters without issue. That was my biggest clue that they were _not_ an addition and did nothing to influence plot. Only one of them could not be cut, so I changed the character to actually be _important_. Also, changes like these usually won me 5,000 words, on a short story.

## The second element

What makes characters different from plot or setting? I mean, when you create a plot, you _also_ look for stuff that serves a purpose. When you build your setting, you _also_ use ideas that serve a purpose.

But for characters, merely purpose is not enough. Similar to how we are somewhat defined by our jobs or our careers, but certainly not _entirely_ defined by them! (Hopefully not.)

The second ingredient is EMPATHY.

> Characters are your _emotional core_. Their personality and development should highlight the _theme_ of your story, the thing that actually resonates deeply with your audience.

Many writers learn this and draw the wrong conclusions. Oh, every character needs to be empathetic? Also the villains? Well, I'll make all characters _sweet_ and _nice_ and give them _tragic backstories_ that make everything okay!

That's not the point. The most empathy should go towards your main characters---your heroes. All other characters exist to fill roles _they cannot fill_. To serve purposes that the heroes _cannot serve_. As such, by definition, they'll have the opposite traits or viewpoints. This conflict makes for a rich world and engaging story. Taking it all away by making everyone nice and friendly, ruins the whole idea of story.

Most writers use the "core of decency" rule. Yes, make your villains _bad, evil, cruel people_. But give them _some_ sliver of decency, some proof they have a heart, some reason for readers to be empathetic. Because ...

> Feeling empathy is _not_ the same as agreeing with or approving of someone's actions.

It's just not the same thing. Empathy is _understanding_ why another human is who they are, or did what they did. 

So, adding empathy for your characters does not mean making them all good people. It means making the audience understand _why_ they're bad people, while recognizing they're still _people_.

Just now, I read the _Three-Body Problem_ (SPOILERS!). One of our main characters does a very evil thing. They invite an alien civilization to come to Earth and wipe out humans, because the human race is just terrible and deserves to be erased. 

The book _starts_ with several chapters from her viewpoint. In those chapters, we experience the events that made her so bitter towards humans, so cold. This gives _understanding_ and makes the reader empathetic to her, even if she does things probably nobody would deem good. It makes the story interesting to read, rather than just frustrating or like we're supposed to root for some maniac.

## Conclusion

There you have it. Characters are PURPOSE + EMPATHY.

Forget purpose, and the character should be cut from the story. It does nothing but make the story muddy and bloated.

Forget empathy, and the character could just have been a random talking stone about which readers do not care.

If you successfully include both elements, the character could be anything and it will work.

Now let's see, in the next chapter, where we can find ourselves some good characters.
