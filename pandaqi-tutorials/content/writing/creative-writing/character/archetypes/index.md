Earlier, I mentioned how most people _roughly_ fit into one or multiple stereotypes. A while ago, Karl Jung formalized these into 12 Archetypes. Below I'll give a short overview of the archetypes, their strengths and weaknesses, and their general role in stories.

Whenever you're stuck inventing characters, you can use this list as a guide. Pick a different archetype for each character, and try to stay true to it.

To keep things simple and bite-sized, I split the archetypes into 3 sub-categories.

* Ego: those who are able to discard their ego and live in service of others.
* Soul: those who have a passion in their soul and let it rule them.
* Self: those who are mostly occupied with developing themselves.

## Another approach

Below is an image of the archetypes. It groups them into four categories based on another category. It's up to you which explanation you like more and want to use (the one above or the image). They're about the same archetypes!

## Now write!

Pick a few archetypes. Turn them into characters, then write the story around them.

As with all these challenges, the goal is not to write a full novel. It's not even to write a _good_ story. The goal is just to experiment with applying this tool to a (very) short story. To see if it works for you. To help memorize the different archetypes or at least get an intuition for them.

As you see, all the archetypes have strengths and weaknesses, innate goals and fears. These immediately present opportunities for challenges and limitations. For flaws that they might need to overcome.
