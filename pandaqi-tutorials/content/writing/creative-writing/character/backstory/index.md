This chapter is the last one, because I hesitated on writing it. I'm an improviser, which means I invent backstory "as I go". I could not remember or write down any tips or techniques for doing so. After improvising backstories for so long, it just happens automatically, and things seem to come together in my stories. (Usually.)

That being said, it _is_ an important aspect of writing character. Backstory is basically the explanation for _why_ they're the way they are. It's another story, unwritten, that comes before the current one. This course taught you that empathy is crucial, and empathy comes from understanding, which naturally means that _backstory_ is crucial.

I actually did not do this in my earliest stories. Characters were just ... the way they are. There was never information about their past, because they did not _have_ an interesting past. This was surely a mistake. It made characters all feel like the same cardboard cutouts. It felt like they were "born" at the start of the story, and only to serve the story, because there was no history.

## The key

But I guess I already gave you the answer. 

> Backstory should create empathy. It does so by explaining what events lead to a character's current state.

A secondary purpose of backstory is to reveal information or mystery. But this should be handled with care, because if a character actually knows crucial information or secrets, then audiences are quick to ask the (annoyed) question: "why don't they just TELL that!?"

No, the first and foremost purpose is the mystery of "why is our hero so distrusting?" or "how did the hero lose their leg?" or "why isn't the hero speaking to his mother anymore?"

So, as a simple step-by-step guide to backstory, you'd have.

* Invent a great character for your current story.
* Look at their biggest strengths and weaknesses, their most memorable details.
* For each of them, figure out a reason for _why_ they exist.
* Connect these reasons into a coherent backstory for the character.
* Reveal this backstory in bits and pieces, at relevant moments (not all at once)

You _can_ do it the other way around: you invent a great backstory, then base your character on that. The pitfall here is, of course, that your resulting character is not a great fit for the actual story you're telling. And the _actual_ story is always more important than the _backstory_.

This works best if your great backstory is just a _prequel_ to the story. If the backstory is so interesting, turn it into a full story! (And once that story is done, you know the state of your character at that point, and can write subsequent plots around it.)

## An example

This is an example of the "backstory as I go"-approach. I like to do this because, as stated, the actual story is more important then backstory. I focus on the main plot first, trying to come up with interesting scene after interesting scene, and let that _determine_ my backstory. Otherwise, you run the risk of planning some great background for a character, but having no exciting or suitable way to communicate it in the main story.

In my book series _Wildebyte Arcades_, our hero is placed into the world of video games to achieve a mission. They forgot their life _before_ they were put in here.

As such, a large part of those stories concerns the Wildebyte trying to rediscover their own backstory! But ... I didn't actually know that backstory!

I wrote the stories whatever way seemed interesting to me. Whenever I had a quiet moment, I invented some new information about Wildebyte's "real life" on the spot. New information that sounded interesting or cool.

Over time, this gives me a long _list_ of everything I've made up. A list of backstory parts (which are already neatly integrated into the plot of each story!) that I simply have to connect. 

I was somewhat "lucky" that I had to restart the first book several times. This allowed me to write _multiple_ scenes that revealed new backstory ideas, so my list is actually a lot longer than what you learn in the first book.

Most importantly? After doing this, while standing underneath the shower, my head connected all the dots. It had figured out a way to connect all this backstory into one or two _simple_ explanations that work. That same realization allowed me to figure out the climax to the book: a book that deals with "discovering your own past" so much, obviously had to end with a big reveal about that.

### Why restart the first book several times?

I think the answer to this is very educational for beginning writers, that's why I mention it.

At my first try, I included _multiple_ video games in one book. I thought this was very exciting! And diverse! The Wildebyte hops between games, so let's showcase that immediately.

But this didn't work. It made the stories messy and complicated. I vowed to do exactly _one_ video game per story, never more, never less. This helped _focus_ the stories and streamline the plot.

Then I wrote the second version, but it still didn't work. Wildebyte was already "fully formed" from chapter 1! They could already hop between games and understood their (technical) world. So what was there to learn? What mysteries were there to reveal? What was left to tell? The stories were _already_ backstory-heavy ... and I just made them about telling _backstory_ even more!

The lesson here? Do not start your story too early, but also do not start it _too late_. Instead of revealing interesting backstory later on, actually make that happen at the start of the story.

I wrote another version, which literally starts (very first line) with the Wildebyte being dropped into the computer world for the very first time. That worked much better.

But I wasn't done. They were dropped immediately into their "fake game" (for the mission). They had almost no issue navigating and could start the mission immediately. Wildebyte lacked those _restrictions_ that make characters interesting. 

So yes, another version. The drop went wrong: they were placed at the wrong location. The computer sees Wildebyte as a virus to remove. All the limitations of video games or software _also_ apply to Wildebyte.

As they say: all writing is rewriting. And your first chapters are _so_ crucial to making sure your story isn't broken, that I think it's worthwhile to try a few different approaches until you find the best one.
