This is a very simple technique for improving characters. Every time I've written a story, every time I used it, I realized it was even more powerful than I thought.

I call it the "self-contradiction" or the "paradoxical character". To me, there are two levels. The first is easier to write, but less powerful. The second is harder to write, but will create a truly compelling character.

## Level 1: competing desires

The technique is simple.

> Give your character two competing desires. They desperately want _two_ things, but can realistically only have _one_.

A few chapters ago I gave the example of a hacker who wants to sit in their room behind their computer ... but who also enjoys nature and wants to go outside all day. Two simple competing desires, but they immediately lead to interesting story.

The character is always moving, because there's always this tug-of-war happening inside them. You never know for certain what they will choose or what they'll do, making them less predictable or superficial. The trick of competing desires is a very simple way to ensure a _dynamic_ character that never sits still, while presenting a problem that many will have faced in real life.

Of course, you can apply this to any desires. But as always, it's better to make the contrast as big as possible. If somebody only "kind of" desires something, it's not strong enough and the technique doesn't work.

Say we have a princess. She desires to become queen (perhaps out of a sense of duty or power), but she also wants a simple life and doesn't like the constant attention and that she needs to uphold a reputation. Two competing desires. 

Every time a choice or conflict arises, the audience will be at the edge of their seats to see which side wins. From the start of the story, when these two desires should've been introduced, they'll wonder which one wins in the end.

On the other hand, imagine a character who would enjoy going to the movies one night, but also going to a fancy restaurant. These are competing desires, yes. They can only do one thing that night. But they're small choices, made only once. That's not enough to sustain a compelling character through a whole story.

## Level 2: paradoxical traits

Instead of competing desires, you can go one step further and build a character out of multiple contradicting parts or traits. 

On the surface, these traits seem paradoxical or nonsensical. How can a character be both "angry" and "calm"? How can they be both "a murderous criminal" and a "gentle lover"? How can they be both "unbelievably smart" and "incredibly stupid"?

Well ... that precise question _makes the character interesting_. If you present your character as this great contradiction at the start, the audience will become interested and ask such questions.

But how does this work? How do you write it? How do you prevent this contradiction from simply being an inconsistent mess?

It starts by realizing that character traits are often **situational**. Every character has an emotional limit. When they're below the threshold, they display behavior X. But when pressed, when pushed beyond the limit, they display behavior Y.

An easy way to formulate this, is by writing down the following sentence for each character.

> They always do X, _except_ in situation Y.

Obviously, you replace X and Y by anything you invent.

{{% example %}}
This character always thinks ahead and makes smart moves ... except when they're close to somebody they're in love with. Then they become incredibly dumb.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
This character is angry and violent ... except when they're in front of their children.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
This character is egotistical ... except when their family is in danger.
{{% /example %}}

With this simple technique, you can get a character with a wide range of (competing or contradicting) traits. But it makes sense and is understandable to the audience, creating empathy and interest.

This is also a great way to _show_ who a character is without telling the audience directly: by creating a contrast or contradiction between how they _portray themselves_ and who they _truly are_. 

You might call this the trait of a **good character arc**: the whole story builds to the moment when somebody's _true_ character is finally revealed. The thing that was inside them all along finally comes out during a twist, or climax, or impactful conflict. (Could be good---which looks like a change into a better person---or bad---creating the antihero or the fall from grace.)

Han Solo in Star Wars constantly says he only cares about himself and has this air of narcissism and egoism around him. But his actions constantly show that he helps others, until he finally ends up being a crucial piece in victory over the empire. Under pressure, near the climax of the story, his _true_ character has shown itself. Such contrast creates interesting character.

## Now write!

Write a story with characters developed using this technique. Use level 1 for most characters, but level 2 for the main character(s).

You'll notice your characters will surprise you. If you stay consistent to their definition, they'll constantly make interesting choices or turn scenes into a surprising event. Hopefully you also notice how this constant tension within the character keeps the story moving forward and yearns to be resolved.

I know this simple trick helped _me_ a lot to improve my characters. I use it almost in reverse nowadays: if a character has no conflict inside them, then they're boring and superficial, and I want to change them.
