Congratulations! You've finished the course about Character (in Creative Writing). Hopefully I've given you tools for designing great characters that make your story come alive. Hopefully you also understand _why_ certain characters work and others don't.

As mentioned several times, the [Storytelling](../../storytelling/) course provides a full practical overview (for beginners) that handles all aspects of story. If you haven't read that, do so now. It links, whenever applicable, to the other more specific courses.

After that, I suggest you learn about the triangle first (Character, [Plot](../../plot/), [Setting](../../worldbuilding)). So if you haven't read one of those yet, do so now!

And finally, it never hurts to read about more specific skills such as [Dialogue](../../dialogue/) or [Prose](../../prose/). Or even [Publishing](../../publishing), if you've finished your story.

Now I leave you with the same advice as always. The only way to get better at something, is by _doing_ it a lot, and regularly _challenging_ yourself (by doing it differently than usual). That's why my writing courses focus on giving you unique tools, then asking you to write a story with this experimental idea.

So where to go from now? Keep telling stories. Even bad ones. Even experimental ones that will never sell or are sure to fail. As long as you keep writing stories, you're good.

Keep learning,
