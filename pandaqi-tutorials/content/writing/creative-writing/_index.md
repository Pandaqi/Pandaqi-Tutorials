This category contains all courses related to creative writing. If you're just starting out, I recommend the [Storytelling](./storytelling/) course. It's a practical guide from start to finish about writing a book, with links to the other courses whenever needed.

Each of the courses, however, can also be read on their own. I try to teach in a practical, efficient and useful way. Each course mostly contains _tools_ and asks you to just play around with each new tool. For example, each chapter in the Plot course might give you one "trick" or "narrative structure" to help formulate a nice plot. It's up to you to take this information and apply it immediately to a story!

That's the best way to learn and to get a lot of experience with creative writing. Have fun inventing great stories!
