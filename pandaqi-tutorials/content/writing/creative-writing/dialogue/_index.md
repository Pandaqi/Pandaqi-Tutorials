Dialogue is one of the main methods for conveying story. In a book, it's one of many methods to communicate information. In film or theatre, it's almost the _only_ way to tell the story. That's why I think any writer would do well to practice their dialogue skills, and that's why I wrote this separate course about it! (All other elements of prose are discussed in the [Prose](../prose/) course.)
