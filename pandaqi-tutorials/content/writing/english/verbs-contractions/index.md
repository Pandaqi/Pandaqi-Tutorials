Where are we now? You know the present tense and how to modify it. You know common verbs: to be, to do and to have. How they work on their own, and how they help other verbs. You will see those auxiliary verbs in action very soon.

One topic remains, before we can learn the other tenses: negation. We've already seen it at work for _nouns_. The word remains the same: **not**.

But English remains English. Of course we're going to **contract** this!

Remember: contraction means "make smaller". It's when you combine two words into one.

## Helper negations

Because auxiliary and modal verbs are _so common_, they have contractions. If a sentence is negated, the word **not** is eaten by the verb to get the table below.

| \-      | to be   | \-        | to do   | \-        | to have | \-        |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| \-      | *present*  | *past*  | *present* | *past*  | *present* | *past*  |
| I       | aren't | wasn't | don't  | didn't | haven't       | hadn't |
| He/she/it | isn't  | wasn't | doesn't       | didn't | hasn't | hadn't |
| Other    | aren't | weren't       | don't  | didn't | haven't       | hadn't |

To negate a sentence, replace the verb by its contraction.

When used on their own ...

{{% example %}}
* You are happy (😀) => You aren't happy (😡)
* We are friends (🤝) => We aren't friends (👎)
* I have the time (⏳) => I haven't the time (⌛)
{{% /example %}}

The modal verbs form their contraction the same way: by adding **n't** at the end. 

The verb **will** is special. It contracts to **won't**. Its other form, **shall**, contracts to **shan't**.

So, when used as a modal verb ...

{{% example %}}
* You should know this => You shouldn't know this!
* You can dance => You can't dance
* We could have won => We couldn't have won anyway
* I will try the milk => I won't try the milk
{{% /example %}}

## All other negations

Now I hope you realize something important. All other verbs ... don't have this negated version.

I mean, how would you negate "to swim"? Swimn't? Notswim? Swimnot?

How do we negate those? By _adding_ a helper verb and negating _that_. 

For the **present simple**, it's **do**.

{{% example %}}
* You tell a story => You **don't** tell a story
* We walk to the beach => We **don't** walk to the beach.
* They eat bread => They **don't** eat bread.
{{% /example %}}

{{% remark %}}
You can also add "do" in a normal sentence. But that really emphasizes the word, like you're trying to make a point: "But ... but ... they *do* eat bread! 😮"
{{% /remark %}}

Which modal verb to add depends on the tense. As you saw, it's "do" for the present.

_Why_? Because if a _modal verb_ is present, _they_ are responsible for having the correct tense! The main verb can chill out and do nothing. The modal verb will be changed to show the tense.

{{% example %}}
* I walked to the beach => I **didn't** walk to the beach
* They danced all night => They **didn't** dance all night.
{{% /example %}}

Don't worry. The tenses will be explained soon!

Just remember this idea: when a modal verb is present, _they_ will conjugate to fit the tense. And the main verb stays the same.

## Pronoun Contractions

These verbs are also commonly paired with pronouns. So, obviously, English created contractions for that.

All auxiliary verbs can be contracted with the subject, as long as ...

* The sentence is *affirmative* (not negated)
* The subject is a *pronoun* or *determiner* (you'll learn those later)

| \-      | to be     |  to have  |   had    |    will   |      would
| ------- | --------- |  ---------| ---------| ----------| -----------
| I       | I'm       | I've      | I'd      | I'll      |  I'd
| You     | You're    | You've    | You'd    | You'll    |  You'd
| He      | He's      | He's      | He'd     | He'll     |  He'd
| She     | She's     | She's     | She'd    | She'll    |  She'd
| It      | It's      | It's      | It'd     | It'll     |  It'd
| We      | We're     | We've     | We'd     | We'll     |  We'd
| They    | They're   | They've   | They'd   | They'll   |  They'd
| There   | There's   | There's   | There'd  | There'll  |  There'd
| That    | That's    |           |  That'd  |  That'll  |   That'd

{{% remark %}}
"There" and "that" are the determiners. You can see them as pronouns for non-human things. "I like my garden. There's so much life!"
{{% /remark %}}

{{% example %}}
* I am Tiamo => **I'm** Tiamo
* I have brought cake => **I've** brought cake
* When I was young, I would sing => When I was young, **I'd** sing
* We will do that => **We'll** do that
{{% /example %}}

A common error is writing "it's" and "its" in the wrong situations. The first one is a contraction of a _pronoun_ and _verb_. The second one is a _possessive pronoun_. (These were taught at [Pronouns](../pronouns/).)

{{% example %}}
* It is no problem => **It's** no problem
* My phone has lost the battery it has => My phone has lost **its** battery
{{% /example %}}

Hopefully you agree that these contractions save a lot of space. This is why English can communicate a lot of information with very few words or symbols.

Some people are very _against_ contractions. I don't agree. Always use them, it's short and sweet. The _only_ reason to write something in full, is to _emphasize_ it.

{{% example %}}
"You aren't a student here!" => "No, I _am_ a student here!"
{{% /example %}}

## Questions

In the [Pronouns](../pronouns/) chapter, I discussed contractions to change the intention of a _question_. Now we have verbs, contractions and negation!

Which means I can formally explain and define how to form questions in English.

To form a question, **switch the subject and modal verb**. So, the sentence starts with the modal verb and the subject comes after it.

{{% example %}}
You have seen the news => Have you seen the news?
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
He should take the bus => Should he take the bus?
{{% /example %}}

Again, if no modal verb exists, you insert it yourself.

{{% example %}}
They walk down the road => **Do** they walk down the road?
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
You see a cow => **Do** you see a cow?
{{% /example %}}

And to answer questions, you repeat the modal verb. If the answer is negative, you negate it.

{{% example %}}
Have you seen the news? => Yes, **I have**.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
Do you walk down the road? => No, **I don't**.
{{% /example %}}

## Cross questions

And finally, another interesting bit from the English language. They have a very indirect way of asking questions, a bit passive-agressive. 

* First you simply make a _statement_. (Not a question, just a statement.)
* Then you **repeat the modal verb and subject, but reversed**. 

I call this a cross question. You can remember it that way. If the statement is affirmative, they repeat it negated. If the statement is negative, they repeat it affirmative.

![The image my English teacher drew when she explained this in high school.](cross_questions.webp)

{{% example %}}
You've eaten all the cookies, **haven't you**?! (Sentence is positive, so repeat with a negative.)
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
He didn't do his homework, **did he**?! (Sentence is negative, so repeat with a positive.)
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
They will finish in time, **won't they**?
{{% /example %}}

Essentially, this turns a statement into a question. I think it's a fun bit of the English language. It's also very common, so it's good to learn it now.

## Conclusion

Finally, finally, we can continue with the actual verb tenses. 

English has well-defined tenses. They may seem _similar_ to one in your own language, but are probably different if you look more closely. 

But you should be very comfortable with the hiccups of English by now! So I'm sure it is no problem. Let's get some action going now.
