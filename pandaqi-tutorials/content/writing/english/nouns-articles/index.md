Earlier, I talked about placing "the" in front of English words. I've quietly used it in all examples so far. This chapter will finally explain it! 

That little word is called an **article**. Articles tell us two things:

* A noun will follow
* If it's a single thing (😀) or multiple things (😀😀)
* If it's a reference to something mentioned earlier

## Singular (😀)

### General

If you refer to one thing _in general_, an **a** is placed before it. 

If the noun starts with a *vowel sound* (if you pronounce it), you use **an**. This sounds beter, because otherwise you have two vowels right after each other.

{{% example %}}
A dog 🐕, an apple 🍎, an award 🏆, a young bird 🐣, an hour ⏳, ...
{{% /example %}}

Which dog? Don't know. It's _a_ dog. Any of them. The general concept of a dog.

### Specific

But if you refer to one _specific thing_, place **the** before it.

{{% example %}}
The dog 🐕, the apple 🍎, the award 🏆, the young bird 🐣, the hour ⏳, ...
{{% /example %}}

It's not just a dog. It's _the_ dog I mentioned before!

In writing, we usually go from _general_ to _specific_. First you have to _introduce something_, before you can refer back to that specific thing. So using these after each other is common:

{{% example %}}
The man eats **an** apple. **The** apple tastes nice.
{{% /example %}}

Because we introduced the apple in the first sentence (with _an_), we can now use a specific noun (_the_) to talk about it.

## Plural (😀😀+)

What if there isn't _one_ of something, but _multiple_? This is called a **plural**.

In this case, you 

* Always use **the**
* And change the noun to *plural form*

What is plural form?

-   Place an **-s** at the end.
-   If it already ends with an s-like sound, place **-es** at the end instead. 
-   If it ends in **-y**, with no vowel before it, replace the *y* with **-ies**.

{{% example %}}
* Cat 🐱 => Cats
* Boy 👦 => Boys
* Wish ✨ => Wishes (rule 2)
* Fox 🦊 => Foxes (rule 2)
* Baby 👶 => babies (rule 3)
* City 🌆 => cities (rule 3)
{{% /example %}}

_What are s-like sounds?_ These letter combinations: **s, z, x, ch, sh**. If you say them out loud, they sound like an "s". That's why they have a special rule. Just like _a_ and _an_, they prevent doubling of the same letter.

_But, without "a", how do I describe a general noun?_ By leaving out the article entirely!

{{% example %}}
The two dogs chased each other. => "The two dogs" refers to dogs already mentioned

Two dogs chased each other. => "Two dogs" are mentioned for the first time, without specific details.

Many common nouns have irregular plurals. These are often the oldest words in the language, in a time when people wanted to differentiate these concepts more. (They couldn't speak as well as now and certainly couldn't write as well.) 

You'll learn them by reading a lot, but here are common ones ...

| Singular   | Plural     | Singular   | Plural |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Woman      | Women      | Man        | Men |
| Child      | Children   | Tooth      | Teeth |
| Foot       | Feet       | Person     | People |
| Fish       | Fish       | Sheep      | Sheep |
| Wife       | Wives      | Mouse      | Mice |

## Capitalization & Nationalities

You've already seen me capitalize some words that are _not_ at the start of the sentence. Like "English". And of course the pronoun "I". 

Like most languages, we sometimes use a capital letter for words within a sentence to communicate even more meaning to the reader. English, fortunately, has some easy rules for this.

A noun is capitalized if it is

-   The first word of the sentence
-   A name
-   The first personal pronoun (I); you'll learn these soon
-   A month, day, season or holiday
-   A name or title. (This includes names of streets, buildings, oceans,
    cities, regions, etcetera.)
-   A language, nationality or adjective relating to nationality.

* Today **I** went to school
* My name is **T**iamo.
* The first day of **M**arch is **M**onday
* In **C**alifornia live no people of **L**ondon. 
* The water in the **A**tlantic doesn't come from the **H**imalayas.
* He lives in **C**hina. 
* The **F**rench food was tasty. 
* He speaks **E**nglish. 
* They are **J**apanese. 
* Those **S**paniards are handsome.

The names for countries, their language, and their corresponding adjective can differ a lot. They are quite irregular. Look up the right word for a country or culture when needed. 

* *In England live Englishmen, they speak English and drink English tea*. 
* *In Spain live Spaniards, they speak Spanish and drink Spanish wine.* 
* *In Holland live Dutchmen, they speak Dutch and make Dutch art*.
