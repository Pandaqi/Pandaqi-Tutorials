Nouns are the basic building blocks of every language, together with verbs. The subject of a sentence will always be a noun, just like the object. I start with these, instead of verbs, as they are way simpler to learn and understand.

> **Nouns:** names for people, things or concepts

## Role

In many languages, nouns receive different suffixes depending on their role within the sentence.

In Deutsch, the ending of a noun is different when its a subject than when its the object.

English does **not** do this. Nouns always stay the same. It doesn't care about the role in the sentence.

This makes them easy to learn!

## Gender

Another common rule in languages is to give words a _gender_. 

This is, most likely, also a remnant of how humans started communicating _a long time ago_. 

In a primitive world where procreation is everything, it's not strange to think everything in the world has a gender. Or to construct a language that has two versions of each word---one for each gender. 

Gender was simply one of the most important and consistent things in the natural world. Something that divided everything 50/50.

In Dutch, male/female words need "de" before it, while neutral words need "het". In English, each word has "the" and that's it.

Also, in Dutch, many descriptions for people have a male and female variant. A male teacher is "leraar", but a female teacher is "lerares".

English, again, _mostly_ ignores this. A *dog* doesn't have a specified gender, nor does a *house* or *chair*. It's always "the dog" and "the chair". You don't know anything else about that dog.

Therefore, you usually don't have to worry about gender. You might only find that in older writings. If you _want_ to specify gender, for whatever reason, you can put *male* or *female* in front. (A _male_ friend, a _female_ student.)

But some remnants of the past remain, usually where it makes the most sense. In that case, there are usually three completely different nouns to use. Some of the most common ones ...

| Masculine   | Feminine   | Neutral |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------|
| Man         | Woman      | Person |
| Father      | Mother     | Parent |
| Waiter      | Waitress   | Server |
| Husband     | Wife       | Spouse |
| Boy         | Girl       | Child |

You'll learn about _referring_ to a noun later, gendered or not.

## A remark on language
Somehow, language has become quite opinionated lately. People choosing their own pronouns. Words not being allowed anymore. Gender apparently not existing. I try to make this a course on how English works currently and nothing else.

So I will give my take only once. Then we can continue in peace.

> **All words are allowed and communication improves through specificity.**

What does this mean? Words aren't owned by anyone. The meaning given to them comes through mutual agreement. _Most_ people believe a word means X, so we assume it means X. 

But you can say anything you like. And if others don't like it, they can say anything back. Language is organic and very susceptible to human emotion and assumptions.

But _never_ hold back. Never censor, yourself or others. If somebody else thinks a word is foul and you are wrong to use it, that is _their problem_, as it is _their perception of the word_. 

Freedom of speech is something we should hold in high regard. Don't burn the books.

Additionally, I am quite sad that English does away with those common rules I explained above. Having two versions of a word for two common cases is _always_ better than having a single word. 

Why? It allows you to communicate more _specifically_ and more _clearly_. 

Remember, in Dutch if I say "lerares", the person listening already knows "a female teacher". I communicated _more meaning_ in a single word.

Similarly, in Latin, if a female word ends in "am" you already know it will be the object of the sentence. (Well, Latin is strange, there are always exceptions.)

That's why this course only explains the basic rules. I merely give some intuition about how language works in general. For example, why they often use gendered words. I don't force my style or preference on you, nor make predictions about where language is headed.

I won't mention anything about this again. Let's continue!
