Throughout this course, I'm trying to teach you grammar, but also the subtleties of the English language. The highlights and unique ideas. I do this to give a deeper understanding of the language. 

To give you the ability to pretend you've been English all your life ðŸ˜„ Because you understand _more_ than just some grammar rules and how to spell a few words.

You've seen remarks. You've seen contractions. Now comes the third bit: indefinite pronouns. 

They start off pretty normal, but near the end of the chapter you see some special uses for them in English.

## Indefinite pronouns

Indefinite pronouns replace a _specific_ noun for one that is _vague_.

When is this useful? If you don't _know_ the specific thing to which you want to refer. Or the thing you're referring has many parts, so it's way quicker to use a single pronoun.

{{% example %}}
Let's say you have to give a presentation. You stand in front of a group of people. But you don't know them, and certainly don't know their names. How do you address them? "Hello _everyone_" or "I welcome you _all_".
{{% /example %}}

They can replace a **person, thing** or **place**. They can refer to *all* of them, an undefined *part* of them, or *none* of them. 

| \-                | Person          | Thing           | Place           |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| *All*           | everyone<br/>everybody       | everything      | everywhere      |
| *Part*<br/> (affirmative)         | someone<br/>somebody        | something       | somewhere       |
| *Part* <br/> (negative)        | anyone<br/>anybody         | anything        | anywhere        |
| *None*          | no one<br/>nobody          | nothing         | nowhere         |

Which one to use depends on the type of sentence: **affirmative** or **negative**.

Usually, this replaces a _countable_ noun by an _uncountable_ one. But not always. A phrase like "we were two nobodies" is accepted as meaning "we were worth almost nothing". But a phrase like "I have two everythings" means nothing.

### Affirmative

Affirmative sentences are when something is **true**. (Or at least expected to be true.) When something is happening, someone is present, etcetera.

{{% example %}}
* **Everybody** aced that test.
* **Nobody** is sleeping at the moment.
* I looked **everywhere** for that book. 
* He thinks it must be **somewhere** around here.
{{% /example %}}

You can use a _negative_ indefinite pronoun in an _affirmative_ way. But only if it's very close to _every_ in its meaning. You should be able to replace "any" with "every" without changing the meaning.

{{% example %}}
You may invite **anyone**. She would give **anything** for that opportunity.
{{% /example %}}

### Negative

Negative sentences are when something is not **true**. (Or you don't expect it to be true.) It's not happening, not working, not available, not possible.

{{% example %}}
* He doesn't have **anything** to eat. 
* She hasn't gone **anywhere** the past few months. 
* He couldn't find **anybody** to work with.
{{% /example %}}

## Questions

Which of these do you think is used for questions? Affirmative or negative?

Well ... it depends.

On what? Your assumption. Do you _expect_ the answer to be true or false? Do you have any clue about the answer?

{{% example %}}
Did you see **anyone** when you were in the park?

We really don't know and are curious. So we use the negative version.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
Have you lost **something**?

You only ask this if you already _think_ somebody lost something. You see them searching or looking around. So we use the affirmative version.
{{% /example %}}

If you're _really certain_ about the answer you expect, you negate the sentence. (Add a _not_ into it.)

{{% example %}}
"Did you **not** eat anything yesterday?" 

We expect a no. This sentence is typically spoken if someone looks at your body and thinks you haven't eaten in a while!
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
Have**n't** you lost something? 

We expect a yes. This sentence is typically spoken by someone who has already seen that you lost something, but is waiting for you to realize this ðŸ˜‰
