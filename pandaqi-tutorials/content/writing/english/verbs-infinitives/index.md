I mentioned the infinitive right at the _start_ of the verb chapters. It's how you find verbs in the dictionary. If you drop the `to`, you get the form which you can use in like 80% of all sentences.

So it was a great way to introduce verbs. But I left out some important details and nuances, which I'd like to discuss now. Even though the infinitive isn't often used, it helps understand other concepts:

* I already explained how it was closely linked to the gerund. (Which is a common grammar construct.)
* The next chapter---the last one on verbs---will require this knowledge.

Two different types of infinitives exist:

-   The regular infinitive: **to + base verb** (*to remember*)
-   The zero infinitive: **base verb** (*remember*)

To negate it, you simply put the word **not** in front. (This can always be done, no contraction or irregularity needed.)

## Regular Infinitive

### Purpose or intention

You can test this by replacing *to* with *in order to* (or *so as to*) and the sentence should still work.

{{% example %}}
She came to school **to receive** her award. (👧➡️🏫 to 👐🏆)

She came to school **in order to receive** her award.
{{% /example %}}

### Subject

The original use I explained. The verb as the _general concept_ of doing something.

{{% example %}}
**To find** true love is the purpose of life!
{{% /example %}}

### To modify a noun

You modify a noun by saying in what _way_ it is true. 

For example, take the sentence: "You are easy."

They are "easy", but in what way? In which event are they easy? 

Let's modify it with an infinitive: "You are easy _to convince_". 

Now we know. They are easy when you're trying to "convince" them!

{{% example %}}
* She is a nice girl **to flirt** with. (How is "nice" meant? For flirting.)
* They are a dangerous group **to run into** late at night. (How are they "dangerous"? If you run into them.)
* Jim is the worst person **to ask** for these matters. (How is Jim the "worst"? When asking him.)
{{% /example %}}

### When measuring an action

Often, an action is only taken if you measure that it's possible. Or a good idea.

The word **too** measures an extreme. (Something is _too much_.)

The word **enough** measures a good balance. (Something is _just enough_.)

After these, an infinitive follows that describes _for what action_ you're measuring something.

{{% example %}}
* There is enough food **to feed** everyone here.
* She is too beautiful **to ignore**.
* They aren't smart enough **to study** this.
{{% /example %}}

### Measuring with nouns

The above can be extended when talking about a _noun_ and if it _can be used_ for an action. For example, is this space big enough for dancing? Is the weather good enough for a light jacket?

{{% example %}}
* They will need some space **to work** in.
* Would you like a slice of cake **to eat**?
* You require two goals **to play** soccer
{{% /example %}}

### Questions

Infinitives are great for _questions_. Because they are about general actions, instead of someone actually doing it. You don't often ask if somebody is _currently dancing_, you might ask if they know _how to dance in general_.

This is the structure:

* Use one of the interrogative verbs: *ask, decide, explain, forget, know, show, tell* and *understand* c
* Follow it with a question word (like _how_ or _why_)
* And then add the infinitive.

I've explained how questions are usually answered by repeating the structure. This remains true here.

{{% example %}}
* Do you know how **to draw** a cat? (✏️🐱)
* Has he explained when it's best **to mow** the lawn? (🌿🚜)
* No, but I've been shown how **to draw** a dog instead. (✏️🐕)
{{% /example %}}

### About style

Infinitives cause prepositions (or other glue words) to be pushed towards the _back_ of the sentence.

{{% example %}}
Do you know which team you play in?
{{% /example %}}

This is frowned upon. Glue words don't work that well when you're, well, not glueing things together, but placing it at the _end_. Communication is more clear if you **don't do this**.

How do you rewrite a sentence like that? Keep the prepositions before the thing they belong to. If necessary, add an extra word to make the sentence flow better.

{{% example %}}
Do you know **in which team** you play?
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
I've told you what to use this machine for => I've told you **for what** (purpose) to use this machine.
{{% /example %}}

It takes some effort. But it makes your communication more professional and easy to follow.

## Zero Infinitive

Fortunately, the zero infinitive has far fewer uses. 

### After modal verbs

{{% example %}}
* He can't **explain** that to you now.
* Would she **tell** you if she knew?
{{% /example %}}

### After verbs of perception

The construction here is: Verb + object + zero infinitive. The object comes between them!

{{% example %}}
* They heard her scream. 
* We watched him try to get on his bike.
{{% /example %}}

People often wrongly write "we watched him _trying_ to get on his bike". This feels correct, but it's not. 

Adding a comma also doesn't save you: "We watched him, trying to get on his bike" The subject of the sentence is _we_, so this implies that _we_ are trying to get on _his_ bike!

You'd need a small rewrites if you really want to use the -ing form: "We watched him as he was _trying_ to get on his bike."

### After specific expressions

These expressions are:

* The verbs _make_ and _let_
* The expression _had better_
* In combination with _why_, making a suggestion.

{{% example %}}
* Let's **go**! 
* You made him **do** that.
* She had better **go** to bed now. 
* You'd better **give** me some more money!
* Why **wait** until he returns? 
* Why not **sleep** at Jim's place?*
{{% /example %}}

## Imperative

The "imperative" tense is very simple and small---now that you know the infinitive. It is used to **give commands or instructions**.

{{% remark %}}
In Dutch, it's called the "gebiedende wijs", which translates to "the commanding way".
{{% /remark %}}

This is only used if you're _directly speaking_ with someone else. You won't find it in writing. And never in third person.

Let's say you planned to go to an appointment with someone else. But they are taking a lot of time to prepare. Then you say "Hurry up! We're almost late!"

The imperative is simply the verb stem, without _anything_ else!

{{% example %}}
* Find out yourself!
* Don't be so lazy.
* Wait!
{{% /example %}}

It can be used in first person (both singular and plural) by adding the word "let". The words "let us" are contracted to "let's".

{{% example %}}
* Let us go on holiday.
* Let's not talk about this again.
* Let me explain!
{{% /example %}}
