Denoting time is one of the oldest functions of a language. You know what that means by now: _irregularity_.

The way English talks about dates and time, for example, is completely dissimilar to how my own language (Dutch) talks about it. That's why I wanted to do an article on it. 

It's important and ubiquitous. But you won't quickly grasp it by reading random English text.

## Time display

Because of the digital age, most people are now used to 24-hour clocks. 

These are written as: **hours:minutes** The hours go from 00-24. The minutes from 00-60.

English, however, commonly divides the day into two halves of 12 hours. 

* The first half is called "AM": after midnight. 
* The second half is called "PM": pre midnight, or _before midnight_

Midnight is the point at which the new day starts. So it isn't that strange to use it as the division point.

{{% example %}}
* 13:56 would be 1:56 PM.
* 08:29 would be 08:29 AM.
* 22:12 would be 10:12 PM
{{% /example %}}

## Times of day

Here's an overview of what each time of day is called.

* Anything until around 12:00 is _morning_. (ðŸ•›)
* 12:00 is called _midday_ or _noon_
* From 12:00 to 18:00 is called _afternoon_ (ðŸ••)
* From 18:00 to 24:00 is called _evening_
* 24:00 is called _midnight_ (ðŸ•›)
* And around those hours is therefore the _night_, but the boundaries aren't clear.

When the sun comes up, it's called _dawn_ or _sunrise_. When the sun goes down again, it's called _dusk_ or _sunset_.

## Clock

To communicate this time, you can simply say it out loud. "05:30 PM" is "five thirty PM".

But that often isn't ideal. Especially when working with a _physical clock_, we switch to a different method.

Full hours are called **\<hour\> o'clock**. This is an abbreviation of "on the clock".

{{% example %}}
It's 5 o'clock. (ðŸ•”)
{{% /example %}}

Any other times are usually stated _relative to the full hour_. You first find the closest full hour. Then base the time on that.

* If you're on the left side, you are _before_ the full hour, and use the word **to**
* If you're on the right side, you are _after_ the full hour, and use the word **past**

{{% example %}}
* 05:20 => It's 20 minutes **past** 5 (o'clock).
* 12:56 => It's 4 minutes **to** 1 (o'clock)
{{% /example %}}

We have shorthands for common distances: 

* 30 minutes is **half** (as it is half a full hour)
* 15 minutes is **quarter** (as it is 1/4 of a full hour)

{{% example %}}
* 03:15 PM => It's a quarter past three _in the afternoon_
* 20:30 => It's half past eight _in the evening_ (ðŸ•£)
* 00:15 => It's a quarter past midnight

## Dates

Dates have three components: the **day**, the **month** and the **year**.

Again, the digital age made most people familiar with the quickstyle: "day / month / year" 

This is fine for notes, but should not be used in (formal) writing.

### Year

Everyone agrees that the **year** should come last. You should never even _start_ a sentence with a year. In general, i's confusing and poor style to start sentences with numbers.

{{% example %}}
2020 saw a widespread global pandemic => The year 2020 saw a widespread global pandemic.
{{% /example %}}

If you write about a century ( = period of 100 years), add an **"s"** (without apostrophe!). 

If you write about a decennium ( = period of 10 years), do the same, but add an apostrophe (`'`) **at the start**.

{{% example %}}
* In the 1800s, the industrial revolution began.
* The '80s saw many extraordinary haircuts and clothing styles.
{{% /example %}}

### Day and month

Everyone agrees about the year. But the day and the month? They can be in any order.

You can write them **with a ranking number**. In that case, use the ranking form for the _day_, and write the month in _full_.

{{% example %}}
I was born on the 18th **of** February.
{{% /example %}}

You can also write them **without a ranking number**, if you leave out the "of".

{{% example %}}
* I was born February 18.
* I was born 18 February, 1997.
{{% /example %}}

In any case, the year (if included) comes last and needs a comma before it.
