English has become *the* language of the world. Learning it will help you communicate clearly with basically anyone. It's not just a useful skill, it's almost an _essential_ skill.

On many of my projects, the whole group spoke _Dutch_. Still we were required to communicate in English! Because every programming language is in English. Because all the information was on the internet, in English. Because our universities exclusively used it.

This course will teach you the **grammar**. 

**Not** how to write a good story. **Not** how to spell words. **Not** where to place punctuation. Those are taught in other courses, like [Prose](../../creative-writing/prose/).

It's all about grammar. How to construct a sentence. How to communicate whatever you want to say. How to combine words into a meaningful English sentence.

Yes, this course itself is also in English. I try to write as _simply as possible_. Short sentences, easy words. I also add simple icons/emojis to examples.

But _some_ reading experience with English is helpful. This course explains everything, but isn't as basic as some other courses.

You should view it as an easy introduction. Or a reminder of all the rules. Something that might fill gaps in your knowledge. A guide you can look up if you've forgotten something. (That's also why there's an easy _cheat sheet_ at the end.)

One factor that led to English becoming the global language, is probably its easy grammar. This course is quite short---with sometimes tiny chapters---yet you won't miss a thing!

At the same time, though, English has a huge vocabulary. There are often lots of ways to say the same thing in English. Or to say something with _subtle_ differences.

Again, my mother tongue is _Dutch_. And I'm in the situation _all the time_ where I just can't say something in Dutch, while English has 5 perfectly fine expressions for it.

You will only learn the fine details (and many words) by _reading_ and _writing_ a lot yourself. This course is all about grammar.

I hope you find it useful!
