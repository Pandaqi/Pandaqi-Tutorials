Adverbs are the wildcard of any language. They can be *formed* out of anything and *applied* to nearly everything. They are the last piece of our puzzle. The last question to answer.

* The subject and object (nouns + adjectives) answer the question **Who?** 
* The verb answers the question **What?**
* Relative clauses usually answer the question **Why?**

Adverbs try to answer the remaining questions: **When?** **Where?** and **How?**

> **Adverbs** modify a verb, adjective or other adverb. They can be a _word_ or a _phrase_.

{{% example %}}
* He lived **happily** ever after.
* She **angrily** threw away her food.
* The test went **very well**.
{{% /example %}}

You can find adverbs by rephrasing a sentence in interrogative form:

> Mark loudly sang the beautifully composed song there.

* How did Mark sing? **Loudly**
* How was the song composed? **Beautifully**
* Where did Mark sing? **There**

As you can see, adverbs are everywhere. But they rarely stand on their own in a sentence. They modify what already exists.

* If they modify a verb, they are usually placed after it. 
* If they modify an adjective, they are placed in front of it.
* If they are a phrase, it's usually pushed to the end of the sentence

## Forming Adverbs

Adverbs are constructed from _adjectives_. So start with an adjective. 

Because adjectives end in all sorts of letters, however, there are _many_ rules for this. Remember that these rules merely exist to make the word easier to read and speak. If a word sounds fine using just the first rule, it's probably fine.

In most cases, add a **-ly** behind it and you're done.

{{% example %}}
Quick => Quick**ly**
{{% /example %}}

The adjective ends in an **-y**? Replace it with an **-i**. (We've seen this exact rule many times now, throughout this course.)

{{% example %}}
Easy => Eas**ily**
{{% /example %}}

The adjective ends in **-able, -ible** or **-le**? Replace the **-e** with an **-i**.

{{% example %}}
Terrible => Terr**ibly**
{{% /example %}}

The adjective ends in **-ic**? Add **-ally** at the end.

{{% example %}}
* Basic => Basic**ally**
* Cryptic => Cryptically
* *Exception!* Public => publicly
{{% /example %}}

## Irregular adverbs

Some common adjectives stay the same as adverbs.

> Early, fast, hard, high, late, near, straight, and wrong

{{% example %}}
She always drives very **fast**. (Wrong: She always drives very fastly ❌)
{{% /example %}}

And finally, a _very_ common irregular adverb. The adverb of **good** is **well**.

{{% example %}}
She is a good soccer player => She plays **well** (Wrong: She plays good. ❌)
{{% /example %}}

## Comparative and Superlative Adverb

Adverbs end in **-ly**. By now, you know English likes replacing that "y" with an "i" when something comes after it. 

And indeed, you _can_ do that with the _comparative_ and _superlative_ form. Add **-ier** and **-iest** to the end.

{{% example %}}
She spoke gentlier than him. They sang loudliest of all.
{{% /example %}}

However! This leads to long or clunky words with many syllables. As such, the most common (and better) approach is to use the other rule for comparing: just place **more** and **most** in front.

{{% example %}}
Slowly => More slowly => Most slowly
{{% /example %}}

Very short adverbs, especially the irregular ones that don't change, are _always_ formed in the usual way:

{{% example %}}
Fast => Faster => Fastest
{{% /example %}}

## Relative Adverbs

Adverbs can help glue a short sentence to another one. 

The full way to write this uses **(in/at/on/for) + which**.

{{% example %}}
* A rain storm happened on the day **on which** she was born
* We don't know the reason **for which** he left.
{{% /example %}}

Often, you can shorten such a sentence. Do this with *relative adverbs*: **where, when** or **why**.

{{% example %}}
* A rain storm happened on the day **when** she was born
* We don't know the reason **why** he left.
{{% /example %}}

If the glue sentence is simple enough, you can leave it out entirely.

{{% example %}}
* A rain storm happened on the day she was born.
* We don't know the reason he left.

That last sentence is quite common, but _not recommended_. It introduces vagueness. "The reason he left" could also mean that he left behind a note stating a reason. It feels like this sentence misses a word, and it does.
{{% /example %}}

## Interrogative Adverbs

We've talked about the big questions: *who, what, where, when, why* and *how*.

Now we can give them a name: *interrogative adverbs*.

* Place them at the beginning of a sentence. 
* Switch the subject and verb
* And you have a question!

{{% example %}}
* **How** often do you shave?
* **Where** did he suddenly come from?
* **What** time is it?
{{% /example %}}

The word *how* is a bit abstract. There are four typical ways in which it is used:

-   When it means *in what way.* => *How do you repair a bike?*
-   To ask about degree/severeness of an adjective => *How old do you think he is?*
-   To ask about degree/frequency of an action => *How fast did he run!?*
-   With *much* and *many* to ask about quantity => *How much time did you put into this assignment?*

## English remarks, again

Early on, I mentioned the tendency of English to include (opinionated) remarks. Just a tiny word or sentence, surrounded by a comma (`,`) or dash (`–`), to give some judgement or viewpoint on a sentence.

Now we can complete the circle on this. They are _commenting adverbs_. They come at the start or the end. Sometimes, but rarely, they appear directly around the main verb.

{{% example %}}
* **Clearly,** she doesn't know what she's talking about. (The writer's opinion is that _she_, the subject, doesn't know what she's doing.)
* They are the ones to blame, **obviously** (The writer is so sure of their opinion, that they have to mention it is obvious.)
* He has **undoubtedly** prepared well.
{{% /example %}}

## Adverbials

When an adverb is a _phrase_ or _clause_, some like to call it an _adverbial_. (To make this distinction clear.)

In this case, it has the same function: modify the sentence. But it's a phrase because we simply need _multiple words_ to do so.

{{% example %}}
He was still sick. => why? => He was still sick **from dinner last Friday**.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
She played soccer. => When? => She played soccer **when she was young**.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
They spoke. => How? => They spoke **in an angry voice**.
{{% /example %}}

You can turn the order around. "When she was young, she played soccer." But this isn't recommended. Because it makes the sentence harder to read: the subject + verb now come at the _end_. They are the most important parts and should be communciated early!

## Overview

You've learned how to modify adjectives into adverbs. You've learned where to place them, when they can shorten a sentence, and when you can omit them altogether.

All that's left is learning the types of adverbs available. Again, see this as a _reference_. Don't try to memorize this. Just skip through, come back when you're looking for a specific word to use.

This doesn't list all adverbs. (That'd be impossible. There are thousands and thousands of them!) It lists the different groups, the common words in them, and where to place them in a sentence.

### Adverbs of Place

Most common are **here** (something nearby) and **there** (something far away). 

Those are usually placed at the end of the sentence or after prepositions. When put at the front, they are an exclamation or receive emphasis. 

In the [Pronouns](../pronouns/) chapter we also discussed the important **everywhere, anywhere, somewhere** and **nowhere**.

In the [Prepositions](../prepositions/) chapter you already saw them categorized by _time_, _place_ and _movement_. So it's not surprising that **some prepositions can be an adverb as well!**

| Word       | Used as adverb                        | Used as preposition
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------
| *around*   | He came around very often those days.          | It was placed around the hearth.
| *behind*   | He was falling behind the others.              | He hid behind the rocks.
| *down*     | He fell down.                                  | She ran down the road.
| *in*       | He decided to jump in to save the situation.   | The postman dropped letters in the mailbox.
| *off*      | I want to get off at the next stop.            | He fell off the balcony.
| *on*       | They cycled on for a few more hours.           | She placed all her books on the table.
| *over*     | She turned over twice before falling asleep.   | The picture still hangs over my bed.

{{% remark %}}
It doesn't work in all cases. Adverbs and prepositions are clearly distinct word types. They simply have some overlap in this important area.
{{% /remark %}}

### Adverbs of Time

There are three adverbs of time: *how long > how often > when (exactly)*. 

If you use multiple, they should always be in that order. 

**Time follows place in a sentence**. Unless you intend to emphasize one of them. (Which is used in poems, novels or speeches.) But keep it simple and straightforward otherwise.

**How long:** *often, never, always, seldom, rarely, frequently, regularly, usually, once a week, monthly, ...*

**How often:** *all day, for weeks, for years, since Tuesday, ...*

**When:** *yesterday, tomorrow, today, later, now, last year, next year, ...*

The word **yet** is used in questions and negative sentences: if something hasn't happened, but is expected to happen.

{{% example %}}
Have you finished that project **yet**?
{{% /example %}}

The word **still** expresses continuity. It is mostly used in positive sentences. It is placed before the main verb. But if the main verb is an _auxiliary verb_, it comes _after_ it.

{{% example %}}
*I still like the same songs.
*He is still in love with you.
{{% /example %}}

### Adverbs of Manner

Adverbs of manner tell how something happened. "Manner" is another word for "the way the action happens". Most adverbs that modify a _verb_ fall in this category.

For example: *well, quickly, patiently, greedily, softly, beautifully, angrily, roughly, ...*

You can always place an _adverb of manner_ at the end of a sentence, so it modifies the action of the whole sentence.

But ... 

* If the sentence is long, or has many verbs, place the adverb _behind the verb to which it applies_. This avoids confusion.
* If the sentence has an object (direct or indirect), place the adverb in front of that. Again, to avoid confusion.

Some adverbs always come immediately after the verb: *well, badly, hard* and *fast*.

### Adverbs of Degree

These tell us about the intensity or degree of an action. They are placed directly before whatever they are modifying.

The adverb **very** makes an adverb or adjective stronger. The word *too* says there is a problem (things have gone too far). The word *very* simply states a fact. 

**Not very** is used to reverse this: instead of making something stronger, it makes it weaker.

{{% example %}}
It was very bad => It wasn't very good
{{% /example %}}

The adverb **too** can have two very different meanings:

-   Same as _also_. Placed at the end => *I like swimming **too**!*
-   Same as _excessively_. Place before what it modifies => *Am I **too** fat?*

The adverb **enough** comes *after* what it modifies. It means something like "to the necessary degree".

{{% example %}}
* He didn't do enough to pass the exam. 
* But it was enough for me. 
* Now I have enough points to get my diploma.
{{% /example %}}

This can also express a quantity: *as much/many as necessary*. 

It is often followed by *for someone*, *for something* or *"to"+infinitive*.

### Adverbs of Certainty

Express how certain we feel about an event or action. 

* Always put before the main verb. 
* Unless that verb is some form of **to be**. 

These are: *certainly, definitely, probably, undoubtedly, surely*

{{% example %}}
* I definitely like pizza.
* You are definitely a hero.
* They will surely find the answer.
