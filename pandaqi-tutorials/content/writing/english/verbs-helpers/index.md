Last chapter you learned about verbs. How they match their subject and the timing of the sentence. And how easy it is to use the infinitive to create the **simple present**: an action that happens now.

Instead of modifying the verb too much, English likes adding _other verbs_ in front of one. Below are just examples. The other tenses are explained in later chapters.

{{% example %}}
* I walk => I _**have** walked_ (past)
* You see => You _**will** see_ (future)
* We speak => We _**have been** speaking_ for a while now (started in the past, still going on)
{{% /example %}}

## Auxiliary verbs

As you saw in the example, these will _help_ you form the other tenses.

They can also be used on their own. In fact, you'll see they are very common! So let's start simple and only look at them on their own.

{{% remark %}}
Remember, different versions of the same word are called "conjugations". We say the verb is "conjugated" to match the rest of the sentence. I won't use the word often, as it's not an easy one. But you'll find it everywhere when articles talk about grammer.

### Present

| \-                  | to be       | to do       | to have     |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| I                   | am          | do          | have        |
| You                 | are         | do          | have        |
| He/she/it           | is          | does        | has         |
| We                  | are         | do          | have        |
| You                 | are         | do          | have        |
| They                | are         | do          | have        |

{{% example %}}
* I am angry. (😡)
* They do a dance. (🕺💃)
* We have a cow. (👪 🐄)
{{% /example %}}

### Past

These are used when something isn't happening now, but happened some time ago---in the _past_.

|  \-                 | to be    | to do    | to have   |  
| ------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----- |
| I                   | was      | did      | had |
| You                 | were     | did      | had |
| He/she/it           | was      | did      |  had |
| We                  | were     | did      | had |
| You                 | were     | did      | had |
| They                | were     | did      | had |
| *Past participle*   | been     | done     | had |

Don't worry about the "past participle" for now.

{{% example %}}
* I was angry _yesterday_
* They did a dance _this morning_
* We had a cow _when I was younger_
{{% /example %}}

## Modal Verbs

Modal verbs are special types of auxiliary verbs. They **can not** stand on their own. They must always support the actual main verb.

They show an obligation, possibility or necessity. What does that mean?

Without them, any action you describe _happens_ and is _true_. 

{{% example %}}
"The boy eats bread" is a statement. The boy eats, that is certain.
{{% /example %}}

With a **modal verb**, the action is suddenly only _possible_. It's uncertain. The action itself might not happen. You are talking _about_ the main action _maybe happening_. 

{{% example %}}
"The boy might eat bread". Now we're not sure if he eats ... but he might!
{{% /example %}}

They only have a single form that never changes. When used, the main verb also doesn't change anymore. (See the example above. It's "the boy might eat bread", not "the boy might eat**s** bread".)

All modal verbs are:

| | | |
| ------------|------------------------------------------| ------------| ------------------------ |
| **can**     | you have the ability to do something     |  **could**  |  you had the ability sometime in the past |
| **may**     |  you are allowed or will maybe do something  | **might** |  you are _maybe_ allowed to do something, or could perhaps do it |
| **must**    | you are obliged to do something, or it's likely to be done  | **ought** |  it's likely, expected or "the right thing" to do something |
| **should**  | you strongly advice or insist on doing something  |  **would** | if you had the possibility or opportunity, you would have done the action |

These will become clear once you use and read them more. Study the examples below.

{{% example %}}
* I **can** write code and make websites
* When I was young, I **could** stay up all night.
* **May** I please come inside?
* If you work hard, you **might** get into a top university.
* You **must** submit your homework before Friday!
* You **ought** to be honest and tell the truth.
* They **should** fix this issue with their app.
* I **would** visit Disneyland if I had the money.
{{% /example %}}

Just remember that these modify the _possibility_ or _probability_ of an action. If you communicate an action that isn't _certain_ or _definitely true_, it probably needs a modal verb before the main verb.

## The last modal verb

I left out one modal verb, on purpose. It's a special one.

The verb **will** always indicates a **future action**. 

{{% remark %}}
It actually has a large number of meanings and functions. But those are discussed in chapters about future tenses.
{{% /remark %}}

The word is always written as **will**, no variations. I will, you will, he will, etcetera. 

{{% example %}}
*I will do my homework* => you're not doing it now, but in the future you will do your homework
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
*They will go to school* => not now, but in the future they will go to school
{{% /example %}}

The verb **shall** means the same, but is older and less used nowadays.
