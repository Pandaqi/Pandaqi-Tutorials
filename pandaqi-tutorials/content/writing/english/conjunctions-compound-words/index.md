This course taught you all the small, individual pieces that make up a language. You've also seen ways to combine and modify them: using prepositions, adverbs, pronouns.

But still ... almost all example sentences are short statements that say only one thing. All examples I gave of adjectives and adverbs are equally short and simple.

That's because we're still missing two big ways to combine pieces in English:

* **Compound words**: stitching multiple *words* into one
* **Conjunctions**: stitching multiple _sentences_ (or _clauses_) into one

## Compound words

At the start, you learned how to make very small sentences. Then I explained how you can combine them, like LEGO blocks, to build longer and more advanced sentences.

Now you know a whole lot of words. And you're ready for the good news: the same can be done with words! 

When you combine multiple words into one, it's called a **compound word**.

Three types exist ...

* **Closed**: stitch the words together like one word. (Police + man = policeman)
* **Open**: keep a space between them. (Living + room = living room)
* **Hyphenated**: place a hyphen between them. (Long + term = long-term)

### Closed

These evolve over time. As people start putting two words together, more and more, they eventually become a new single word.

They are almost always made from _two_ words, never more. They usually have the form **adjective** + **noun**.

{{% example %}}
Book + store = bookstore. (What kind of store? One that sells books.)
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
Boy + friend = boyfriend. (Wat kind of friend? One that's a boy.)
{{% /example %}}

These don't work for for two words that are _hard to read or pronounce_ when combined. Bookstore is fine. But a store that sells shirts? A shirtsstore isn't great, and shirtstore reads almost like a different type of store ... ðŸ’©

### Open

These are also usually **adjective** + **noun**. But they can also be an **adverb** (ending in -ly) + **noun**.

{{% example %}}
* Water + tank = water tank
* Washing + machine = washing machine
* Website + builder = website builder
* Newly + formed = newly formed
{{% /example %}}

Even though the words are seperate, we _still_ call it a compound word. Because the combination of the words points to a single meaning. You want to convey them as a single concept, not the separate meanings of the two words. So it's regarded as _one_ compound word.

### Hyphenated

The rules, here, are complex and not exact. Consult a dictionary if you're not sure.

In general, you hyphenate when the two rules above don't apply. For example, for the combination **noun** + **verb**. Or when the compound word is supposed to be an adjective for _another_ noun.

{{% example %}}
* Train + spotting = train-spotting; noun + verb
* Off + campus = off-campus; preposition + noun
* Long + term = long-term; can be placed before something ("a long-term solution")
* Oft + debated = oft-debated
{{% /example %}}


## Conjunctions

Conjunctions are short words connecting (parts of) *sentences*. 

_Why not just keep the sentences separate?_ For two reasons:

* It allows variety and flow, instead of your writing feeling stiff and basic.
* It shows a **relationship** between the sentences.

{{% example %}}
It was a snowy day, **so** I stayed inside.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
We wanted to buy fries, **but** we had no money.
{{% /example %}}

Note, in all the examples, how the words combine two separate sentences. 

* "We wanted to buy fries" can stand on its own. (It has a subject and verb.)
* "We had no money" is also fine on its own. (It has a subject and verb.)

The _conjunction_ merely allows the two to be combined. And it gives extra information: we _can't_ buy the fries, _because_ we have no money.

Four types exist, which I will discuss seperately.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

Used to join ... 

* Individual words or short phrases
* *Independent* clauses ( = a clause that could be a sentence on its own).

Usually placed in the middle of a sentence, and with a comma before it. 

They are: *And, but, or, nor, yet, so, for* 

{{% example %}}
* Should Me **and** Mike go fishing **or** go swimming? 
* She was sad, **for** her cat just died.
{{% /example %}}

### Subordinating Conjunctions

Introduce *dependant* clauses. These but "depend on" the main sentence to mean something.

{{% example %}}
* I want to sing, **before** I lose my voice.
* They will sing with you, **assuming** they know the words.
* We can't come, **because** we have a birthday to attend.
* **As long as** you don't touch anything, we should be fine.
{{% /example %}}

Note the dependancy. "I lose my voice" is incorrect on its own and doesn't mean anything. (You could say "I'm losing my voice") But combined with "I want to sing" + conjunction, it gets meaning and is valid.

We identify many types ...


| Condition            | Time                  | Relative Adjective    | Relative Pronoun |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------| -------------- |
| lest                  | after                 | that                  | who |
| in case (that)        | as long as            | what                  | whoever |
| even if               | as soon as            | whatever              | whom |
| assuming that         | before                | which                 | whomever |
| if                    | by the time           | whichever             | whose |
| only if               | till                  |                       |
| unless                | now that              |                       |
| until                 | until                 |                       |
| provided that         | once                  |                       |
|                       | when                  |                       |
|                       | since                 |                       |
|                       | whenever              |                       |
|                       | while                 |                       |


| Comparison            | Reason                | Manner                | Place    | Concession |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------| -----    | ----------|
| than                  | because               | how                   | where    | though |
| rather than           | since                 | as though             | wherever | although |
| whether               | so that               | as if                 |          | even |
| as much as            | in order (that)       |                       |          | while |
| whereas               | why                   |                       |          |

### Correlative Conjunctions

These come in pairs. They _compare_ two ideas expressed in different parts of the sentence. 

They are very similar to comparative nouns. ("He was **as** tall **as** a tree.")

|                       |                       |                       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| as ... as             | either ... or         | what with ... and     |
| just as ... so        | neither ... or        | whether ... or        |
| both ... and          | if ... then           | not only ... but also |
| hardly ... when       | not ... but           | no sooner ... than    |
| scarcely ... when     |                       | rather ... than       |

{{% example %}}
You can **either** come with me, or **stay at home**
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
It was **scarcely** winter, **when** the first snow started to fall.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
**Not only** is a holiday into the jungle dangerous, **but also** expensive!
{{% /example %}}

### Conjunctive Adverbs

These also link two ideas. But with two differences ...

* They stand on their own
* They don't necessarily compare; they can also just expand or give more options

They are basically variations on *and, but* and *so*. 

| *Similar to **And***  | *Similar to **But***  | *Similar to **So***   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| also                  | however               | accordingly           |
| besides               | nevertheless          | consequently          |
| furthermore           | nonetheless           | hence                 |
| likewise              | still                 | meanwhile             |
| moreover              | conversely            | then                  |
|                       | instead               | therefore             |
|                       | otherwise             | thus                  |
|                       | rather                |                       |

Because they stand on their own, you can start a sentence with them. You know I like short sentences, which is why I recommend this. Nevertheless, they can also be a conjunction to combine two phrases into one.

{{% example %}}
We were friends, **therefore** we went everywhere together.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
I don't like apples. **Furthermore**, I think bananas are weird.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
I hate mathematics, but can do arithmetic easily **nonetheless**.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
They were ill-prepared. **Consequently,** their holiday was an utter disaster.

Or as one sentence: They were ill-prepared and, consequently, their holiday was an utter disaster.
{{% /example %}}
