Let's start with the absolute basics. Grammar is all about creating _sentences_ with meaning, by putting _words_ in the right order. (And sometimes the right spelling.)

Without sentences, language would become a never-ending mess of words:

> the apple tree fell ground shone grass was green the on sun the from

As such, a sentence is meant to group words to _make a point_. Ideally, each sentence should say _one thing_, and then end. If you want to talk about something else, start a new sentence. 

Start with a capital letter (`A` instead of `a`) and end with a full stop (`.`). Like this:

> Fell tree from the apple the ground the to. Shone grass on the sun the.

But wait, that's still unreadable, right? What does this mean? The second step to grammar is putting words in the right **order** within a sentence. Like this:

> The apple fell from the tree to the ground. The sun shone on the grass.

That's all grammar is. It uses the vocabulary of a language to tell you how to _group_ and _order_ words.

To help with this, words have different roles within a sentence. These first chapters will explain the most important word roles.

## Subject and Verb

Every sentence needs these.

* **Subject?** What or who is doing something
* **Verb?** What the subject is actually doing.

{{% example %}}
The man eats. (👨 🍽️)

**The man** is the subject. He is the one doing something. What he does is **eat**ing, the verb.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
The dog runs. (🐕 🏃‍♀️)

**The dog** is the subject. What is he doing? **Running**, the verb.
{{% /example %}}

If you create a sentence and can't find the subject and/or verb, something went wrong.

Every language around the world needs these two elements. For some reason, humans can only communicate in sentences where _something happens_ and _somebody is doing that_. 

{{% example %}}
We say "it rains" (☔). We don't just say "RAIN!" or "WATER!" 

Even though nobody is making that rain happen. And all we care about is that water is falling from the sky. We _still_ add a subject and a verb to that sentence.
{{% /example %}}

The subject comes right before the verb. This is _not_ a strict rule, but it's good writing advice. As humans understand a language better, we tend to complicate our sentences, moving verb and subject all over the place. Try _not_ to do that. It makes your communication easier to follow.

## Negation

This little rule is typically English. That's why I explain it so early.

All sentences above are _true_. "The man is old" is what it is. 

But what if we want to communicate that something is false? What if we want to turn it around? What if it is actually a _young_ man?

We can "negate" the sentence by adding the word **not**.

{{% example %}}
The man is **not** old. (👨❌👴)

The girl is **not** a book. (👧❌📖)

Your pet is **not** a dog. (❌🐕)
{{% /example %}}

This word should come right before the thing it negates. That's a prime example of grammar! 

If you placed the `not` anywhere else, the reader wouldn't know _what_ was negated. So grammar adds a rule about the order of your words.

Think about language that way. Not "strict annoying rules to remember", but "rules to help communicate better and without mistakes".

Throughout this course, you'll see many _contractions_. Contraction means to "make smaller" or "pull together". That's when you combine a _verb_ and _not_, like ...

{{% example %}}
* Does not => does**n't**. 
* Is not => is**n't**.
* Would not => would**n't**
{{% /example %}}

These contractions are what make English so small and compact. They are used a lot. Once you get used to them, you'll also use them without thinking. (See that? You + will = you'll.)

Once we get to the chapters on verbs, I will explain them more in-depth.
