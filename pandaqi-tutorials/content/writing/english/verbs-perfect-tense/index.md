We have seen two tenses so far. Those are the building blocks of English:

* Simple tense: for general truths or predictions about present, past and future
* Continuous tense: for actual specific actions happening at a clear point in time (present, past or future)

What's missing? Something that _happened_ but is now _done_. Continuous might talk about something that started and is still going on. Perfect talks about something that used to be going on, but is now _over_.

This is the **perfect** tense. No, it's not because the grammar is "beautiful" or "the best". It's because "perfect" is the Latin word for "complete".

This tense is more difficult than the others, though! You can get by fine with the *simple* and *continuous*. We're going into the advanced grammar here. It's okay to take a break and practice the other tenses first.

Because anything that is _done_ ... could have started in a number of ways. Which means there are **6** variations of the perfect tense!

> **Perfect** tense is for _completed_ actions. They started and happened before the time in the sentence, and they are completed now. (Can also mean one "instance" of the action is completed, but the action itself continues.)

## The participle

For this tense, we need another way to write our verb. This is called the **past participle**.

Yes, that is the mysterious word you saw in the tables for auxiliary verbs! 

* To be => past participle is **been**
* To do => past participle is **done**
* To have => past particiepl is **had**

Now you finally use it.

{{% remark %}}
In Dutch, this is called the "voltooid deelwoord", which translates to "completed wordpart". That's a much easier way to remember it than the word "participle".
{{% /remark %}}

For most verbs, the **past participle** is the same as the **past** version. Slap a **"-(e)d"** at the end and you're done.

For irregular verbs, this is different. That's why they are irregular. In general, though, those will ... 

* Either end with **-(e)n**. ("I spoke" => "I have spoken.")
* Or be identical to the regular form. ("I read a book" => "I have read a book". This verb is both _present_ and _past participle_.)

## Simple Present Perfect

Constructed using **to have** (present form) + **past participle**.

{{% example %}}
* I **have lived** here all my life.
* They **have been** to the zoo twice this week.
* We **have been** to the zoo several times. 
* She **has** just **finished** reading the book. 
* He **has read** the Hobbit thrice.
{{% /example %}}

Use it for:

-   A repeated or continuous action. So it is "completed" regularly. ("I have cycled all my life" means you've started and finished the act of cycling numerous times in your life.)
-   A repeated action without a clear indication of time. ("We have been to the zoo several times". The action is _done_. You're already back from each of those trips. But it's not clear when you went to the zoo exactly.)
-   An action that was completed in very recent past. (When the word **just** is added.)
-   An action when the time is not important, but the *result*.
-   An action that is completed, but the period in which it happens is still going on. ("I have thought about Christmas all year." The action of _thinking about Christmas_ is done, many times actually. But we're still in the same year, and that's what's important.)

## Continuous Present Perfect

Constructed with **to have** + **been** + **continuous verb form**.

It's used for actions that started an unspecified time *before now* and are still going on in the present.

{{% example %}}
* I **have been cycling** to school every day for years. (You started cycling to school long ago. But tomorrow? Yeah, you're cycling to school again.)
* She **has been waiting** for him all day. (When exactly did she start waiting? We don't know! But she's still waiting.)
* They **have been kissing** for an hour now.
{{% /example %}}

It can also be used for actions that have just finished, and we are interested in the results.

{{% example %}}
It's been raining since last night (... which means the streets are still wet)
{{% /example %}}

_But, didn't you say this was for "completed" actions?_ Yes, this distinction is quite subtle. It might take a while to grasp.

Let's look at the example above: "I have been cycling to school every day for years"

The nouns at the end, which indicate time, are vital. Without them, you'd use a different tense. Without them, the whole sentence would be in a different time:

* I was cycling to school, when ... => an ongoing action in the past, so _continuous tense_
* I cycled to school for years => a general habit from the past, so _simple tense_

So what makes this different? Those days, those _years_, are already completed. You've been cycling every day, and all those days are in the past and _completed_. That's why you use perfect tense.

Try to remember it that way. Whenever a sentence mentions a _time period_ that is completed, repeated, or in the past, the tense changes to _perfect tense_. If you leave out those nouns, the tense changes with it.

## Simple Past Perfect

Constructed using a **to have** (past form) + **past participle**.

{{% example %}}
* Jessy **had printed** the papers that morning.
* Mark **had** already **left** when I arrived.
* See **had** just **saved** the document when the computer crashed.
{{% /example %}}

What's the difference with the "Simple Present Perfect"? I mean, that one alread talked about actions that started or completed before now?

This one goes _back even further_. The whole sentence is in the past, because of nouns that indicate this. Notice how each of the examples uses a time indication: "that morning", "when I arrived", "when the computer crashed".

Something happened in the past. Another thing happened _before that_. 

That's how this tense is usually used. To make clear one event happened before another in the past.

### Continuous Past Perfect

Constructed using **to have** (past form) + **been** + **continuous form**.

{{% example %}}
We **had been trying** to contact him, but we were unable to reach him.
{{% /example %}}

Again, this is the same as the continuous present, but _even earlier_. The whole sentence is in the past, so the moment _before that_ is "even more in the past".

The example sentence could be rewritten to:

{{% example %}}
We were unable to reach him, after we **had been trying** to contact him. *(Even earlier, they already tried contacting him)*
{{% /example %}}

This tense is often used in *reported speech*. Somebody is talking about an event in the past. And in that event, another statement is made about what happened _before that_. (In a sense, the perfect tense is about "the past before the past".)

{{% example %}}
"I have been working in my office all day," Mark told the police.

Mark told the police that he **had been working** in his office all day.
{{% /example %}}

## Simple Future Perfect

Constructed using **will have** + **past participle**.

{{% example %}}
* By Monday, they will have arrived at the hotel.
* By the time you read this, I will have left this world.
* He will have signed the papers after the meeting on Friday.
{{% /example %}}

Use it to refer to a point in the future when an action is completed. We place ourselves in the future---and we see that a certain action is now done or finished!

## Continuous Future Perfect

Constructed using **will have been** + **continuous form**.

{{% example %}}
By 2016, I **will have been living** in Manchester for five years.
{{% /example %}}

As expected, this is the same as the simple tense. But now the action in the future is _still going on_. It's true now and it will be true in the future.

But remember, this is the _perfect_ tense. So it's only used if the sentence also contains a time indication that indicates this is a repeated action, completed regularly.

The example above could be written in other tenses:

* I will live in Manchester! => it's not true now, but it's a spontaneous promise or decision for the future
* I will be living in Manchester for all of 2016 => in an upcoming time period, the action of living there will be ongoing
* If I die tomorrow, I will have lived in Manchester all my life => once dead, the action of "living" doesn't continue anymore, so it's not continuous

{{% example %}}
Next week, I will have been living with Sarah for two years.

Next week is a clear point in the future. Once there, you've completed two years of living with Sarah, but you haven't *stopped* living with her. Hopefully.
