In this course, I've often left remarks about the best way to write things. I find this important. Language is about communication, so let's see how to improve that communication as much as possible.

I've told you:

* To use active voice, instead of passive.
* To modify words so they are easy to read or pronounce
* To pick the _shortest_ way of writing something. (Usually by picking the right verb and tense, plus using a lot of referencing.)

This article continues that thought. It's about common _mistakes_, but also about simply _writing better_. Communicating better. Using the right words for the right job. Many expressions mentioned here are grammatically correct---maybe even popular---but should be restricted to speech.

Because what's the point of learning a language ... if you only use it for vague and imprecise communication?

I've sorted the mistakes on type. You can disagree with me on these topics! It's merely advice. My thoughts on how to communicate better.

## Intensifiers

This category holds words that intensify other words. And explains why they are often a bad idea.

### Absolutely

Often redundant when used to emphasize adjectives. Either someone is honest, or he isn't. Absolutely honest doesn't make him more honest.

This is a general rule: instead of using "very" or "absolutely" to intensify something, try to find a _stronger_ verb or noun. "Absolutely cold" is simply "freezing". "Absolutely scary" is "frightening".

### Amazing

Overused. Omit it, or at least find a more fitting synonym. If everything is amazing, nothing is.

### Certainly

Used too often to intensify any and every statement. Remembe rthe general rule: find _one_ word that says what you want precisely.

### Really

Similar to "*very*". Don't use it to modify an adjective, verb or adverb. (At least, not often.) Find a stronger version of the word instead.

### So

Avoid using it as an intensifier (*so good* or *so strong*).

### Very

Use sparingly to exaggerate nouns. If emphasis is necessary, find a strong word.

{{% example %}}
* Very tired => morose
* Very happy => ecstatic
* Very good => skillful, expert, unparalleled, whatever
{{% /example %}}

## Unnecessary

These words are fine, but often _unnecessary_. Removing them makes communication only shorter and clearer.

### Always

If you say something, it is by default _always true_. For example: "When you add 2 and 2, you get 4."

There is _no need_ to say: "When you add 2 and 2, you ALWAYS get 4."

Similarly, "I always go to the gym on Wednesdays" is the same as simply "I go to the gym on Wednesdays".

As such, this word can be removed 99% of the time.

### As to whether

Just *whether* is sufficient. 

{{% example %}}
I like your idea. As to whether we should spend so much money on it, though ...

I like your idea. Whether we should spend so much money on it, though ...
{{% /example %}}

### Case

Usually unnecessary in these cases:

* Instance of a thing occurring
* Usual state of affairs

{{% example %}}
In many cases, the houses had been destroyed => Many houses had been destroyed.
{{% /example %}}

### Character

Often redundant and used out of habit only.

{{% example %}}
Acts of a hostile character => Hostile acts
{{% /example %}}

### Clever

Overused. Best restricted to ingenuity displayed in small matters. If something is really clever, it should _show_ through the consequences or writing about it.

### Dependable

A needless substitute for *reliable* or *trustworthy*.

### Fact

Use this only of actual facts, matters capable of direct verification. Never use this for matters of judgment, however incontestable they may be.

The phrase "The fact is ..." can also be removed if you're not actually talking about a _verifiable fact_.

{{% example %}}
The fact is that writing is hard. => Writing is hard to me.
{{% /example %}}

### Factor

Overused. Can often be replaced by something more direct or definite.

{{% example %}}
Superior preparation was the biggest factor for his win. => He won by preparing better
{{% /example %}}

### Feature

Like factor, it usually adds nothing to a sentence.

{{% example %}}
The homepage featured several images of toys. => The homepage shows images of toys.
{{% /example %}}

To be avoided in the advertising sense of *offer as a special attraction*.

### He is a man who

A common type of redundant expression. Of course, it has variations. "She is a woman who", "They are a child who", "It is a country that", and more.

{{% example %}}
England is a country which I like => I like England.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
He is a man who likes to play games => He likes to play games
{{% /example %}}

### Honestly

Often used to add emphasis. But it should be avoided, for it implies that the rest of your statements weren't honest! 

It's like saying "I will _lie_ now" and then continuing like nothing happened. Scrap it.

### Just

Only use it for its original meaning (as a noun): *equitable, fair, even-handed* or *impartial*.

If used otherwise, it has no clear meaning and makes your sentences weaker.

{{% example %}}
It is just cool to see fireworks => It's cool to see fireworks.
{{% /example %}}

### Literally

Literally means something should be understood _exactly as it is said_. Figuratively means something should be understood _as a metaphor or figure of speech_ for something else.

In most cases, people use the wrong one. In almost all cases, using it is unnecessary anyway.

{{% example %}}
"He was literally dead with fatigue."
{{% /example %}}

Hmm. Is he dead now? No. Then it's not _literally._

{{% example %}}
"He was almost dead with fatigue." => "He was very tired" => "He was exhausted."
{{% /example %}}

### Maybe

Communicates uncertainty. It is, therefore, great for questions or suggestions. 

Any other time, it doesn't help in any way to add lots of insecurity to what you write. Remove it.

### Nature

Often redundant, just like *character*. Or more specific statements need to follow to explain it.

{{% example %}}
Acts of a hostile nature => Hostile acts
{{% /example %}}

### Never

See "always".

### Oftentimes

Archaic. Use *often*.

### Respectively

May usually be omitted. The reader assumes that the order in which you wrote the sentence, is the order you intended.

{{% example %}}
I swapped module A and B for module C and D, respectively.

We already assume that A swapped for C and B swapped for D. No need to add "respectively".
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
The books are listed under the names of their respective authors => The books are listed under the names of their authors
{{% /example %}}

In some kinds of formal writing (such as geometrical proofs) it is necessary for clarity. But it doesn't add much otherwise.

### Student body

A needless expression, just *students* is enough.

### Stuff

Casual and generic. A placeholder for when the writer doesn't know the actual word or phrase. If you don't bother finding out or explaining the details, don't reference something at all.

### System

Frequently used without necessity. Like "stuff", _anything_ can be a system, right?

{{% example %}}
They have adopted the commission system of government. => They have adopted government by commission.
{{% /example %}}

### That

Superfluous most of the time. Reread every sentence with *that* and see if you can leave it out.

{{% example %}}
He saw that the bird was eating => He saw the bird was eating.
{{% /example %}}

Don't use it with people. They are not objects! The proper word is *who*.

### Things

See "stuff".

## Misspelling & Misuse

### All right

Alright has become more popular, but two separate words is technically correct. Used in familiar speech in the sense of *"Agreed"*, *"Go ahead"* or "*Okay*". Avoid using it for anything else.

### Bid

Takes the infinitive without *to*. The past tense is *bade*.

{{% example %}}
I bade him to do it => I bade him do it
{{% /example %}}

### Due to

**Correctly** used when saying *because of* and then a particular noun.

{{% example %}}
Losses due to bad policy.
{{% /example %}}

**Incorrectly** used in adverbial phrases. (So, a seperate sentence giving a reason for the main sentence.)

{{% example %}}
She lost the game, due to carelessness.
{{% /example %}}

### Effect

As noun, means *result.* 

As verb, means to *bring about* or *accomplish.* 

**Not** the same as *affect*: that means *"to influence"*.

Too often used as a vague substitute when discussing art or creative endeavours. Vagueness is bad.

{{% example %}}
The painter used very delicate effects. => What does this mean!? Be more precise.
{{% /example %}}

### Etc. / etcetera

Equivalent to *and the rest* or *and so forth*. Should therefore not be used for people. Or if the reader could be left in doubt as to what "the rest" could be. 

Best used to shorten a list which has already been given in full. Or to replace unimportant words at the end of a quotation.

It is **incorrect** to end lists starting with *such as* or *for example* with "*etc.*". 

_Why?_ It's a bit weird to start a list of examples, and then just say: "hey, you should just imagine how the other examples go!"

### Irregardless

It's not a word. Regard*less* already means *without* regard.

### Less

I've stated this earlier in the course. I'll state it again because it's such a frequent error.

Don't replace it with *fewer*. *Less* only applies to uncountable nouns and comparing quantities.

{{% example %}}
* Five is less than ten.
* There were less holes in my garden than last year => There were _fewer_ holes in my garden than last year
* His troubles are less than mine => means his troubles are _smaller in size_
* His troubles are fewer than mine => means his troubles are _smaller in number_
{{% /example %}}

### Kind of

**Don't** use it as substitute for ...

* *Rather* (before adjectives and verbs)
* *Something like* (before nouns)

Restrict it to its actual meaning. Kind means _type_ or _embodiment_.

{{% example %}}
He plays guitar with a strange kind of passion.
{{% /example %}}

The same is true for *sort of*.

### One of the most

Avoid beginning paragraphs with this kind of phrase. It takes many words, yet it's cliché, vague and meaningless.

{{% example %}}
The guitar is one of the most universally played instruments. => The guitar is a popular instrument.
{{% /example %}}

It's not wrong. I just don't like those phrases with many words which can be removed.

### Phase

Means *stage of transition or development*. Does not mean *aspect* or *topic*.

### To possess

Don't use it as a substitute for the simpler verbs *have* or *own*. It needlessly complicates a sentence.

### To state

Don't use it as a substitute for the specific *say* or *remark*. Restrict it to the sense of: *express fully or clearly*.

### While

Don't use it as a substite for "*and"* or "*but"*. Instead, split the sentence in two, or use a semicolon.

Using it for "*although"* fine, if this doesn't lead to ambiguity or absurdity.

It's best to restrict it while to the sense of *during the time that*.

{{% example %}}
* I walked to the park, while Susan danced the tango
* I walked to the park; Susan danced the tango
* I walked to the park. Susan danced the tango.
{{% /example %}}

### Whom

A (slightly archaic) conjugation of *who* when it's the (in)direct object of a sentence.

{{% example %}}
To whom should I address this letter?
{{% /example %}}

Often incorrectly used for *who* before *he said* or similar expressions.


## Clarification

### As good or better

Rearrange the sentence so that "*or better*" (or "*if not better*") is at the end. It's easier to read and understand.

{{% example %}}
This is as good or better than that => This is as good as that, or better
{{% /example %}}

### Claim

With object, means *lay claim to*. Don't use as a substitute for *declare, maintain* or *charge*.

### Compare

The preposition makes the difference.

* To *compare to* is to point out or imply resemblances between objects regarded as different 
* To *compare with* is to point out differences between objects regarded as similar

### Consider

When followed by *"as"* means *"believe to be"*. 

{{% example %}}
The report is considered **as** an example of good scientific journarling.
{{% /example %}}

Otherwise means *"examined"* or *"discussed".*

{{% example %}}
He considered the writings on the wall.
{{% /example %}}

### Fix

Colloquial (in American English) for *arrange, prepare* or *mend*. It's used, more and more, on _everything_. And when you use one word for everything, communication loses meaning.

{{% example %}}
I fixed the internt issues => I (re)solved the internet issues.

Hey, let me fix that for you => Hey, let me help you with that.
{{% /example %}}

Restrict it to its original meaning: *to fasten, make firm*. 

Or, as a noun (fixed), it means *rigid* or *immovable*.

### However

Comes first in the sentence when it means "*in whatever way*" or "*to whatever extent*".

{{% example %}}
However hard you try, it won't happen.
{{% /example %}}

Place it after the subject or verb otherwise. (When it means *nevertheless*.)

{{% example %}}
I feel sorry for him. It is, however, not my problem.
{{% /example %}}

### Lose out

Used to sound more emphatic than *lose*.

{{% example %}}
Ah, you barely lost out on winning that prize!
{{% /example %}}

But it doesn't work. The same holds for *try out, win out, sign up* and *register up*.

A number of verbs form combinations with *out* and *up*, with different meanings

**Lose out** does not.

### Near by

Analogous with *close by* and *hard by*. But it's usually written as one word: *nearby*. 

*Near (at hand)*, however, is as good, if not better.

Not so nice as an adjective. I prefer _neighbouring_. 

{{% example %}}
We walked from our house to a nearby cottage. => We walked from our house to a neighbouring cottage.
{{% /example %}}

Use "adjacent" if something is _right next to_ something else.

### One hundred and one

Retain the *"and"* in this and similar expressions. Don't be tempted to write "one hundred one".

### People

*The people* is a political term. They create political support or opposition. 

*The public* is the right word otherwise. Artistic appreciation or commercial support comes from "the public".

Some people prefer using "persons" after a plural number, instead of "people". I'm on the fence about that.

### Viewpoint

Don't use it for *view* or *opinion*. 

I prefer *point of view*. But *viewpoint* has become more common and accepted. For example, when a book is told from the perspective of someone, they are called a "viewpoint character" now.

### Went

Don't use *went* for every action in your story. Consider more definite statements, such as walked, ran, drove, cycled.

{{% example %}}
He went to the bar. Then he went fishing. => He drove to the bar, and fished in the lake afterwards.
{{% /example %}}

### Worth while

A very new expression. I used to dislike it, but it's grown on me.

Can be used to show (dis)approval or how much you think something is worth. Can come before a noun or verb, although usage before a _noun_ is frowned upon.

{{% example %}}
Is it worthwhile to phone him?
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
It was a worthwhile visit to the zoo.
{{% /example %}}

### Would

A conditional statement in the first person requires *should*, not *would*.

{{% example %}}
I should have died if he hadn't saved me.
{{% /example %}}

This probably comes from the fact that it's _you_ saying something about _yourself_. So you should know this statement for certain, instead of the uncertain "would".

The same is true for indirect quotations.

{{% example %}}
He said that soon enough the earth should be hit by an asteroid.
{{% /example %}}

To express habitual or repeated action, the past tense (without *would*) is usually sufficient.

{{% example %}}
Once a year he would visit his grandmother. => Once a year he visited his grandmother.
{{% /example %}}
