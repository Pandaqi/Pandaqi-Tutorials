Many courses or textbooks on English group verbs by time: _past_, _present_ and _future_. I don't like that approach. Verbs are easier to learn when grouped by _type_. 

Why? The reason verb tenses are put in the same group (by name), is because they _are_ almost the same. Both functionally ( = what they do) and syntactically ( = how to write them).

Each of the next chapters will, therefore, explain one group of verb tenses with the same name. 

* Simple
* Continuous
* Perfect
* Conditional
* Gerund & Participle
* Infinitive
* (Passive Voice)

Within most groups exist three variants. One for for each timing: present, past and future. 

This first chapter is about the one you already know: _simple present_. It's part of the _simple tenses_. The chapters after it follow the same structure: introduce a tense, then give the three variants for it.

> **Simple** tense is for _starting_ actions. (Which could also mean a general truth or habit you'll likely start or have started.)

## Why "simple"?

It's called that way because it is the simplest of them all when it comes to **grammar**. 

When it comes to **meaning**, though, there are some caveats. Every tense in English has some specific differences that you should know and understand. It's easy to write a sentence that _sounds_ right, but is actually the wrong tense for what you're trying to do.

Simple tenses describe general or repeatable truths. Like appointments, repeated actions/habits, instructions, etcetera. 

The simple tense does **not** describe actions while they are happening. The "continuous" tense does that, as the name implies.

{{% example %}}
I work as a nurse (👩‍⚕️) => this is a general truth about your job; you're not necessarily _currently at work, being a nurse_

I am working, don't bother me! => this is a different tense; you are _currently doing that work action_

This tutorial is almost entirely written in the present simple. Because it contains many general truths and instructions on how to write English.

## About sentences and time

The time of a sentence is really important. That's why verbs have so many variations: to convey all different ways an action can happen over time.

At the same time, we only have two ways to indicate time: **verb** and **time nouns**. 

{{% example %}}
I am sad on Mondays (😥) => the part "on Mondays" indicates the time this sentence talks about
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
I will jump to the other side (🦘) => the verb **will** indicates this is future tense, so the time of the sentence is somewhere in the future
{{% /example %}}

When choosing the right tense for your sentence, you need to ask yourself: "in what _time_ is this sentence situated?"

For example, if a sentence starts with "Yesterday", now the _whole sentence_ happens at that point in time. The reader knows: "everything in this sentence is in the past, and takes place _yesterday_"

Try to view tenses this way. It's not about modifying only a _verb_. It's about the time of the _whole sentence_. The verbs and nouns should _match_ each other with their timing.

Keep this in mind. It will help solve many issues.

## Simple Present

You've already learned how to construct the simple present. Use the verb stem (infinitive without `to`) for everyone. For third person singular, add an **"-s"** (like making nouns plural).

{{% example %}}
* I **work** in Manchester. (🧑‍💼)
* The exam **starts** at 10 AM. (📘🕙)
* They **try** to build a synagogue. (🏗️🕍)
* When you **come** home, there will be food in the fridge. (🏠, 🧆)
{{% /example %}}

It's used for:

-   General truths: unchanging situations, emotions, or wishes
-   Giving instructions or directions
-   Repeatable truths: habits and repeated actions
-   Expressing fixed arrangements/appointments in the present or future.
-   Expressing a future time. (Only after specific words: *after, before, as soon as, until, when*.)

## Simple Past

For this, we need to change the verb stem to its "past" form.

* Add **"-ed"** to the end
* If the verb already ends in **"-e"**, only add a **"-d"**

{{% example %}}
* Her mother **died** last year. (To die => died)
* We **lived** in Canada in 1985. (To live => lived)
* They **talked** about it yesterday. (To talk => talked)
{{% /example %}}

It's used for:

-   Something that happened frequently in the past. (*She often walked home alone.*)
-   A definite point in time. (*They made the arrangements last week*)
-   An indefinite point in time. (*We decided against it long ago*)

The "point in time" is important. Even when indefinite, the sentence still happens at a fixed point in time. "We decided against it long ago", means the whole sentence is put into the time period of "long ago".

This is different than a sentence with _no_ time indication at all. ("We have decided against it": the decision has already been made in the past, but when? Never said. That's a different tense.)

Remember the chapter about modal verbs and contractions! If a modal verb is present, you should put _the modal verb_ into its past form, but the main verb stays normal. 

{{% example %}}
* Her mother **didn't die** last year.
* We **didn't live** in Canada in 1985 
{{% /example %}}

## Irregular verbs

Earlier, you learned how to write auxiliary verbs in the past. And they didn't follow the rule above. They were different all the time.

{{% example %}}
* I am happy => I was happy (❌ I amed happy)
* They do the work => They did the work (❌ They doed the work)
* We have a chance => We had a chance (❌ We haved a chance)
{{% /example %}}

This is called an "irregular verb". It doesn't follow the regular rules. Almost every language has them. 

Why? These are some of the earliest verbs. Used in almost every sentence, used for very common day-to-day tasks and expressions. Their tenses evolved _before_ regular grammar rules.

{{% remark %}}
You might compare it to the _irregular nouns_. Those that don't follow the normal rules when they become plural: mouse => mice, man => men, tooth => teeth.
{{% /remark %}}

This irregularity only happens for the past. Because that is the tense where the verb is actually _modified_ (by placing that **-ed** after it). Many other tenses use those auxiliary verbs, which means the main verb needs no changing.

You'll learn these by reading English a lot. Below are common ones:

{{% example %}}
* I speak English => I **spoke** English when I was at university
* We eat dinner => We **ate** dinner last night
* She holds flowers => She **held** flowers
* I fall down => I **fell** down
* They drink too much => They **drank** too much
{{% /example %}}

In general, they are shorter than regular past verbs. They usually only change one _vowel_ in the verb, or switch two letters around.

{{% remark %}}
Languages slowly lose these irregular verbs. I think that's a shame. If possible, use them. Because they are short and clear, and add variety to the language. It _is_ possible for regular verbs to become irregular over time, but quite rare.

## Simple Future

In the simple future, the verb stays in regular form for all people. Instead, place the auxiliary verb **will** before it.

{{% example %}}
* He will never agree.
* Will you marry me?
* It will rain tomorrow
* They'll give you a ticket.
* She won't be happy with that news.
{{% /example %}}

It's used to:

-   Predict a future event.
-   Express a spontaneous decision. (_I will become a programmer!_)
-   Express willingness. (Or unwillingness, when negated.)
-   Give orders, when addressing someone or a group directly (with
    **you**).
-   Give an invitation, with **you** in interrogative form ( = a question).
-   Make an offer, suggest something or ask for advice/instructions. (It's preferred to use **shall** then: _Shall I buy a rose for you?_)

The future usage is easy to understand. But why the other uses? Why is this used to "give orders"? It is, again, a bit of passive-agressive English language.

By saying "you *will* go home now and grab your jacket", you are saying:

* I am so certain you follow my commands
* That this will indeed happen in the near future

There's an undertone of "don't you dare make my future prediction wrong; so obey me"

You should view this tense in that light. Same for the spontaneous decision: you feel good and confident that this statement will become true in the future. That's when you use this tense. (_I will start eating better and lose weight!_)

## Questions

When asking questions, you'll use the simple tense _most_ of the time. 

_Why?_ Let's say someone is doing something right now. You can see that happening. It is right in front of you, in the present. Why would you need to ask a question about it? 

Questions are likely not about that, but about those general truths, concepts or habits. Hence, the simple tense is used.

{{% example %}}
Do you play soccer? => Doesn't ask if the other is playing soccer _right now_. Asks if they regularly practice the sport.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
Are you playing soccer? => _This_ asks if the other is playing soccer _right now_. It uses the continuous tense, so let's learn that now!
