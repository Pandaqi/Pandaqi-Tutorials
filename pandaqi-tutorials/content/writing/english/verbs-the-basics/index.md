You've spent ten chapters learning the basics of English _sentences_ and _nouns_. Hopefully you agree that was time well spent. You know exactly 

* How to write the subject (or object) of a sentence
* How to refer to other nouns ([Pronouns](../pronouns/))
* How to glue them together ([Prepositions](../prepositions/)).

Now let's learn the other part of the formula: _verbs_. The actual thing the subject is _doing_ in the sentence.

> **Verbs** describe the action of a sentence. They communicate what the subject does.

## How verbs are defined

Verbs consist of a "stem" or a "base". This part of the verb stays the same, while other parts change. The way a verb changes is called a _conjugation_.

Why would a verb change? 

* To match the _subject_. (If there are multiple nouns in the sentence ... to which one does the verb belong?)
* To communicate the _timing_ of the action. (Did it happen in the past? Is it a prediction for the future? Is it currently happening?)

If you look up a verb in the dictionary, you find this base form, with the word `to` before it. That's called the **infinitive**.

This version describes the action _in general_. You might know it from a famous Shakespeare quote ...

{{% example %}}
To be or not to be ... 🎭
{{% /example %}}

It talks about "being". The concept of existing. But there's no subject, nobody is _doing_ that existing. 

{{% example %}}
To think 🧠, to see 👀, to eat 😋, to hear 👂, ...
{{% /example %}}

This syntax is therefore _rarely_ used. (When are _you_ ever talking about the general idea of existing? Or walking? Or eating?)

But if you replace the `to` with a subject ... you're suddenly creating sentences!

{{% example %}}
To see => I see a cat. (👀 🐱)
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
To hear => You hear music. (👂 🎶)
{{% /example %}}

## Subject

The verb changes based on the subject. 

_Why?_ To show the connection. If you read a noun, and the verb doesn't match it, you know that noun is _not_ the subject of the sentence!

English, though, has _way_ simpler rules than other languages. The benefits are reduced, but it's easier to learn.

The verb stem stays identical for all pronouns. (Both 1<sup>st</sup> person, 2<sup>nd</sup> person, and 3<sup>rd</sup> person.) 

Except for 3<sup>rd</sup> person singular: he / she / it. Then the rules are identical to how you create _plural nouns_.

* The third person gets an **-s** behind the verb stem. 
* But if the verb already ended with an s-like sound, add **-es** instead
* And if the verb ends with an **-y** (with no vowel before it), replace it with **-ies**

{{% example %}}
I see a cat => He see**s** a cat.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
You carry books => She carr**ies** books.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
We see a cat. They carry books. It feel**s** strange.
{{% /example %}}

## Time

Actions are closely linked to time. An action might already have been completed. Or it's currently going on. Or you might say you are _going to_ do something in the _future_.

All these different formats are called **verb tenses**.

All examples so far have used the easiest and most used tense: **simple present**. 

Its syntax is indeed _simple_. And it happens in the *present*, so not in the past or future. But its _meaning_ is often misunderstood. You will understand this once we get to that chapter.

The other tenses are _equally simple_. They only need slight changes to the verb stem. English has a very regular grammar ... so it must *compensate* somehow.

It uses **auxiliary verbs** to do that. Those are "helper verbs" added to other verbs to change their meaning. These are very important---and also very irregular and tough to memorize.

So let's take a break here. Next chapter will tell you all about them!
