All sentences, examples, and tutorials so far have been **active voice**. I recommend using that whenever you can. Because it's shorter, simpler and more direct.

But there's a whole different voice you can use: the **passive voice**.

When?

* To place emphasis on the _object_, not the _subject_
* When a subject is completely _missing_ from the sentence
* To be deliberately vague or build tension (used in novels)

{{% example %}}
* Active: Alan Parsons wrote "Old & Wise"
* Passive: "Old & Wise" was written by Alan Parsons
{{% /example %}}

In the active case, Alan Parsons is the subject. We focus on him. The title of what he wrote is less important.

In the passive case, we focus on the title of his song, and less so on Alan. The song isn't _doing_ anything. It's still the target of someone else writing it. But communicated this way, the emphasis is different.

And you can easily test this! In the passive version, you can leave out the subject entirely: "Old & Wise was written in 1982". 

This part trips up many people. Because only a _slight_ change is needed to completely flip each tense to their _passive voice_.

## How to write passive

To construct the passive voice, use **to be** + **past participle**. As expected, our modal verb ("to be") is responsible for changing the voice to all different tenses. We call this _conjugating_ the verb. The past participle just stays the same, always.

| \-                     | \-           | to be (conjugated)   | past participle |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------------- | --------------- |
| *Simple present*       | The car...   | is                   | cleaned |
| *Present continuous*   |              | is being             | cleaned |
| *Simple Past*          |              | was                  | cleaned |
| *Past Continuous*      |              | was being            | cleaned |
| *Simple future*        |              | will be              | cleaned |
| *Future continuous*    |              | will be being        | cleaned |
| *Present perfect*      |              | has been             | cleaned |
| *Past perfect*         |              | had been             | cleaned |

Notice that we don't know who is cleaning the car. Or what. We only know that the car is *being cleaned*.

A common use of passive voice is with the fact that *being born* is something passive. Your mother _bore_ you. But you, as a baby, were _being born_ by her.

> I was born in 1997. When were you born?

## Infinitive passive voice

This is used after modal verbs or other verbs requiring an *infinitive*. (Remember the previous chapter on [Infinitives](../verbs-infinitives/)?)

Construct it with: **modal verb** + **(to) be** + **past participle**.

{{% example %}}
* You need **to test** your skills => You **have to be tested** on your skills. 
* They want **to invite** him => He **wants to be invited** to the party. 
* You may **disappoint** her (zero infinitive) => She **may be disappointed** in you.

## Gerund passive voice

This is used after verbs that require *gerunds* behind it. (Remember the chapter on [Gerunds](../gerunds/)?)

Construct it with: **being** + **past participle**

{{% example %}}
I hate interviewing => I hate **being interviewed**
My dogs like cuddling => My dogs like **being cuddled**
{{% /example %}}

## About the passive voice

I hope you notice how much _longer_ sentences get in passive voice. More _complicated_, with lots of verbs. That's why it's not recommended.

And still, it exists in basically every language. Because humans like talking this way. As we form thoughts, we first start with what's most important, and then create the rest of the sentence around it.

This accidentally leads to passive sentences.

If you want to improve communication, especially writing, focus on writing _active_. Check every sentence for passiveness, and rewrite to active voice.

Passive: He was tested by the doctors. They were questioned by him on all the dangers, but didn't want to give any response. The procedure would be done by their best doctor available, or so he was told.

The doctors tested him. He questioned them on all the dangers, but they didn't want to respond. They only said their "best doctor" would do the procedure.

The second is shorter, cleaner, more clear. You don't lose any information, but gain space and attention. But you probably read the passive version and didn't think there was anything wrong with it.
