The _gerund_ is nothing more than the **continous form** we've been using all this time. (Walking, talking, eating, etcetera.)

So what's the difference? A gerund means this form is used as a **noun**.

Every action can both be _done_ (as a verb) or be _described_ (as the general concept of doing that thing).

Use the gerund when describing an _activity_ or _event_ (which consists of a certain action), instead of somebody doing the action itself.

**Hunting** can be bad for the environment. (‚öîÔ∏èüêª can be ‚ùåüå≥)

We don't say _who hunts_. Nobody is doing a hunt in this sentence. It's about the general activity of someone hunting animals.

When used this way, it is the subject of the sentence. When applied any other way, it needs some help ...

-   A preposition. (*We arrived **after** **driving** for two hours*)
-   Or a verb. (*He tried to **give up smoking**.*)

{{% remark %}}
There are also some unique expressions that need a gerund after it. These are: *can't help, can't stand, to be worth* and *it's no use*. For example, "It's no use trying to escape."

A last common use is as a complement of the verb **to be**:

{{% example %}}
His life goal is to find all Pok√©mon => His life goal **is finding** all Pok√©mon

As you can see, the gerund and the infinitive are closely linked. Whenever you can use the infinitive (`to` + verb), you can replace it with a gerund. Why? Both describe the general concept of an action, more like a noun.

You'll learn a bit more detail about infinitives soon.
