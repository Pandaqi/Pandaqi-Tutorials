The present participle is another word that simply uses the **continuous form** you already know. (Walking, talking, eating, speaking, ...)

Unlike the gerund, it actually functions as a verb. It is used after another verb to communicate _two actions_ at the same time.

More specifically, these are the uses.

## Movement or position

Placed after verbs of movement and position.

{{% example %}}
* She lay looking at the stars. => We know she is _lying down_ and _looking_ at the same time
* We sat staring out of the window. => We are _sitting_ and _starting_ at the same time
{{% /example %}}

Do note that this construction is often _needlessly long_. People often add another verb which is already _implied_ through the present participle. Try to recognize this and just use the short version.

{{% example %}}
* They went hiking. => They hiked. (You usually don't hike right where you are, so you go hiking.)
* I came running towards him. => I ran towards him. (If you run, you already come to someone.)
{{% /example %}}

## Perception

Placed after verbs of perception or sense. (Like *to hear, to see, to smell, to watch, to feel*.)

{{% example %}}
I felt the wind blowing in my face.
{{% /example %}} 

{{% example %}}
I heard someone singing down the street.
{{% /example %}}

## Describing two distinct actions

You want to convey _two_ actions, not closely related, in the same sentence. 

The present participle is placed in its own clause. (A small sentence seperated from the main one, through a comma.)

{{% example %}}
**Singing to herself**, she cycled to school.
{{% /example %}}

{{% example %}}
"Hands behind your head," he said, **pulling his gun**.
{{% /example %}}

## Special verbs

Some verbs typically get the present participle after them: **spend**, **waste**, **catch** and **find**

{{% example %}}
* The doctor spends five hours a day **sleeping**. 
* I wasted a hundred dollars **trying** to get there.
* I caught him **stealing** my wallet. 
* They found two old coins **lying** in the sand.
