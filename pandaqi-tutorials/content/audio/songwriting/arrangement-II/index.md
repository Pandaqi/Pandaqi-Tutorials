In this last chapter, I'll give specific practical tips for designing another melody against an existing melody. This concept is usually called **counterpoint**: the relationship between two melodies played at the same time.

That's a vague and broad description. So let's see some specific implementations of it.

## Same distance

This technique is the simplest. It's very common for doubling (or quadrupling) pop vocals.

> Sing the same melody, but offset by a distance (usually a third, fifth or octave)

So grab your melody. Now let it start on some other note, but keep the distances the same. In other words, the _whole melody_ was shifted up or down.

When I say distance, I mean the _interval of the scale_, not the absolute distance. So if the first two notes are a third apart in your melody, they should also be a third apart in your copy.

Play them at the same time and enjoy.

## Different directions

Very early in this course, I said pitch didn't have many places to go. It could go up, go down or stay the same.

You can exploit that fact here.

> If one melody goes up, the other goes down or stays the same. (And vice versa.)

The _combined_ effect is great. It also helps create variation in that second melody, preventing it from being a copy.

## Overflow notes

This is my personal name for the concept: **overflow notes** It's not an official one :p

I _also_ mentioned, early in this course, that you could combine many pitches as long as there is _distance_ between them.

This means that you can add notes _above_ your main melody pretty much anywhere on the scale. (And maybe even outside of the scale.) These are officially named by continuing to count beyond the octave: 9th, 11th, 13th, etcetera.

When you have a melody _above_ the leading one, I'd usually recommend this.

* Either play the same melody, but up by an entire octave
* Or play a melody that mostly uses these overflow notes.

It will create surprising harmonies and sounds against the main melody. Not all of it will be great: experiment and improve.

:R/2 D4/4 D4/4 | E4/8 E4/4. C4/4 B3/8 B3/8 | R/2 D4/4 D4/4 | C4/8 A3/4 E4/4. C4/8 C4/8 | C4/8

## The hardest counterpoint

These are all simple techniques: follow some simple rules to create a second melody that plays with the first. 

They will be all you need in most cases. But if you _are_ ready for more, you can create different (and more complicated) patterns.

You would start from _completely different melodies_.

Then, you try to manipulate them in such a way that ...

* Sometimes they combine. (They play the same note, they strengthen each other.)
* Sometimes they vary, and one of them takes the spotlight for a time.

They're like yin and yang: sometimes they come together, sometimes they are apart.

This is _hard_. You'll most likely end up making the melodies similar---or just applying the simple ideas above in alternating fashion---to make it all work.

But when it does work, it's very rewarding. You can get beautiful harmonies and pieces, with a richness and flavor you won't find anywhere else.
