Lyrics mostly follow the same principles as [Rhythm](../rhythm-I/) and [Pitch](../melody-I/). I mean, I've explained the importance of _rhyming_ ten times---and that's a concept most people will only know from language!

That's why I'll first explain what's new and different. This chapter assumes you already have your melody, and add lyrics afterward.

Next chapter I'll talk about when the lyrics come first, and the melody second. Then I'll also give some quick examples about how the previous principles apply.

## What's our goal?

What's the point of lyrics? To ...

* Convey a melody (in a nice way)
* Convey a message or emotion

You can choose, for yourself, which is more important. But to me, I'd always pick something that _sounds good_ over the other.

That wasn't always the case. I have many songs, from when I was a kid, where I really tried to _cram_ all my beautiful sentences onto melodies where they just didn't fit. I was more concerned with proper grammar and telling a novel, than anything else.

And that's the issue. You're _not_ telling a novel. You're creating music. If you care 100% about your message or topic, you'd _write a novel_ or _give a speech_. Those are ideal for that purpose.

Music is about emotion and entertainment, first and foremost. If your "message" gets in the way of that, nobody _wants_ to listen to the song, so it isn't _heard_ anyway.

It also means you shouldn't preach. Another beginner mistake: writing a song like you're _explaining_ or _convincing_ the listener. You're not. Songs are about the singer _conveying_ some feeling or thought in a musical way. Give preference to the emotion and to _your viewpoint_. The listener will decide or interpret however they want.

## Lyrics that fit

Lyrics that _sound good_ are more important. So let's start there.

> You're more than allowed to play with grammar or distort words if that _sounds better_.

Listen to popular singers. They most likely pronounce certain sounds in an odd way. For _their_ songs (or voice), it sounds wonderful and better.

Similarly, sounds are often stretched or repeated. 

* "Day" might become two syllables: "Da-y"
* "Heart" might become "Ha-Ha-Heart"
* Any vowel can be stretched over multiple pitches: "Hee-ee-eey"

And we all know some popular songs that commit grammar crimes left and right.

My tip is to give preference to this, if possible. Find words and sounds that _fit with your melody_. Once that fit perfectly and complement it. 

Start there. Start by listing words or sentences that would fit your melody. Once you have a few amazing pieces, use the rest of the lyrics to make it _mean_ something.

> You are not allowed to break rhythm at will to sneak an extra syllable in there (or remove one)

And you know why! Because any sudden change to that rhythm of the notes will feel odd and ugly to us. Listeners will _know_ you only did that so that the words actually fit the melody.

Don't change a rhythm that works. Change the words---or in what way you sing them---to fit the music.

### Side note: not for everyone

Different genres have different "sounds" that are common. Or, conversely, sounds that just kill the mood.

Singing "Night" like you're saying "I", spread over three notes, is fine in a pop song.

In musical theatre, that won't do. There, diction is important. Text needs to fit the melody perfectly and be understood by all.

Conversely, a heavy vibrato is fine there, while a punk singer with vibrato wouldn't be great.

Research the common sounds for your genre. Apply those.

### Practical tips

Some words just sound good and other's don't. You'll only learn this through experience. (It'd be quite useless to provide a long list here of all the words I can think of.) You probably already thought of a few clichés, like "heart", "you" and "hurt".

These are mostly emotional words. Yes, the sound is determined by the _actual sound_ (and how much emotion you can put into it), but also the _meaning_. I mean, "you" isn't far from "poop". But I can't for the life of me imagine someone singing poop and actually sounding good while doing it.

In general, 

* It's easier to manipulate short, well-known words. 
* Alternatively, a lyric sounds more sophisticated and strong if you use _longer words_.

Turning "Day" into "Da-y" won't create issues. People will _still_ understand it and it's easy to make the change. Manipulating the sound or rhythm of "condescendingly" is a tougher task.

But if you _can_ fit such long words on the melody, it's magic. It's hard. It's rare. That's why people notice it and it "feels" right. The important part, of course, is that the syllables match, especially the _emphasized_ syllable.

This might actually be a great challenge. Find some long words. Try to put them to a melody, and they need to fit perfectly.

## Lyrics that mean something

For me, this is usually the second step. And often it's not much of a step at all. By now, you basically have your whole song; you only need to "connect the dots".

This means you probably already _have_ a theme or topic. There's already an emotion to the words. In the meantime, your brain already worked out what it wanted to say.

Look at what you have and try to make it as strong as possible. Remember, we're not preaching or explaining. You are writing from a _personal emotion_ or _experience_.

This is one of the fun quirks of humans. Nobody wants to listen to a song in which you _tell_ them to, I don't know, "don't break promises". But they'll listen to a song in which you tell a story about how _you_ broke a promise and ended up feeling worse for it---which clearly has the same message.

### Exploration

Art is mostly an **exploration** of a topic or feeling. That's what lyrics should be. It's similar to an essay, but with the key difference that logic or arguments aren't our focal point here.

Remember, we're still not making a _Powerpoint presentation_.

Instead,

* The first few lines throw something interesting out there. Something worth exploring.
* The rest of the song talks about it in different ways. Maybe different emotions, different perspectives, different consequences, or just the same thing in different words.

The verse offers something. A thought, a problem, a situation. Start with a few sentences that are intriguing, or mysterious, or clearly set a tone.

Then the chorus moves to the most emotional moment. A decision, a terrible consequence, or a really _happy_ feeling. It's like giving a summary of the most emotional highlight from this topic. 

This isn't a "conclusion" or "answer to a problem". Because,

* That'd be preaching or teaching again
* Where do you go from there? Your first chorus concludes your story ... what then? (If you conclude, make that the last sentence of your song.)
* The best topics for songs _have_ no conclusion or answer

{{% example %}}
I think about the song "Case of You" by Joni Mitchell. Beautiful song, beautiful vocals. But look at the lyrics:

* The choruses are about the highlight. This feeling of being so in love, expressed in one strong thought. She could "drink a case of you, and I'd still be on my feet" This is a summary of the topic. This is what you remember, the one-liner that expresses the feeling best.
* The verses all provide different scenarios around this. Things the other person told her. A warning from another about the person. Her own faults or mistakes and how they interact with this love. Different ways to explain the same feeling.

It's an exploration of the feeling of such love, in beautiful musical form.

Yes, exploration is the key word. Don't start making mind-maps, or doing word association tricks, or getting a (rhyming) dictionary. You have a strong melody and some strong sounds you want to use.

Find a common ground, a good topic, a feeling inside you. And _explore_ that. Doing the exploration during verses or quieter parts, and providing the highlight or the strongest emotion in the chorus and bridge.

{{% remark %}}
And exploration means making mistakes. Means trying stuff. Maybe you write a few sentences, then wake up the next day and realize just how bad they are. Now you can try something _better_. No good song will come from somebody who assumes they have all the answers or dares not take any emotional risk.

### Writing skill

But no matter how many tips I give, lyric writing is obviously a **writing** skill. You need a good understanding of language to do it. It's hard to communicate anything if you don't know the words or the linguistic structure.

Even then, some vocabulary or grammar rules aren't enough. Knowing the theory does _not_ imply you can apply the theory (well). It takes more skill than that to put multiple sentences to the same rhythm. To find rhyme words that sound good, but aren't cliché or contrived. 

Usually, there are sharper ways to say what you want to say. A beginner might write a sentence of thirty words to convey a feeling. An experienced writer can do the same in ten _stronger_ words.

A experienced writer will also know many small "rules" to make a lyric better, such as

* Emphasis is automatically added to words at the start or end.
* Repetition is great when intended (and a few words apart), not if you accidentally use the same words over and over. (Something like "Love is great, love is amazing, love is lovely oh I love love." is repetition ... but hardly an easy lyric to make work.)
* Active and direct voice is usually better. (Humans tend to "hedge", adding all these filler words, or writing sentences in passive voice. It just adds noise and muddles the message.)

This is, again, not in the realm of this course. You can check out some of my [Writing](../../../writing/) courses. 

Or just read, write and speak a lot. Consume many different types of media in the language of choice. And simply _try_ songwriting a lot, giving yourself feedback as you go.

I wrote a whole course about [How to learn anything](../../../life-skills/how-to-learn-anything/). It outlines simple habits, supported by science and practice, to actually pick up new skills really fast. And in a way that's fun, instead of feeling like homework.
