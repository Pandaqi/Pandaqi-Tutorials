This article explains a principle that is crucial to _any_ creative field, and songwriting is no exception. In fact, it's even more important and it's even easier to see it in action. It's the principle of **Repetition & Surprise**.

> A piece of art is usually deemed "good" if it has a nice mix of repetitive elements and surprising elements

You might also call it **Familiar & New** or **Structure & Variation**. This principle applies to a whole song as well as the details within.

What does it mean?

## Repetition

Well, listen to any popular song, and you'll probably notice they all follow some general _structure_.

* Verse, chorus, verse, chorus, ...
* Usually, each verse has the same melody. A chorus often has the same melody _and_ lyrics.
* Within each section, melody lines or phrases might be repeated. They might follow a certain rhyming or rhythmic scheme.

When you look at this, you'll notice songs are at least 50% _repetition_ and a _common structure_. But that's not 100% of the story---that'd mean all songs are just the same sentence over and over! It provides a good _foundation_ on which to build a creative and unique song.

## Surprise

The other 50% comes from _surprise_ and _new elements_. **Rhyming** is this principle on steroids. You _repeat_ the sound of a word, but _vary_ it slightly so that the two words rhyme. Our brains love that!

* Even though similar, no verse is usually the same. Through new lyrics and perhaps a changed melody here or there, you add variety to the structure.
* Again, even though very similar, no chorus is usually _identical_. Later choruses often change a few lines or raise the pitch. Again, 99% structure, just that sprinkle of surprise.
* The instrumentation for the whole song is mostly the same, but once in a while an instrument is dropped or added.

Sometimes people call this the "hook": the surprising melody change that _captures_ listeners. Without a hook, there's nothing unique or exciting to capture somebody.

Conversely, without _structure_ the song is incoherent and chaotic. The listener will have a hard time "getting into it" or knowing what they're even listening to. That's why pop songs focus more on _structure_ (so they're easy to digest), but therefore all sound similar.

What's the lesson?

* You can _start_ a song by using a well-known, common structure. But make sure to add enough variety to make it better.
* Alternatively, if your song feels incoherent or like a mess, purposely add _structure_ to it.

Sometimes, I have several loosely related musical ideas that appear over time. If I just place them one after another, it'd sound horrible. Sudden changes in tempo, rhythm, key, lyrical theme, etcetera. So what do you do? You decide a few "rules" for the song and force each idea to follow them. You might decide "the key is X" and "the lyrics are about Y". You might keep one idea _only_ for the bridge or the outro, so the rest of the song can be more repetitive.

The more songs you write, the more you'll understand the exact balance between these two topics.

This principle will be the common thread in the following chapters. With songwriting, it can be applied in four major ways:

* Rhythm
* Pitch
* Lyrics
* Arrangement ( or Instrumentation)

That's why I'll only give a general example here, then continue. See it as a taste of what's to come.

## Example: crafting a melody

### Start with structure

We start with a "melody" that is nothing but one repetitive structure. Always the same note, always the same length. Pretty boring, right?

{{< midi tempo="120" >}}
F3/2 F3/2 F3/2 F3/2
{{< /midi >}}

Now we want to _break_ the structure, but only a little bit. We want to change things, but still in a way that is predictable. Still following a pattern of sorts. (Otherwise, starting with structure doesn't matter. You end up with chaos anyway after one step!) 

For example, here's a "rule": every second note is split in two. In a way, we've now divided our melodic idea into two parts.

{{< midi tempo="120" >}}
F3/2 F3/1 F3/1 F3/2 F3/1 F3/1
{{< /midi >}}

Now let's add a rule about pitch: each part only goes _up_.

{{< midi tempo="120" >}}
F3/2 G3/1 A3/1 F3/2 G3/1 A3/1
{{< /midi >}}

Hmm, those two long notes still feel too repetitive. Too monotonous. Let's break the second one into some random parts.

{{< midi tempo="480" >}}
F3/8 G3/4 A3/4 F3/3 F3/2 F3/1 F3/2 G3/4 A3/4
{{< /midi >}}

Ah, we're getting somewhere. Notice how the melody is still very structured. It follows some obvious patterns, but it already sounds much better. So let's finish it by providing one "odd note out". I just picked one note at random and put it somewhere else.

{{< midi tempo="480" >}}
F3/8 G3/4 A3/4 F3/3 F3/2 F3/1 F3/2 C4/4 A3/4
{{< /midi >}}

### Start with surprise

This time, we do the opposite. I literally placed random notes with random lengths. (Behind the scenes, I input these examples by just writing an octave, a note, and a number for the length.)

{{< midi tempo="480" >}}
G3/2 C4/7 F3/1 A3/1 D4/5 B2/10 A#3/4 B3/2 
{{< /midi >}}

This is completely random. Yet ... this already gives us something. The first few notes actually sound fine. The last half is just weird and doesn't fit with it.

So let's add structure. Take the first part and duplicate it.

{{< midi tempo="480" >}}
G3/2 C4/7 F3/1 A3/1 D4/5 G3/2 C4/7 F3/1 A3/1 D4/5 
{{< /midi >}}

It's not much better. But at least it's less chaotic. Now it feels too repetitive: after the first part, it feels like the melody "resets" just to do the same thing again.

So let's move the second part up (in pitch). Also, change the transition in hopes of making it smoother.

{{< midi tempo="480" >}}
G3/2 C4/7 F3/1 A3/1 D4/6 B3/1 D4/7 A3/1 B3/1 E4/5 
{{< /midi >}}

Ah, we're getting somewhere! If you _look_ at this melody (visually), you can see that we go up two times ... but in a different way. This time, I think that does _not_ sound good. So let's make those quick notes upward follow the same pattern.

{{< midi tempo="480" >}}
G3/2 C4/7 G3/1 A3/1 D4/6 B3/1 D4/7 B3/1 C4/1 E4/5 
{{< /midi >}}

Finally, the melody still feels a bit too chaotic. If you _look_ at this melody again, you'll see that we only have _very quick notes_ and _long ones_. This suggests we can add our last bit of structure by changing some notes to be of _medium_ length.

{{< midi tempo="480" >}}
G3/4 C4/4 G3/1 A3/1 D4/6 B3/1 D4/7 B3/1 C4/1 E4/8
{{< /midi >}}

There you have it. Something that might provide an uplifting, heroic score to a film.

Obviously, these are extremely _simple_ and _quick_ examples. But they show how these principles turn any starting point into an acceptable melody.
