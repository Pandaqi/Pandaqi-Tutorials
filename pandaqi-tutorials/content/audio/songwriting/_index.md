This guide is about _writing_ music. It's a general guide. You can write pop songs with it, but also perhaps film scores or songs for musical theatre.

I'm a professional musician under the name [Tiamo el Troubadour](https://eltroubadour.com). 

Frankly, music _mixing_ is my weak spot. You'll hear that, if you have any critical ear for music.

But songwriting? I am confident I can give you many, many golden nuggets of wisdom :)

@TODO? Feels like it's too vague or abstract now, at some points.
- Use my metronome on more pieces than just one xD
- More about writing for a specific direction. (A scene, film score, leitmotif, etcetera.)
- Do I use my own songs as examples or not?
