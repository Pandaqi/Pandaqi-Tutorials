There you have it! All my tips and practical philosophy on composing and songwriting. You have learned ...

* To record any and all inspiration. To prime your brain and get unstuck on command.
* To design great melodies, taking advantage of simple principles about rhythm and pitch.
* To rhyme and create patterns everywhere! Structure and surprise!
* To fit lyrics onto those songs; or to fit songs onto lyrics you already have
* And to combine multiple ideas into a full composition with multiple instruments or voices

There's always more to learn. But the truth is: learning is done by _you_. Go write some songs. Write a hundred. Get that experience, experiment with these ideas, and you will learn all the thousands of details on your own. Much more effectively than if I just told you.

Now go and make awesome music!
