Singing is a skill everybody wants to have. Good singers can make music anytime, anywhere they want. They can write _and produce_ their own songs. 

Your speaking voice, similarly, makes all the difference. A clear voice helps you with everyday tasks and makes you more (socially) likable.

This short guide gives practical exercises and tips for improving both of these.

Many think you are just born with a bad or good voice---but that is just not true. You are born with a certain vocal sound, range and technique. All of these can be changed or improved through proper training. (Except if you have a health issue that physically prevents this. When in doubt, always visit an expert to look at your throat and vocal folds.)
