This final chapter of the guide talks about vocal damage. About how to take care of your fragile voice, through lifestyle, food, and other health-related habits.

As mentioned at the start, your voice is a complex system, part of a _larger_ complex system (your body). It's hard to have good breath support if you have terrible stamina, or your posture makes breathing harder. It's hard to relax your swallow muscles if you sing after you've _just eaten_. It's hard to sing in general if some food, or lack of hydration, irritates your throat.

Below are the most common and useful tips I've discovered the past decade.

## Water

Most people know this: drink a lot of water. The more you sing or speak, the more you drink. Just keep a bottle or glass nearby, always.

Don't _wait_ until you are thirsty or feel a dry mouth. That's too late.

Also, abstain from any other drink. Sugar water, coffee, alcohol, basically _every_ drink has a lot of components that are bad for your health and your throat.

An exception might be made for tea. It's hot water and it usually has good herbs. Many musical theatre actors actually prefer this for treating their voice.

## Food

Many report issues after eating _dairy products_ or _chocolate_. I know, this isn't great, as many people love one of these (or both). Especially in the Netherlands---where I live---we're all about milk and cheese :p

But I can confirm this: eating such a product basically makes singing impossible for me the next 30 minutes.

_Spicy_ or _hot_ food is actually recommended! It cleans your throat and your nose.

Besides that, it's individual. People react differently to different foods. I know most singers have a list of "weirdly specific foods that don't gel with my voice".

Perhaps the most important part is eating food that _doesn't upset your stomach_. Because breath support comes from your abdomen. If it's hurting, if it's filled with gas, singing well becomes near impossible.

## Other substances

This one is also not surprising. Alcohol, smoking, drugs, all of these are terrible for your general health and your voice.

A rough voice may sound sexy, but only for the 5 to 10 years that it may last.

## Vocal abuse

This one is often overlooked. Some people have jobs or environments that cause them to _yell_ or _scream_ a lot. Reduce this as much as possible, or take enough vocal breaks to let your voice heal.

Additionally, many people _cough_ or _grunt_, usually because they think that "clears" their voice. It doesn't really. You just slam your vocal folds together---aggressively---which hurts them. This is a subconscious habit that is hard to break, but it's important to do so.

Even if your voice hurts, even if you feel "stuff" in the way of your singing, don't start coughing or scraping your throat. Drink water, do some exercises to remove the blockade, go back to singing when it feels safe.

This "stuff" between your vocal folds is usually _phlegm_ or _mucus_. This creates a raspy voice, one that is uncontrollable and might completely "disconnect" at some points.

## General issues

Most issues, as mentioned, come from tension. You use some muscles too much, making them tired or hurt. Other muscles aren't used at all, creating a weak voice that must compensate. You might use too much air, asking too much from your folds trying to work with it.

As such, most vocal issues are not _permanent_, but should be trained away _gradually_ with the vocal exercises I mentioned.

When an issue does seem permanent, or more significant than what I described, please visit an expert. There are diseases or physical injuries that _can't_ be solved with simple exercises. They need intervention, or medicine, or a whole change in lifestyle. 

When unsure, visit an expert anyway. We, humans, are very good at _adapting_. This means that a throat ache that started out terribly painfully ... becomes just a dull pain after a few weeks. You've forgotten how terrible it is and might underestimate the severity.

When in pain, give yourself a few days of (full) vocal rest. If that doesn't help, immediately seek help. The longer you wait, the harder it is to come back.

As expected, I know this from personal experience. Both with my voice and with other parts of your body.

We're so good at adapting and compensating, that we train ourselves to perform the craziest habits all day. That's how I walked on _one leg_ for years, before noticing that. It took years of training to get back into the habit of standing on both legs, using them both equally.

Similarly, I had that "coughing" habit I described above. I'd constantly cough when I heard my raspy voice---worsening the issue. I did it without second thought, maybe hundreds of times a day. Once I realized this, it took a few _months_ of conscious effort to stop doing this.
