As stated, this course is only about _mixing_. So you should already have your audio, which means I won't talk about microphones, cables, or anything of the sort. Skip this chapter if you already have all your tools!

Purely for mixing, you only _need_ one tool: **software** on some device. These are called DAWs: Digital Audio Workstations.

## Useful tools

But some extra steps are generally recommended. If you have the budget. And more experience than a true novice.

### Acoustic treatment

Acoustic treatment is more a _must_ than a recommendation. But this should've been taken care of before you started recording. It's _way more important_ when recording, than when listening. (Recordings with bad acoustics can't really be "saved" during the mixing stage.)

I've written an in-depth article about it for my recording course: [Acoustics](../../recording/space-i-acoustics/). Simply replace the "microphone" with "you".

Good acoustic treatment means you can better _hear_ what you're doing. Reverb and noise from your room---or the outside world---stop interfering with what you hear. So you can make better mixing decisions.

### MIDI Controller

I'd recommend some type of **(MIDI) controller**. This could be a MIDI keyboard, maybe with some knobs and dials. Or just a device that's _completely_ knobs, dials and sliders.

Why? These are your "physical" workstation. Instead of clicking with your mouse on tiny fake knobs, you _actually_ move physical things in the real world! This is faster, more fun, and allows you to change multiple things at once. Playing with such a controller, you'll find good settings or good sounds more easily.

Additionally, despite everyone's best effort, a collection of recordings usually isn't enough. You often want to record some quick extra parts or effects for the background.

Maybe the piano sounds a bit thin, but you have no time/money to record more. Grab that MIDI keyboard and play the part on it, using some piano samples. Play it at the same time as the original recording, and it sounds fuller.

## Choose your DAW

There are many options to choose from. I've tried many, not all. 

I suggest you take _some_ time trying as many as you can. See what works for you, see what you like the most. But once you've found a favorite? Pick it and _stick to it_. Otherwise you waste time learning a new DAW regularly, learning new interfaces or buttons---which means you can't spend that time on actually being productive.

Because yes, other software will always look shinier than the one you use right now. We always want what we don't have.

My ranking of software is based entirely on the user interface: does it _look good_ and is it _fast and intuitive_?

You'll be working with it day in, day out. I want something pretty to look at. Any minute gained in productivity, any potential stumbling block prevented, will lead to huge productivity gains in the long run.

As such, if you care more about included plugins / sounds, or how "powerful" it is, or the "industry standard"---ignore my ranking entirely.

### Studio One

I've used this for years. It has a great workflow and user interface that doesn't make me gouge out my eyes. In all those years, I've only encountered a handful of "bugs" or "annoying issues". That's not much, for any software.

It's relatively cheap. It even has a free version: Studio One Prime.

It's a "jack of all trades". It will have everything you need, without excelling at any specific area of audio engineering.

### Logic Pro / GarageBand

As usual, Apple cares a lot about how software _looks_ and feels. They also care a lot about keeping you in their ecosystem, which is why their software is only available on Mac computers.

I used these extensively when I still had an iMac (as a kid). They are, again, a jack of all trades. Usable by anyone, can do what you want, but no clear genre or area for which it's meant.

### Ableton Live

This is perfect for beats and electronic music. Dance, dubstep, live mixing. For "non-standard sounds", such as sound effects for games or instrumental tracks. (Apparently, "standard sound" means a song or a band to me. Something you could play on the radio.)

An established brand, includes everything you need, and the interface isn't half bad. 

{{% remark %}}
It's not the type of music I create (often), so after a short demo period I never used it again. But I know it's very popular. And every time I see it, or a tutorial that uses it, I'm impressed by what it can do and how clean it looks.

### Audacity

This is free! (And open source!) It used to be much lower on the list. Because it could only do some basic audio editing (very well), but would never work as a DAW for full songs or projects. All the effects were _destructive_: you had to apply them, changing that track permanently.

But recent updates have solved most of my issues with it. The interface is getting more attractive and user friendly. It now supports non-destructive editing, better track management, and more. Another big update is coming, following the same path.

I suspect that it will soon be, by far, the best free and open source DAW available.

### Reason

This is perfect for people who are more accustomed to the _physical_ equipment used when recording and mixing. It simulates many physical tools and amplifiers in their "rack".

To me, this makes it both very powerful and very limited in what it can do. You will get _great_ sounds on instruments or effects. But it's the opposite of a "jack of all trades": it's not an well-rounded DAW that you can use for everything.

Last I checked, it can't record audio. It only works with MIDI and existing files. That's why I, again, deleted it after a short trial period.

### Reaper

There's a free unrestricted demo (which you can _technically_ use forever ...). I really like the software itself. Very powerful tools. Some strong ideas. Has always worked well for me.

It just _looks_ bad. Purely because of the bad visual design, I often have a hard time finding buttons or knowing what to do. I'm also not "excited" to learn that, as it feels more like reading an old book you don't understand.

I, therefore, use Reaper for a handful of things I _know_ how to do (by heart). It excels at that. Otherwise, I wouldn't dare create whole projects inside it.

### Waveform Free

It's free! It's a fully functional DAW, although the features are quite barebones. You can upgrade to the pro version for a small price. This will allow you to mix music professionally for free, but don't expect much more.

It looks _fine_. The workflow, however, can be unconventional or a bit of a struggle.

### Cakewalk

It's free! This software is based on an older DAW that used to be paid (and quite expensive). This makes it very versatile and feature-packed, because it's literally a continued version of a big professional DAW.

Still, I could never like it. The interface is _meh_, the workflow is _meh_. Because it's free, it lacks many great plugins or soundpacks you'd get (and need) with paid DAWs. And because it's free, it wants to install all sorts of things on your PC, which I never like.

### (AVID) Pro Tools

Yes, this used to be the industry standard for years. For some, it still is. When it comes to _workflow_ (user experience) it's not that bad. Some parts are actually great. When it comes to the _look_, I'm not that happy.

Due to _years_ of development (and being at the top), the software is bloated and stiff. It's slower and larger than it needs to be. It never tried doing things in a different or better way, stifling innovation and a friendly experience for beginners.

At the same time, why change? If it worked for the most popular albums ever, it probably works for you. I discarded it because there were cheaper and more modern tools, which seemed like a better fit for my future.

### Cubase

I received the full Cubase system for free with an equipment purchase. I installed it, I tried, and I hated it. It looks _awful_, I can't say it any other way. The workflow feels archaic and like it's meant to be a struggle.

I see no clear area in which it shines or excels.

### Conclusion

As you see, I tried most DAWs. (Using trial period, demo, or a free version received when buying equipment.) I was one of those "DAW hoppers" when I was just a kid. The ranking above feels solid and fair to me.

But you can do the same. Try different workflows. Look at the interface with your own eyes. Do you want to look at that every day? Do you immediately understand what buttons do? Set yourself a simple challenge in each software---something you do or need a lot---and see which one makes that the easiest.

_I have not tried Bitwig Studio or FL Studio, so I can't comment. I've heard good things about the first, and the interface of the second is an example of good aesthetics and visual design. That's it._
