You have a DAW and know how to use it. You have your new project open. You have _some_ way to monitor what you're doing, a workflow for listening and improving.

It's time for our first holy trinity of mixing: the **controls**. These are the three basic controls every DAW has, on every track. The thing you touch 99% of the time. If you think you can't solve a problem with these controls---think again!

They are,

* Timing
* Volume
* Panning

"Timing" will talk about making the most out of _rhythm_ (and preventing mistakes with tempo or beats). About using tools for this, like the built-in metronome. It will also talk about transitions, delay between tracks, and when removing parts of recordings is actually the right choice.

"Volume" will talk about general principles for setting all your tracks to a good volume. About the issue of "volume creep" and how to fight it. How to keep all tracks audible, without any single one overpowering another?

"Panning" will talk about placing tracks in stereo. The important concept of doubling. And how to play with this to give your mixes extra "oomph".

To me, this is the right order. Each control is crucial. But mistakes in timing are ugliest to hear and hardest to fix. After that, mistakes in volume management bring the most trouble. Panning is important, but also something you can easily change or improve later.

Each will now receive their own chapter. I added this short chapter to give you a break, and clearly signal we're starting a new section!

That's all. Let's start talking about _timing_!
