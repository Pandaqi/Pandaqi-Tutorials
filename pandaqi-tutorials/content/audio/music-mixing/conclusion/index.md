Congratulations! You've reached the end of the course on mixing! I've taught and shown you every single useful idea and practical tip I could think of. 

As always, I learned most of it by _doing_. And you will too. Apply these ideas in practice. Test them---maybe you find out they don't work at all for you and call me stupid :p By simply doing a lot of mixes, you'll learn thousands of practical tips yourself. And because _you_ learned them by making mistakes, you will never forget them.

This course discussed ...

* Why mixing is so hard: the disconnect you need to understand
* The general goal: putting a disconnected set of recordings into one, combined, natural, pretty 3D space
* The tools you'll need and how to use them. (Both DAW and Monitoring.)
* How to use the three core controls (Timing, Volume, and Panning)
* How to use the three core effects (Compression, EQ, and Reverb/Delay)
* How to mix vocals specifically or add more detail through automation

Now go and make cool music! If you have feedback, let me know. If you made something nice, let me hear it, I love that.

Keep learning,

Pandaqi

P.S. This course continues with a few "appendices" you could use as a reference.
