This guide is about how to turn music you've recorded into a finished, coherent masterpiece. Learn the basics of any DAW, how to edit and combine sounds, and how to use basic plugins and effects to enhance your song.

It's about music **mixing** and **mastering**. Editing what you already have and turning it into a final song. Check my other guides for other parts of the creative musical process:

* [Learn to sing](../../audio/singing-and-speaking/)
* [Songwriting](../../audio/songwriting/)
* [Recording](../../audio/recording/)

I'm a professional musician under the name [Tiamo el Troubadour](https://eltroubadour.com). 

I'm _far_ from perfect and have lots to learn. You'll hear that. But that's why I wrote this guide: to write down my lessons and obstacles as I recorded track after track. To help anybody else on this difficult---but hopefully rewarding---path!

I even built my own little software to give you interactive examples, right in the browser. What are you waiting for?
