This guide is about _recording_ music. This is a surprisingly complex topic, as "put a mic somewhere and start playing" just doesn't cut it---at all.

We'll talk about placement, different microphones, gain staging, and many more fundamentals of audio recording. It's about **recording** only. Check out my other guides for the other parts in the process.

I'm a professional musician under the name [Tiamo el Troubadour](https://eltroubadour.com). 

I'm _far_ from perfect and have lots to learn. You'll hear that. But that's why I wrote this guide: to write down my lessons and obstacles as I recorded track after track. To help anybody else on this difficult---but hopefully rewarding---path!
