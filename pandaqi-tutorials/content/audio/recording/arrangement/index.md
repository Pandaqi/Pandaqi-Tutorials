Your setup is ready. Your room is ready. Your song is ready ... right? Not quite. When I started recording, I thought I entered my booth well-prepared. I'd written lyrics and chords for the full song. Maybe I even _printed_ that on paper, so I didn't have to remember or look at my phone!

It wasn't enough. When you start recording, you suddenly realize there are a million more decisions to make. Just "chords" isn't enough.

What's the tempo? What's the strumming pattern? What's the instrumentation? How _long_ is the intro actually going to be? Do we add a pause between verse and chorus or not?

I kept getting stuck on these questions. I wasn't prepared for them. I realized my song ... was actually only 10% of a song.

My personality is very improvisational. I hate planning or structure. But let me tell you, I _had_ to learn how to arrange songs beforehand. Without it, recording became a mess from which I could never recover.

So what is that, arrangement?

## Arrangement

It simply means you decide on _all parts_ of a song. Not just a single take. Not just one instrument. But all the recordings, which will combine to make the full song.

You _arrange_ all the pieces you have into a final recording. This isn't "music mixing", it's more "songwriting". But it's close enough to recording that I needed to mention it here.

If you don't do this beforehand, you're likely to waste time, or throw away 50% of what you do. Because you realize you wanted a different tempo. Because you invented two melodies, but never tested if they actually work together. Because you thought you were done, then realized a week later that you forgot to record that drum that's sorely needed.

There's one song online, by me, which was recorded in the wrong tempo. It's one of the very first I ever recorded. I had an amazing take ... and only realized later that I wanted a different tempo and key. Because I was naÃ¯ve, I thought "meh, let's just transpose and edit it". It sounds _okay_, but anybody with a critical ear can tell it's been edited and sounds worse for it.

Similarly, I once spent a lot of time recording a complicated guitar piece in one go. A few days later, I hit my forehead and called myself the stupidest person alive. I could just ... split the piece into multiple parts. Multiple layers, different recordings, which _combine_ to sound similar. In fact, doing so made it sound much better.

Arrangement ensures you know _what_ to record and _how_. All recordings for the same project will fit together and go smoothly, because you thought about it _beforehand_ and decided exactly what parts you want.

Stating it like this, it hopefully becomes obvious. Good audio recording starts with being certain about _what_ to record.

## How to do it?

As mentioned, this is more [Songwriting](../../songwriting/). Check out that course, especially the Arrangement chapters at the end, for details. After that, this is more [Music Mixing](../../music-mixing/). Check out _that_ course as well! ðŸ˜‰ Yes, writing and arranging compositions is a huge area which takes a lot of skill.

But if we just focus on the _recording_ aspect, I can also give many useful tips.

### Set it all in stone

First of all, you should _have every part of the song_. The lyrics, the chords, the melody, the support, the timing, the time signature, etcetera.

Like, _really know it_. Not "the melody goes something like this ..." or "and then you do those few high notes, and then ...". You know the **pitches** and the **timing** of them.

Why? Because if you don't, you _will_ do something different every time. Which means all your takes are incompatible, which means you recorded the wrong thing. Something you can't fix with editing 99% of the time. The recording might sound amazing, but it's still the wrong thing, and thus of no value.

If needed, make your first few takes about this. Lay down the _exact_ rhythm or melody. Test a few different tempos until you find your perfect fit. Only once you're **sure** about those details, start going into "record a lot of takes of everything" mode.

_Won't that kill creativity? Inspiration?_ No. This is _recording_, not _songwriting_. Use that creativity and inspiration while writing the song, while coming up with all those details. Recording is about getting that song idea as digital audio files. Recording _while_ you're still writing the song means you're mixing two disciplines that have a clear order in which they should happen.

Sure, you can experiment. Play it as loose as you like. As I said, I like improvising (a lot)! That, however, means I create an arrangement beforehand, but _allow_ myself to deviate it if needed. If all goes wrong, I still have that arrangement to fall back on. 

There's no downside to this. You can throw your arrangement in the trash can if you have lots of inspiration or better ideas during the recording session. It's not holding you back. It's a valuable _tool_ to prevent mistakes or wasted time during the recording process.

Once you do that, you'll realize the power of **doubling** and **splitting**

### Doubling

To get that _stereo_ sound our ears like, you can record the same part multiple times. (One is panned to the left ear, one to the right ear.)

When played simultaneously, it will sound _wide_ and _three dimensional_. Because our ears hear the same thing, but slightly different, which also happens in the real world! Our head merges the two sounds and views them as coming from the _same_ source.

It's that simple. It's a "trick" that every song on earth uses in spades. It's one that's cheap and easy to execute.

All you need is _two takes_ that are almost identical, but not quite. If it's a background instrument, you can get away with even more imperfection.

When you play _too perfectly_, that's actually a problem. If the takes are practically identical, you lose this stereo effect---because our ears hear two sounds that are the SAME! You also get phase issues, which I'll cover soon.

This works on any instrument. The voice often has multiple doubles, especially in pop songs. Guitar chords absolutely _love_ this, as long as the strumming rhythm is tight (otherwise it sounds like stuttering).

The lesson? Do multiple takes of everything. Most things will sound much better when doubled. Otherwise, you can just forget the other takes and play it as a mono source.

### Splitting

This is a powerful technique that's barely mentioned. It's what I mentioned in the example above: I split a complex piece into multiple parts to record separately.

Why is this so powerful?

* It allows you to do _easier_ performances. (Less mistakes, takes less energy, easier to edit.)
* While the end result is often more beautiful and more flexible. (Splitting a melody might give new ideas or potential for recordings.)

{{% example %}}
The melody I talk about had both very high and very low notes. That's why it was so hard to play: I had to stretch my fingers the full length of the guitar. So I split it into "low guitar" and "high guitar". But now each piece was a bit boring on its own. So I added a bit of flourish to both recordings. Then, when I played them at the same time, I surprised myself by how much _better_ it sounded.
{{% /example %}}

Often, I play the main part of a song on my guitar using pretty standard chords. But then I'll record the same chords but _higher_, and a variation of the chords that emphasizes more of the _lower_ strings. Combined, it sounds like you're playing one guitar---the most beautiful one in the world. 

{{% remark %}}
When I just started, I'd often send recordings to friends and family. Until I told them about the process, they always assumed it was _one guitar_, recorded really well. This is true for 99% of songs. You think you hear a few instruments and a voice, but it's actually an _arrangement_ of multiple layers that brings out the best of the song.
{{% /remark %}}

The lesson? If something is too hard to play, or you're uncertain about the sound, split it. Usually by frequency (low, mid, high) or rhythm (slow, mid, fast). Easier recording, potential for surprising effects, more flexibility.

## Conclusion

Arrange your songs. 

* Think about _every part_ and write down every detail. No vague melodies, lyrics, or instrumentation when entering the recording booth.
* Determine your layers in advance. Which should be doubled? (Or quadrupled?) Which might be split?
* If you want multiple instruments, make sure they are available _and_ have their own parts.

This will remove errors and wasted time from your recording process. It will also teach you a lot about songwriting. It will ask your brain to not only write a song, but also think about the steps further down the line: how it will translate to a microphone (and finally a finished mix).

As the saying goes,

> A well-written song will lead to easy recording and mixing. A bad arrangement can never be saved.
