Well done! You've finished the guide on audio recording.

Hopefully, this guide helped you ...

* Get the right equipment. (Without getting useless stuff or paying too much.)
* Understand why it's so hard to record audio well, and the simple ways to combat this. (Gain staging, phase issues, monitoring, understanding microphones)
* Use the right microphone and placement for the job
* Have a good workflow for recording sessions and takes, to prevent wasting time and energy.
* Work with the four most common instruments: voice, piano, guitar and drums

I wanted to include a chapter on "ear training". While awesome, it's mostly unrelated to the skill of recording. Additionally, it's too big a topic for one chapter, and can only be explained if I build some tool for that training.

Now go and do it, a lot, make your own mistakes and learn your own lessons from that. If you also want to produce your own songs, I recommend continuing your research with the course on [Music Mixing](../../music-mixing/).

Made something nice using my tips? Send me the result, I love seeing what others do with my tutorials.

Keep learning,
