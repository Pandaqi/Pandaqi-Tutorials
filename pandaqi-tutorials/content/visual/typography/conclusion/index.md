I hope you enjoyed this course. I hope it gave insight into the magical world of typography. With the tools and ideas I've given to you, I hope you're able to start your next design confidently and pick the most awesome fonts and parameters.

As to the question *what should I do now?* I can only say: experiment and start designing! There's no "advanced typography". No huge extra secrets to uncover here.

The only part I've barely mentioned is _creating your own fonts_, but that will be a separate course. And with the huge amount of perfectly fine fonts freely available, this isn't something many designers ever need to worry about.

It's up to you now to apply the principles. Have fun!
