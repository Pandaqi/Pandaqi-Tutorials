Design is about communicating information. And how do we communicate most specifically and efficiently? Using language. 

When you read a website, you're mostly looking at letters. When you see product packaging, you're mostly looking at letters. Type fills more space than any other element in most designs.

It's a sad fact, therefore, that it's often neglected. Many people leave the font choice---and finer details of typography---until the last moment. 

This course will teach you the rules of typography, but also why you will benefit from taking it seriously.

The course moves from the *smallest* element to the *biggest* element. Every step of the way, it introduces useful terminology and principles for the given elements.

* It starts with individual *letters* (and special characters) ...
* Then it continues by combining letters into *words* ...
* Then words into *lines* ...
* Which create *text blocks* ...
* Until the course ends with how to combine good typography with *other design elements*.

You will sometimes encounter one of two special blocks:

* **Type Exercise**: a little exercise you can do to improve your skills
* **Type Error**: a common mistake people make and how to avoid it
