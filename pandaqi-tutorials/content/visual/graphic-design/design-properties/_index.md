This is the second section of the course on [Graphic Design](../../graphic-design/). It is about design **properties**. When you have an element on the page (like a line), what _properties_ can we change to achieve what we want? Think about colour, line thickness, texture, fill, and more.

It is equally short as the previous section. Yes, there are infinite ways to modify a simple rectangle to be anything else. This course, however, only teaches the most useful and fundamental properties, and what happens when you change them. This course is about the general idea of graphic design, not the details. 

Check out the other [Visual](/tutorials/visual) courses to go more in-depth. For example, color received its own course with [Colour Theory](../../colour-theory/).
