Welcome to the section about design properties. The introduction to this course already explained the general idea about graphic design that you should always keep in the back of your head.

Whenever you read a chapter, or a new principle, think about this. For what _purpose_ would this be useful? For what _purpose_ would this be a terrible choice? In what settings would I use this visual principle?

Knowledge about design is useless if it's only abstract or theoretical. If possible, try to immediately apply what you learn to your own test projects.
