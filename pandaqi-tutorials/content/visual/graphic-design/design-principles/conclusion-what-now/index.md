weight: 30
type: "article"
quiz:
  - type: terms
    terms:
    - gestalt principles
    - abstraction
    - alignment
    - composition
    - contrast
    - figure-ground
    - framing
    - grid
    - grouping
    - hierarchy
    - layering
    - proportions
    - proximity
    - repetition
    - space
    - symmetry
    - asymmetry
    - tension
    - motion
    - no near misses
    options:
    - principles from psychology about how our eyes perceive visual stimuli
    - the need to simplify associations to the real world for our designs
    - pushing elements against the same implied line to group them
    - a fancy name for all the elements in your design
    - using (extreme) differences between properties of elements, which our eye loves
    - the two main layers of a design, foreground and background
    - the outer edge that every area of a design automatically creates
    - using a basic pattern of lines and intersections that helps apply all other (gestalt) principles
    - clearly communicating which elements of a design belong together, and which don't
    - structuring information based on importance and subordinate relations
    - building your hierarchy in multiple steps, to be more flexible and structured, or blend shapes
    - using a simple formula to decide the scale for each element in a design
    - using the distance between elements to group or distinguish them
    - implying motion, tension, symmetry or texture through copying an element and moving it
    - the empty area ( = ground) around your figure
    - balance created by matching location, rotation of size
    - balance created through non-symmetric properties, like colour and number
    - something that makes the viewer uncomfortable, because two elements pull equally on each other
    - something that seems to move, using lines, repetition, or tension that resolves itself
    - either make something identical, or significantly different

Pfew, that was a long course. I don't think any more can be said about graphic design. 

I also understand it might have been technical or theoretical at many points. I'm glad you stuck it through. That's why I mentioned, at the start, you should view this mostly as a "quickstart" and then as a "reference".

Because real skill and understanding comes from _applying_ all this to numerous projects. Never from reading a text or looking at images showing design principles.

From this point, you should do two things:

* Start designing and practicing with the tools I gave you
* Look at specializations. 

The first one helps these tools become second nature to you. The second will give you advanced, specific design knowledge. 

For example, you could look further into logo design, or learn absolutely everything there is to know about typography. Or the colour red, if you want to be that specialized.

If you're ever stuck, here are some design exercises to do:

-   **Restricted Library:** Set yourself some strong and some subtle restrictions, such as a fixed grid or limited colour palette, and see what you can do with them. Simply take a piece of text or an illustration, and make an awesome design out of it, within the restrictions you set yourself.
-   **Dailies:** Create a simple design every day, for a relatively long period of time. Start with a simple idea, such as "keep a journal" and design the text you write (or things you draw). Then, every subsequent day, change the parameters or restrictions a little, and create another simple design. These should not be time consuming---instead, they will teach you how to design something unique very quickly, even when your inspiration well is dry.
-   **Persona Portraits:** Develop a fictitious persona, however complex you want it to be. A name, appearance, and character traits should do. Then, design something about that character, through the lens of the character. For example, the person could be very scared of squirrels---use your knowledge of line and shape and design principles to show this fear.

As I said at the start, there's another large part of design: *usability* or sometimes called *user experience*. This course has only been about graphical design, which is only one (small) part of designing anything. I recommend reading all the other [Visual](/tutorials/visual/) courses to fill in the other gaps, and check in regularly if a new one was added.

I hope to have been of service to you. Keep designing, Pandaqi.
