This is the third section of the course on [Graphic Design](../../graphic-design/). It is about design **principles**. 

The first two sections were about **elements** and their **properties**. Guess what this last section does? It _combines_ them.

Design principles are ideas about how multiple elements can best be combined into the final design. It's by far the longest section of the course, because it's also the most important and varied concept.

It's easy to explain a rectangle. It's easy to place one on a page. It's less straightforward when a design needs hundreds of rectangles and you still need to make it look _clear_ and _good_.
