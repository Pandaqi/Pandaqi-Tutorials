This is the first section of the course on [Graphic Design](../../graphic-design/). It is about design **elements**. The actual strokes and shapes you place on the page. 

It's very short. When you break it down to the fundamentals, there aren't many different building blocks to use: only points, lines and shapes. Variety in design comes from _combining_ them in all sorts of ways. That's what the other two sections on graphic design---which you should read after this one---are about.
