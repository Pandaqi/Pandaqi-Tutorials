You've learnt everything! You are the Master of Drawing! Nah, I'm just kidding, of course. You've learnt all the fundamentals of drawing and probably a bit more than that.

But I don't expect you to be a master painter now. As I said at the start, most of your drawing skills come from *practice* and actually *applying* all these principles. The core of drawing is the right mind-set and intuition, combined with personal style that makes drawings _different_ from just taking a photograph.

Because this course is so general, I do encourage you to look into more specific styles or subjects now. If you want to draw cartoon strips, read a course wholly focused on cartoons. If you want to draw cats, read a course on that (or one on animals in general).

Alternatively, if you just want to use your drawing skills as an aid in any visual design process, I encourage you to read my [other courses in the Visual category](/tutorials/visual/).

I wish you the best of luck for now. And practice, practice, practice!
