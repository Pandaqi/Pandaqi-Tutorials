Drawing is a fundamental skill, but unfortunately often neglected. Being able to create striking, beautiful or helpful visuals can prove useful for any project or job. 

This course discusses the fundamentals. It provides a complete picture of the art of drawing, but doesn't go into much detail on topics other than the basics. Because, ultimately, the only way to really learn to draw is by practicing!

(I can't draw that well myself. I made this course to practice and teach it to myself. Hopefully, this means the examples don't feel "out of reach" or "too perfect", but like something _you_ could also achieve.)
