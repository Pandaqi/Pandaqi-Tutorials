Colour is everywhere. Whatever you make, it is going to have a colour. Websites, newspapers, magazines, movies---they are all in their most primitive form a collection of colours. Just some blobs, some pixels, some strokes, with one colour.

That's why I created a separate course only on colour theory. It's meant as a supplementary read to [the other courses on Visuals](/tutorials/visuals/).

What will you learn in this (relatively short) course?

* Why black and white aren't colours ... except when they are
* About color spaces: the range of colors we can actually pick based on our medium
* How to pick colours that work well together
* What emotions and associations general colors bring with them
* How to apply all this to any other design

Let's get started!
