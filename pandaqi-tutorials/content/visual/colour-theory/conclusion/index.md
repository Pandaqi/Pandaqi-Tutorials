Well done! You've learned all about colour theory. Another tool to add to your toolkit, now that you understand how colour works and why, and the main mistakes you need to avoid.

In general, you don't need amazing colour schemes. You just need something that's _not terrible_. Hopefully this course prevents clashing colors or miscommunicated moods.

More specifically, you should now know:

* The different models and how to keep their strengths in mind (or switch if needed)
* The different formats for defining or entering colours into the computer
* How to change a hue into different tints and shades
* How to use that + the colour wheel (and some simple rule) to create harmonious palettes
* How to pick the right base colour for the emotion you want to portray
* And how to use these colours to make a design more beautiful _and_ more clear, by grouping and codifying the right parts

As I said, this is just a primer. Just with this knowledge, you can create strong palettes, and know _when_ and _how_ to use them. But colour is just one tiny part of visuals. All the other parts can be found in the [other visual courses](/tutorials/visuals/).

Like most tutorials on this website, use this as a reference. I don't expect you to have all the colour associations memorized by now---and you shouldn't. 

Instead, the next time you start a project and think "okay, this is for a summer project, which colours do I use?", quickly check [that chapter](/tutorials/visuals/colour-theory/emotions-and-meaning) in the course to find a good starting point. 

And next time you think "I have my base colour; how did I create the rest of the palette again?", check [that chapter](/tutorials/visuals/colour-theory/harmonies-and-relationships).

Best of luck, Pandaqi
