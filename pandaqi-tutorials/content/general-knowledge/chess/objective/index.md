The objective of chess is to **checkmate** your opponent. Obviously, this needs to happen before they have checkmated _you_.

What does this mean?

* Place your pieces in such a way
* That your opponent's king is **under attack**
* And your opponent has **no legal moves left**

## Under attack?

Something is under attack if it can be captured the next turn.

## Capturing?

When you move a piece into s quare that's occupied by a piece from your _opponent_, you capture it. 

* Take the opponent's piece off the board
* Place your own piece on that square!

In other words, only _one_ piece can be on a square. If a second one arrives, it removes the first from the board. But you can't capture your own pieces.

## Legal Moves?

This depends on the specific piece. Next chapter explaines each piece and its possible moves.

But there's one general important rule here:

> If your *king* is under attack (**checked**), your next move needs to make sure he isn't anymore. 

In other words, the king may never be captured. So if they are under attack, you _have_ to solve that attack on your turn.

And if you can't do that? Then all requirements for **checkmate** have been reached and you've lost the game.

Here's a preview of what you'll learn in this course. How do you uncheck your king? Three ways:

* Simply moving it out of the way
* Capturing the piece that's threatening it
* Putting a piece between the king and it's attacker, blocking the line of attack

## Draw

Sometimes there's no winner. Then the game ends in a **draw** and both players get equal points.

This occurs in 5 situations:

-   There are not enough pieces left on the board to checkmate. (Example: if both players only have a king left, you obviously can't threaten each other anymore and nobody can win.)
-   **Stalemate:** a player can't do a legal move, but his king isn't under attack. (In other words: one requirement for checkmate is satisfied, but the other isn't.)
-   If both players see that a situation is hopeless, they can (verbally) agree on a draw.
-   If the exact same board position has occurred three times in the game, a player *can* say that it's a draw.
-   If 50 moves have been played, in which none of the players have moved a pawn or captured a piece.

The first three options are more common than the last two.

*Stalemate* is something that needs a little special attention. Even if you have all your pieces left, and the opponent has only his king left, a stalemate is a draw. Even if you are clearly winning, a stalemate is an immediate draw.

Therefore, a smart player who is losing will always try to force a stalemate. Pay attention to that.
