Hi! I'm **Pandaqi**. My real name is _Tiamo Pastoor_. I'm a guy passionate about games, music, being creative, and trying to get the most out of life.

{{% image src="mijn_gezicht.webp" class="float-right" alt="A picture of my face!" %}}

I live in the Netherlands, in a small town called Waalre where I spent _most_ of my youth. English is, therefore, my second language. About 50% of my work is only available in Dutch. (Keep that in mind when looking up other projects of mine.)

I absolutely hated the educational system from start to finish. I was forced to study Mathematics, and the only good thing about that is that it ended at some point. This tutorial website was my statement that I'm not against _learning_, that I'm not _stupid_ or _lazy_, but that the educational system is worthless and wrong.

The website itself is quite old. It was my first big, professional website. It underwent several major updates, until eventually landing as part of my overall game studio website. This latest iteration is very modern and clean, and will hopefully stand the test of time. (Mostly because I'm too busy now to maintain this so frequently ðŸ˜‰)

Once I was done with education---I'm officially a "Mathematical engineer", but never even went to get my degree---I became a **freelance artist**.

Below are links to all my other projects. I hope they give you joy. And I hope you give my paid work a chance if that is the case, as it is how I make my living.

My work spans four major areas: **writing, design, games/programming,** and **music**. I taught myself all of that. I even skipped third grade because I could already read---thank you, Harry Potter books lying around!---when we were supposed to _start learning how to read_.

However, due to a chronic illness, I had to spend years mostly focusing on _writing_ and _programming_. As that's all you can do when your body barely works. This website, for example, had support for videos and sound from day one, but not a single tutorial currently uses it.

The illness is most likely the result of my stress and depression because of the educational system. I say this as advice and a warning. Your youth is the most _critical_ moment for the development of your health. Schooling in most countries basically means you spend 20 years stressed-out, overworked, bossed around and very unhappy. 

This has consequences. You might never lose the mental or physical issues that come with it.

So my advice? If you're still in school, really, _really_, ignore all the bullshit it tries to force on you and just _take care of your goddamn health_. Mentally and physically. Teach yourself skills you're passionate about. Maintain social relations, sport activities, relaxing activities. Don't be afraid to tell everyone at school to fuck off, because _you_ care about yourself and your life, and _they_ have no right to treat you like a slave that should do anything they say.

These are the only swear words you'll find on all my online websites and content. 

I use them only when they are most needed.

And if you're already out of school? Reconsider all your habits, thoughts, personality traits, etcetera and find which ones are the result of that system. The result of the stress or situation from your youth. Try to break free from them. Try something else. You will discover just how much those first ~18 years of your life shackle you to an unhealthy lifestyle and mindset.
