For any skill, there are _many_ books and tutorials. The number of "learning websites", both free and paid, both high-quality and amateurish, is near infinite.

So why use this website? Why did I even create this website? Surely I cannot compete---on my lonesome---with big companies and paid courses.

Here are my "unique selling points".

* I am completely independent. I will never advertise. Or endorse a product or software because I was paid for it. Or say something for any other reason than _I believe it and want to say it_.
* I think this website is very fast, clean, modern and pretty. It is more flexible and easy to update, beacuse I stay lean.
    * Many tutorial websites focus either too much on content (leading to ugly unusable websites) or on flashy effects (leading to unreadable content).
* I insert personal anecdotes, funny remarks, and other signs of life and humanity. I try to never overdo it. In general, however, personality and style is important when teaching. Perhaps more important than the content.
* My style of teaching is very different from other styles. Let me explain ...

I've thought about how to optimize learning since I was (very) young. My tutorials, therefore, do not follow the general ideas about teaching. (Ideas that are mostly a result from the rigid educational systems around the globe.)

I don't pretend a piece of text can actually teach you anything. That's why ...

* I add images, quizzes, examples, interactivity where it is sensible
* I only try to give you a _good start_ and an _intuition_ for a skill
* And then my tutorials are simply a reference you can use _while practicing that skill_

A website like this is _amazing_ as a reference. It's also great at using different media to give you a better understanding of something.

All other parts of "learning" cannot happen through a tutorial. So I don't try to force that. All the other learning comes from trying stuff yourself, in the real world, over and over, until you get better ðŸ˜Š

And as always: if you have trouble, or spot errors, let me know. I am a real human being maintaining this website. I _will_ make mistakes. And I _will_ listen to feedback.
