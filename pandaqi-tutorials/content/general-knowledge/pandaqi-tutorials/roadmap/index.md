This is a passion project. I don't make any money off of it and don't intend to. I wanted to share knowledge with the world, help others, create a nice place for all that.

This means that the roadmap below is more of a "wishlist in a sensible order". I might execute half the list the coming year, I might not touch this website for five years. Who knows?

## Programming Courses

Transfer all the old programming courses. That's a _lot_ (hundreds of chapters), mostly focused on web development. They were also filled with countless examples and images, which is why it takes so long to transfer them.

Also write a new course on "programming principles". Wise lessons you should apply to _any_ software project. I think that course would be more valuable than all the others combined. No, I am _certain_ of it!

Finally, I started using many different tools after all those years. I'd recommend the _Hugo_ website generator in a heartbeat. I'm using more and more _command line_ tools. Everything I write happens in _Markdown_. Each of those topics would be nice to cover.

## Music Theory

I'd like to create a big, interactive course on "Music Theory".

Speaking of interactivity ...

## More interactivity

Many of the older courses have no interactivity at all. Some have images or quizzes, but even that feels like the bare minimum.

At the same time, there's a point at which you should just _make a game_ instead of turning a website into a "fake game".

I know, I'm being a perfectionist. I already put way too much time into this. That's why this is on my _wishlist_, and not actually made yet.

### Typography
The [Typography](../../../visual/typography/) course is nice. Almost every chapter has a quiz. It has clear images. But the real way to learn something is through interactivity! I should add some buttons, some tiny games, some interactive stuff inside the course. It shouldn't be too hard to allow readers to actually _play_ with font size, line height, spacing, and other typography concepts.

### Writing
Some simple tool that counts words, checks sentence length, gives a readability index---should be doable. Besides that, I might create some "writing prompt" generator.

### Visual

If I ever get around to more tutorials about video editing, graphics, etcetera, I could also add a barebones **animation editor** or **vector graphics** app. (Nothing actually fancy, of course. Just enough to let you _play_ with the concepts I explain. Simple things like keyframes, tweening, etcetera.)

## To infinity and beyond

Beyond this? Who knows. I can't imagine what else I really _have_ to cover. (I have something to add that's nowhere else on the internet, or I really _want_ to talk in-depth about it.)

But I'll see you back here in ten years. The world has probably changed dramatically, and me with it.
