Welcome to the FAQ! Where we pretend I get these questions _all the time_, instead of them being things that confused one person sometime in the past decennium. (This website has been online for some time.)

## Why no comments or social media buttons?

The number of people actually reading something, thinking "hey, I want to share this", and then _not doing it_ because a fast social media button is missing on the page ... is practically nonexistent.

They'd be a lot of visual noise on an otherwise clean website, for little benefit.

Same with comments. Enabling them for each tutorial again destroys the clean and simple nature of the website. Enabling them per course will probably mean visitors miss it, or discussion is all over the place. This is a static website, so I'd need custom tricks to add comments anyway. In the end, the advantages don't outweigh the disadvantages.

## How often is content updated?

The bulk of the content was written around 2016, then updated over time as I became a better writer, or learned new things.

Completely new courses weren't added for a _long_ time. But now (since 2023) I have more free time and a clear plan, so new courses will appear more quickly.

Even so, if you find a mistake or something outdated, let me know. Small mistakes are easily fixed. And it motivates me to bump those errors (which put visitors at a disadvantage) to the top of the priority list.

## How do you know so much?

I don't. Writing tutorials is my way of _learning_ things. Afterwards, I use my own website as _documentation_ or _reference_ to reread things I've forgotten.

Besides that, visit [How to use this website](../how-to-use-this-website/), where I explain the process of teaching yourself anything. And how it's the complete opposite of what most people are taught at school.

## Why did you make this?

Because I have these tutorials anyway. Same with my "devlogs" or "diaries": I write to sort my thoughts, learn things, solve problems. I have these nicely written documents anyway, why not share them with the world?

The original version was also just a way to practice coding and maintaining websites. It was my first big, professional, paid venture into the web world.

Now it's also somewhat a marketing tool. This website has _many_ visitors. They will find my other work now, if they deem the tutorials good enough.

In any case, it has no ads and the current content has taken _a lot of time_ to make. So I'm actually losing money and it's often quite stressful to produce high-quality, error-free content about anything.

The best answer to the question is perhaps: "because I care about people freeing themselves from educational institutions and teaching themselves skills they are passionate about---no matter the cost to me"

## How did you make this?
The toolset:

* The free [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static website generator. 
* The free [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (by Microsoft) editor. (First tutorials were written in Microsoft Word, then copied and modified for HTML. A terrible system, don't use it.)
* Years and years of building websites to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and general programming practices.
* Adobe Illustrator and later [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/) for drawing the illustrations.
* A crappy old laptop---actually still the laptop from my university, it's that old---and dedication
* Watching and reading English content all day when I was young, to learn the language.
