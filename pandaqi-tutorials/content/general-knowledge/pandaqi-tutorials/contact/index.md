I'm old-school. Mail me at [schoolofpanda@gmail.com](mailto:schoolofpanda@gmail.com)

Other websites might provide alternative mailing addresses or platforms. They will probably work, though the one above is definitely the one you should try.

My online presence comes from the many **huge** websites I maintain. I have no energy or motivation to waste time on the newest social media trend on top of that ðŸ™Š

I do have an account on [itch.io](https://itch.io), so you can leave comments on my games or send a message _about games_ there. I also have a YouTube and Twitter account under the same name, for the same reason.

My creative writing efforts have, so far, mostly used Dutch as the primary language. So I'm afraid those communication channels are only available if you know that language.

I _love_ getting feedback or user stories. Just let me know when you've used or bought something of mine. Even if you're very critical, or have nothing to comment, I like knowing the people using my work and their story.
