I'm old-school. Mail me at [harmonize@pandaqi.com](mailto:harmonize@pandaqi.com). All my other websites have a custom email address too, all of which are called "harmonize"!

I love getting feedback or user stories, and it happens far too rarely! Just let me know when you've used or bought something of mine. Even if you're very critical, or have nothing to comment, I like knowing the people using my work and their story.

I can't really be contacted or followed anywhere else. My online presence comes from the many **huge** websites I maintain. I have no energy or motivation to waste time on the newest social media trend on top of that.

I do have an account on [itch.io](https://itch.io), so you can leave comments on my games or send a message about **games** there. I also have a YouTube and Twitter account under the same name, for the same reason.

My **books** can be bought on all the major stores, and should be automatically getting pages on major book forums (such as GoodReads). You might discuss things there, and I might see it.

I also run [a Dutch webshop](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl). In the future, a larger international online store will be launched that will sell both physical and digital goods related to _all_ my work. This includes educational material. No, this free tutorial website will not disappear or be paywalled. I took this decision very reluctantly, and I only sell _new_ work in that online store that I consider non-essential.
