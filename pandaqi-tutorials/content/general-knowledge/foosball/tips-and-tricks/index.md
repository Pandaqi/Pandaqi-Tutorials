Congratulations! You have finished this guide. You know the rules, you know to control and pass the ball, and you know how to shoot and defend from all positions.

It's time to develop your own playing style. Develop some things that _you_ can execute perfectly almost 100% of the time. Develop some unique ways to control, pass, or attack, that will take opponents time to get used to.

First of all, keep in mind **pace and surprise**. Changes in speed and action throw off your opponents. Sometimes you can take it very *very* slow, and then suddenly accelerate. You can slowly pass the ball between men for a few seconds, and then suddenly shoot. Or the other way around, quickly tic-tac the ball and then do a slow angled ( = spray) shot. 

And perhaps you've done the same shot 10 times this match---now try something else to surprise the others. 

Play with a different rhythm than your opponent. Force the opponent to follow _your_ rhythm. If you feel you're uncomfortable, or pressured, or out of your depth, the best thing is to _calm down_ and _completely change your tactics_. Otherwise, you keep dancing to the opponent's tune.

Try to **read the enemy**. Try to figure out their playing style, their best or favourite tricks, their way of defending---and then adapt. 

For example, I've taught you the best defensive positionin. But a smart player will see that you constantly use these tactics. They won't even bother trying some shots anymore, but will move straight to the few shots that do work!

And now just _play a lot of games_ and _practice_! 

Keep playing foosball,
