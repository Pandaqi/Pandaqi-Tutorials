# Courses (to do)

## Writing

**Markdown:** just the basics of writing in markdown

**Writing with Style:** EXISTING, but could be much improved to add tips for short and clean writing. Also, better title. => This one is about the *language usage*

**Writing better stories:** everything I know about how to plot, write characters, finish novels, etcetera => These ones are about *storytelling*

> Nah, split it into *multiple* courses. Easier to write, easier to digest, it's such a huge topic. => World building, Characters, Plot, Drafting, Action scenes, Mysteries, etcetera

**Dutch:** maybe one about learning Dutch?

**Guide to self-publishing?**

**Discussion on workflow/software?**

## Visual

?? About using vector software? Vector illustration?

**Pixel Art** seems a good one. This category could mostly use tutorials on specific *styles* and *tools*. As "graphic design" and "drawing" already did the basics that apply everywhere. => Would also be able to include a **nice tool for drawing pixel art** (right inside the browser)

**Icons & Branding (yes!)**

**Usability**

**Film/video stuff** would also be part of this.

## Audio

**Music Theory:** general *practical* guide to music theory?

## Programming

**Programming Principles:** tips for how to program *well*

### Websites

**Hugo**: how to get started with Hugo and why static websites are amazing.

**Command Line**? **Git?**

**TypeScript:** why it's great and how to get started with it. (Not sure if it should be part of *games* though.)

### Games

**Phaser:** EXISTING, but should update and improve.

More **specific** tutorials on creating games? Like "how to create a platformer"? Nah, don't think I'll ever have the motivation to make that. Instead, create general courses like

-   **How to structure a game project**

-   **How to design great games**

**Babylon.js**

**Defold Game Engine**

**Orx**

**Lua? Love2d?**

**Bevy!**
