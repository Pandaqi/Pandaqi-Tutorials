 "The CSS3 Guide" post: "\<p>CSS is the programming language for layout and design, and it stands for Cascading Style Sheets. \<strong>Style sheets\</strong> refer to the CSS files that tell a browser how to
\<em>style\</em> certain elements, while \<strong>cascading\</strong> simply means that the browser chooses which rules to apply depending on their syntax and placement. (Don't worry, the concept of cascading is explained in detail in the \<em>Priorities &amp; Inheritance\</em> chapter.)\</p> \<p>You've probably just learned HTML, and are eager to know how you can make all those tags look good. Well, this is the guide for you! You can do virtually anything with CSS, and most of the functionality is supported in all major ('modern') browsers. In fact, you'll spend much more time playing with CSS than HTML when building a website.\</p> \<p>You want some nice colours? CSS! You want animations when hovering over something? CSS! You want different fonts and typography? You get the idea. CSS is simple, clear, capable\-\--there's really no reason \<em>not\</em> to learn it.\</p> \<p>CSS3 is the latest version of this amazing language, and probably the last one.
\<em>Why?!\</em> Because since this version, all functionality is created as \<em>modules\</em>. These modules can be adopted by browsers one at a time, and all fit nicely together, which means the language keeps growing and growing. Therefore, even though this is the third version of CSS, you should just look at it as being \<em>the\</em> only CSS there is. This guide will try to talk you through
\<em>everything\</em> that is CSS. But, as that is a bit much, the focus lies on the basics and the most commonly used functionality. There's only one fundamental syntax, which means that most of the chapters just show you different ways to fill it in, instead of introducing completely different concepts.

"CSS3" video: "" diff: 1 quiz: "" - id: 193 title: "\[CSS3\] Linking CSS & HTML" post: "\<p>Without HTML elements, CSS can't do anything. Therefore, the first step is to link an HTML document with a set of CSS rules. Three ways for doing this are available to us:
\<strong>inline styles, style element\</strong> and an external
\<strong>style sheet\</strong>. I highly recommend the last one, but the first two also have their uses (and are quite common), so I will discuss all three options.\</p> \<h2>Inline Styles\</h2> \<p>Inline styles are embedded within the HTML document itself. Every HTML element can take the \<code>style\</code> \<strong>attribute\</strong>, which takes CSS code as value.\</p> \<pre data-lang="html"\> \<!\-- Makes this element's text colour red \--\> \<p style="color:red"\>Some styled text!\</p> \</pre> \<p>Therefore, anything you write there applies to this specific element only, and can't be easily copied or changed. Because of these major downsides, I recommend against this technique. It is, however, cleaner and faster in cases where you want to style a very specific element in an unique way (for example, a single letter in an article that you want a certain colour that you don't use anywhere else).\</p> \<h2>Style Element\</h2> \<p>The \<code>\<style>\</code> tag can be put in the head section of an HTML document, and all its content will be parsed as CSS code. Basically, this allows you to use all the functionality that CSS provides in the same way as external style sheets would. But, it's still embedded within the HTML, which means that you'd have to copy the code between documents if you want them to have the same style.\</p> \<pre data-lang="html"\> \<style type="text/css"\> /\* CSS Code Here \*/ \</style> \</pre> \<p>Only use this when you really have no other choice, or it's a very small project with only one file.\</p> \<h2>Style Sheet\</h2> \<p>The last option is to put all the CSS code in an external file, which carries the extension
\<code>.css\</code>. Then, use the \<code>\<link>\</code> tag to link it to an HTML file. This link tag is also put in the head section, as style sheets are not part of the content but \<em>describe\</em> the page.\</p> \<pre data-lang="html"\> \<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="linktostylesheet.css"\> \</pre> \<p>The
\<code>rel\</code> attribute defines what relation the linked file has with the HTML file. It is always necessary, because other file types could also be linked, and HTML wants to know.\</p> \<p>Style sheets can be easily shared among multiple HTML files, can apply the same style to all sorts of groups of elements, and are usually \<em>cached\</em> by browsers (which means they are saved and don't need to be reloaded every time a user visits a webpage). As you can see, external style sheets are the way to go!\</p> \<h2>Final Note\</h2> \<p>In this course, all code examples can be viewed in the live html editor by hovering over them and clicking the button that appears. As this is a pure CSS tutorial, however, we focus on that, and you'll have to write some HTML tags yourself to test out the code. See it as an educational exercise!\</p> " slug: "css3-linking-html" cat: "Website" subcat:

\<strong>selector\</strong>, which is then followed by one or multiple
\<strong>declarations\</strong>.\</p> \<p>The role of the selector is to select a certain group of elements (for example, all \<code>\<p>\</code> tags), while the declarations \<em>declare\</em> what style is assigned to those elements. Opening and closing braces are used to show when a certain group of declarations starts and ends.\</p> \<p>\<img src="media/CSS3SelectorsDeclarations.png" />\</p> \<p>Selectors can be built from many small items with a certain functionality, which will all be discussed in the next chapter.\</p> \<h2>Declarations\</h2> \<p>Every declaration consists of two elements: \<strong>property\</strong> and
\<strong>value\</strong>. The property and value are connected with a colon, and a semicolon is placed at the end to signal the end of the declaration.\</p> \<p>The property determines \<em>what\</em> exactly of the element is being styled.

\<em>how\</em> the property is being styled/altered.

You only need to provide the declarations.\</p> \<h2>Comments\</h2> \<p>Just as with HTML, or any computer language really, CSS offers you the possibility to add comments within your code. These comments have no influence at all on the page - they are simply there to remind yourself about what certain parts do, or certain bugs you still need to fix.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> /\* This is a comment It can span multiple lines \*/ \</pre> \<h2>That's It!\</h2> \<p>This is all the syntax there is. The rest of this course, with the exception of the next chapter, is about all the different existing properties and the values they can take. All declarations can be applied to all elements, but some are specific to certain elements and don't affect others. Nevertheless, CSS will never throw errors if you do something wrong\-\--it will just do the best it can with what you give it. Most of the times CSS provides an elegant solution to a problem, but sometimes you'll need to exploit some of the oddities or of the language\-\--we like to call those things \<em>CSS hacks\</em>. Therefore, there are usually multiple ways to do something, and sometimes they require extra HTML elements and/or some advanced CSS magic.

You can combine these in any way you like, and in any number. You could write a rule that selects all
\<code>p\</code> (paragraph tags) that are direct children of
\<code>div\</code>, or select every \<code>input\</code> with
\<code>\<attr>type\</attr>="text"\</code>, or even select a specific
\<code>span\</code> tag ten levels deep in some HTML structure. The possibilities are endless!\</p> \<h2>Universal Selector\</h2> \<p>Let's start off simple. The asterisk ( \<code>\*\</code> ) selects \<em>every element\</em>. This is useful, for example, if you want to set a base font family for the entire page.\</p> \<h2>Element Selector\</h2> \<p>To select all tags of a certain kind, you simply use the tag name without the \<code>\<\</code> and \<code>\>\</code> around it.\</p> \<p class="indented"\>For example: \<code>\<p>\</code> becomes
\<code>p\</code>, \<code>\<h1>\</code> becomes \<code>h1\</code> \<pre data-lang="css"\> /\* Selects all paragraph elements \*/ p { color:red; } /\* Selects all input elements \*/ input { font-size:24px;
} \</pre> \<h2>ID and Class Selector\</h2> \<p>In the HTML tutorial, we've already seen the \<strong>id\</strong> and
\<strong>class\</strong> attributes that are available to every element.\</p> \<p>The idea is that every \<em>id\</em> is
\<strong>unique\</strong>. Only one element can have a certain id.\</p>
\> To select the element with a certain id, use
\<code>#theIDName\</code> \<p>If you want multiple elements to have the same styling rules applied, you use \<em>class\</em>. You can give as many elements as you want the same class name.\</p> \> To select all elements in a certain class, use \<code>.theClassName\</code> \<pre data-lang="css"\> /\* Selects the element with ID panda \*/ #panda { color:red; } /\* Selects all elements with class panda \*/ .panda { font-size:24px; } \</pre> \<h2>Attribute Selector\</h2> \<p>The last option is to select elements based on their attributes. Such a selector is enclosed within brackets, and can do two things:\</p> \> Select everything that has a certain \<em>attribute\</em>:
\<code>\[attribute\]\</code> \> Select everything that has a certain attribute set to a certain \<em>value\</em>:
\<code>\[\<attr>attribute\</attr>=value\]\</code> \<pre data-lang="css"\> /\* Selects all elements with the src attribute set
\*/ \[src\] { color:red; } /\* Selects all elements with the src attribute set, with a value of panda.jpg \*/ \[src="panda.jpg"\] { font-size:24px; } \</pre> \<h2>Element-Specific Selectors\</h2> \<p>The last two categories can be combined with element selectors. To select a specific element with a certain ID, Class or Attribute, you simply put all the components right after each other. For example:\</p> \>
\<code>a.coolLink\</code> selects all anchor tags with a class
\<em>coolLink\</em> \> \<code>input\[type="password"\]\</code> selects all password input tags. \<p>You are also allowed to use as many ID, Class and Attribute selectors after each other in this manner. The possibilities are endless! But, more than two of these after each other is very uncommon, because it's often just more complex than necessary.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> /\*Selects the anchor element with ID coolLink, all span elements with class panda, and all text input fields \*/ a#coolLink, span.panda, input\[type="text"\] { color:red; }
\</pre> \<h2>Connecting the Dots\</h2> \<p>Putting them directly next to each other doesn't work for everything, and most components need to be connected in another way. They can be separated by white space or a few predetermined special characters, and what you put between them largely determines how the selector functions. I've put together a nice table for you. \<table> \<tbody> \<tr> \<td> \<p>Selector\</p> \</td> \<td>
\<p>Description\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>\<em>elem1\</em>, \<em>elem2\</em>\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td>

196 title: "\[CSS3\] Priorities & Inheritance" post: "\<p>When two selectors target the same element(s), we speak of \<em>conflicting styles\</em>. So, with all those different possibilities and style rules, how does CSS decide what styles to use (in the end)?\</p>
\<p>Well, there's two concepts that play a role here:
\<strong>inheritance \</strong>(style rules that are automatically applied) and \<strong>specificity \</strong>(how specific the selector is).\</p> \<h2>Inheritance\</h2> \<p>All HTML elements come with a standard design\-\--a CSS declaration for every known property. These are the same among all modern browsers, and most of those properties are set to the expected settings. For example, text alignment is automatically left for all elements. Setting a CSS property to the value
\<code>initial\</code> will always reset it to what it automatically was.\</p> \<p>On top of that, elements can inherit styles from
\<em>all\</em> their parents. Some properties automatically do this, but you can always force it by setting a property to the value
\<code>inherit\</code>. For example, if you make all the text inside a certain element red, you can easily extend these styles to all children nodes by using this value. Now, if you were to change the text colour of that element, all children would automatically follow along!\</p>
\<p>All properties can have those two values, which also means that they can cause unexpected 'bugs'. If something doesn't style the way it should, it's possible that it automatically inherits styles that overrule whatever you wrote.\</p> \<h2>Specificity\</h2> \<p>CSS selects
\<strong>the most specific selector\</strong>, which depends on two things: placement and content.\</p> \<h2>Placement\</h2> \<p>Placement means that, if two selectors are equally specific, CSS chooses the
\<strong>last selector\</strong> it finds, reading the style sheet from top to bottom.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p { color:red; } p { color:blue; } /\* All paragraphs will have text colour blue \*/ \</pre>
\<p>Inline styles are read even later by CSS, because they are embedded within the HTML, and \<strong>always\</strong> overrule everything. That's why you need to be careful with inline styles.\</p>
\<h2>Content\</h2> \<p>There's actually a little formula you can calculate specificity with, using all elements within a selector. In this case, a higher score means it is more specific, and is more likely to be chosen by CSS as the final declarations. Each component in a selector is given a specificity score according to this table:\</p>
\<table> \<tbody> \<tr> \<td> \<p>Component\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>In Code\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Score\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td> \<p>ID Selector\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>\<code>#something\</code>\</p> \</td>
\<td> \<p>100\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td> \<p>Class selector\</p>
\</td> \<td> \<p>\<code>.something\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>10\</p>
\</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td> \<p>Anything else\</p> \</td> \<td>
\<p>\<code>something\</code>,
\<code>\[something="something"\]\</code>, &hellip;\</p> \</td> \<td>
\<p>1\</p> \</td> \</tr> \</tbody> \</table> \<p> \</p> \<p>The formula is: \<em>add up the specificity score of all elements.\</em>\</p> \> For example: \<code>p div span\</code> has score 3, while \<code>#mainStuff span\</code> has score 101. Therefore, span elements within the element with ID \<code>#mainStuff\</code> will be styled according to what belongs to the second selector. \<pre data-lang="css"\> #mainContent p
.firstSentence { font-family:Helvetica; } #mainContent p { font-family:Arial; } /\* Paragraphs within the element with ID mainContent will have Arial as font, except for elements within paragraphs with class firstSentence \*/ \</pre> \<h2>The important keyword\</h2> \<p>There's one exception. You can boost the importance of a declaration by adding the magic words \<code>!important\</code> before the closing semicolon. This will tell CSS to ignore all those rules about specifics and inheritance, and just use this attribute.\</p>
\<pre data-lang="css"\> p { color:blue !important; } #mainContent p { color:red; } /\* Paragraphs will have a blue text colour \*/ \</pre>
\<p>I am, however, against using this. A good CSS structure should prevent using this, and has better performance, readability and scalability. If you find yourself adding this keyword to something, there's no turning back\-\--your style sheet will keep growing on important keywords, until it's all a big mess. If you find yourself eager to use it, try to think of a better way to structure your code to prevent it.\</p> " slug: "css3-priorities-inheritance-important" cat:

"\<p>The majority of CSS properties take \<strong>numbers\</strong> or
\<strong>colours\</strong> as values. A number by itself doesn't mean anything, which is why every number needs some \<strong>unit\</strong> after it. On the other hand, we can't describe a colour to a computer, which is why we need ways to input them. This chapter is about just that, and is the last one before we can finally begin discussing all the wonderful ways you can style things using CSS!\</p> \<h2>Units\</h2>
\<p>CSS has a bunch of predefined units you can use for your numbers. Those can be categorised as \<strong>absolute units\</strong> and
\<strong>relative units\</strong>. These units are added directly behind the number\-\--there's no white space between them (e.g., 100 pixels is denoted as \<code>100px\</code>).\</p> \<p>NOTE: When a property has value 0, you don't need to supply a unit. Zero is always zero.\</p>
\<p>NOTE 2: As you will see later on, some properties take multiple arguments, and therefore multiple numbers. You can use different units for the different numbers if you want.\</p> \<h2>Absolute Units\</h2>
\<p>This type of unit has a fixed length, and doesn't depend on the size or settings of the parent element or browser window an element is displayed in.\</p> \<table> \<tbody> \<tr> \<td> \<p>Unit\</p> \</td>

Fortunately, however, most high resolution screens make up for it by treating one CSS pixel as multiple pixels on their device. You shouldn't run into many problems, but it has become more common these days to use relative units for everything.\</p> \<h2>Relative Units\</h2> \<p>This type of unit scales with the size of other elements or the browser window. Because devices can have a lot of different screen sizes, it's recommended to make as much as possible of your design \<strong>responsive\</strong>. This simply means that the layout easily adapts to changes in viewport size ( = dimensions of the browser window viewing the page).\</p>

\</tr> \</tbody> \</table> \<h2>Colours\</h2> \<p>CSS has around 175 colour names automatically supported, such as \<em>red\</em>,
\<em>orange\</em> and \<em>pink\</em>. With a colour spectrum of over 16 million colours, however, that is a bit limiting. Therefore, other methods are used within CSS.\</p> \<h5>RGB\</h5>
\<p>\<strong>RGB\</strong> uses three channels as input:
\<strong>red\</strong>, \<strong>green\</strong> and
\<strong>blue\</strong>. Each of these can take a value between 0 and
255; 0 means the colour isn't present at all, and 255 means the colour is fully represented.\</p> \> For example: \<code>rgb(255,0,0)\</code>is pure red, \<code>rgb(0,0,255)\</code> pure blue,
\<code>rgb(122,122,122)\</code> is grey. \<p>\<strong>RGBA\</strong> works the same way, but takes an extra \<strong>alpha\</strong> parameter that specifies the opacity of the colour. It doesn't actually change the colour, but determines to what extent underlying colours in the design influence it. An alpha of 0 means the colour is fully transparent (not visible), and an alpha of 1 means you can't see through it.\</p> \<h5>HEX\</h5> \<p>\<strong>HEX\</strong> a different, shorter way of writing RGB colours. It uses a base-16 system. This simply means that we use the numbers 0\-\--9, and then say A = 10, B =
11, C = 12, D = 13, E = 14 and F = 15. This way, we can represent those numbers (between 0 and 255) with only two digits: 00 up to and including FF.\</p> \> For example: \<code>#FF0000\</code> is pure red,
\<code>#0000FF\</code> is pure blue, \<code>#7A7A7A\</code> is grey
\<p>\<strong>HEX shortcut\</strong> is an even shorter way to display colours. If a colour has repeating digits, we can write a hex code with only one digit per channel.\</p> \> For example:\<code> #F00\</code> is pure red, \<code>#00F\</code> is pure blue, \<code>#FFF\</code> is the whitest white. \<h5>HSL\</h5> \<p>\<strong>HSL\</strong> is an entirely different way of representing colours. It uses \<strong>hue\</strong>,
\<strong>saturation\</strong> and \<strong>luminosity\</strong> as arguments. These translate to \<em>colour, pureness \</em>and
\<em>brightness\</em>. Hue gets a value between 0 and 360 degrees, saturation and luminosity from 0 to 100%.\</p> \> For example:
\<code>hsl(0,100,50)\</code> is full red, \<code>hsl(240,100,50)\</code> pure blue, \<code>hsl(0,0,50)\</code> is grey.
\<p>\<strong>HSLA\</strong> works the same way, but takes an extra alpha parameter (just as RGBA).\</p> \<p>This might be much to take in now, but I assure you that you'll get the hang of it quickly once you start playing around with it.

Boxes with certain dimensions and position, with a border and some empty space.\</p> \<p>Whatever the shape of its children or parent elements, everything is a box. This may seem as if it restricts your options (what if you wanted a circular element?), but it actually enables you to create a vast array of different designs in an easy way. Rectangles are simple and intuitive geometry, especially for
\<em>rectangular\</em> browser windows, which means it isn't hard to find out what effect a certain CSS declaration will have.\</p> \<h2>A Very Important Image\</h2> \<p>\<img src="media/CSS3BoxModel.png"
/>\</p> \<p>Remember this image very well. It is a very simple overview of what lies at the core of CSS. Every box can be styled with these properties to be at any position, at any size. Using padding you can even position and scale the content that is inside, while the border provides a way to distinguish different elements on the page.\</p>
\<p>Whenever you create a new design for anything on your website, I think it is useful to always start with the box model. First look at those basic properties and see what you can get by only setting those, and only then look further to more advanced properties to achieve the exact look you want.\</p> \<p>For example, say you wanted to offset a certain element X, 100 pixels to the right. You could place an element before X in the HTML structure, and make that element a hundred pixels wide. But, the easier way would be to make the left margin of X one hundred pixels exactly.\</p> \<h2>Seriously, everything's a box\</h2>
\<p>Even the body element that is required for every HTML page. Most browsers automatically add some padding to this element to offset all content from the sides of the browser window\-\--much like there's always some white space around the borders when you print something on A4. Keep this in mind, and know that you could just select the body element with CSS to override those standard rules.\</p> " slug:

This means that if you type a really long sentence, the element would become wider than the screen and you would have to scroll to read it all. This also means that if you type something really short, you get a nice clean box around it with perfect dimensions. Webpages, however, are not made to extend in width but in height. We read from top to bottom, so it's only logical that you have to scroll down to read further on large webpages. Therefore, if you set or restrict the width of an element, text that reaches the end of the line will automatically continue on the next line below\-\--like we're used to. Nice!\</p>
\<h2>Setting width and height\</h2> \<p>As expected, we use the
\<code>width\</code> and \<code>height\</code> properties for this. These can take any number as value.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\>
.someBox { width:500px; height:100%; } \</pre> \<h2>Restricting width and height\</h2> \<p>If we want our webpage to be responsive, i.e. scale with different viewport sizes, a fixed size for each element isn't going to help us. It's therefore common practice to set the size of an element in percentages, and then restrict it to make sure it doesn't get too small or large.\</p> \<p>The \<code>max-width\</code> and
\<code>max-height\</code> properties set a maximum, while
\<code>min-width\</code> and \<code>min-height\</code> properties set the minimum.

\<h2>Padding\</h2> \<p>Padding refers to the white space between the content of a box and its border. There are four sides for which we can set this: left, top, right, bottom.\</p> \<p>To set a value for these individually, we use \<code>padding-left\</code>,
\<code>padding-top\</code>, \<code>padding-right\</code>, and
\<code>padding-bottom\</code> after each other.\</p> \<p>But, we can also take a shortcut. The \<code>padding\</code> property can take one to four arguments:\</p> \<table> \<tbody> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>Declaration\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Explanation\</p> \</td> \</tr>
\<tr> \<td> \<p>\<code>padding: \<em>a b c d\</em>;\</code>\</p> \</td>

/\* Content of the box has 20px white space all around it \*/ \</pre>
\<h2>Margin\</h2> \<p>Margin refers to the white space between the border of a box and the outside world ("the other boxes").\</p>
\<p>Again, we can set the same four sides with
\<code>margin-left\</code>, \<code>margin-top\</code>,
\<code>margin-right\</code>, and \<code>margin-bottom\</code>.\</p>
\<p>There's also the \<code>margin\</code> shortcut that can take one to four arguments in exactly the same way as padding. Margin and padding are practically the same concept, it's just that one is on the inside of the box, and the order at the outside.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\>
.someBox { margin:20px; } /\* The whole box has 20px white space all around it \*/ \</pre> \<h2>Box Sizing\</h2> \<p>Now, there's one small obstacle. When we set a width or height for an element, it does
\<strong>not\</strong> take into account the padding, border and margin. For example, if we set an element to a width of 100 pixels, and then add a padding of 10 pixels, the resulting element on screen will take up 110 pixels.\</p> \<p>If we want the browser to take padding and border into account, we need to set the \<code>box-sizing\</code> property.

\<code>border-box\</code>.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> .someBox { box-sizing:border-box; } \</pre> \<p>\<em>Why doesn't it take margin into account?\</em> Because margin isn't important for an element's size\-\--it's mainly for positioning purposes (to offset it or give it some breathing space).

When most people think about borders, especially on the web, they paint a picture of an ugly, grey, thin line around something. Yes, those are the default borders that come with some elements, but those are \<em>bad borders\</em>. In web design, borders are used very often to subtly make a distinction between different groups or content. The other option you have with borders is to go big or go home\-\--for example, this website uses a huge border to the left of every article to separate content and navigation, and that border forms a significant part of the overall design.\</p> \<p>Every element can have a border around it, at all four sides. These can be as large as you want to be, take on certain styles (solid or dots for example), and use colours or images to fill them in. If you find the corners too sharp, you can make them round. As you can see, somehow, a lot of attention was paid to borders when CSS was created.\</p> \<h2>The Syntax\</h2> \<p>First, we'll focus on the syntax for giving one side of an element a border. As expected, the properties for these are
\<code>border-left\</code>, \<code>border-top\</code>,
\<code>border-right\</code>, and \<code>border-bottom\</code>. It needs three arguments, which are \<strong>width, style\</strong> and
\<strong>colour\</strong>, respectively.\</p> \<ul> \<li>The width determines the size of the border, and takes any \<em>positive\</em> number.\</li> \<li>The style \<strong>must\</strong> be set to something, or the border won't display. The list of border styles can be found at the end of this chapter.\</li> \<li>The colour speaks for itself\-\--it can use any valid CSS colour code.\</li> \</ul> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p { border-bottom:1px solid green; border-left:3px solid black; border-right:8px dotted red; border-top:2px solid purple; }
\</pre> \<p>If you want to alter one of those three arguments individually, you can do that as well! Simply add \<code>-width\</code>,
\<code>-style\</code> or \<code>-color\</code> to the end.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p { border-left-width:1px; border-left-style:solid; border-left-color:green; } \</pre> \<h2>The Shortcut Syntax\</h2>
\<p>Luckily, the syntax for setting multiple borders in one declaration is the same as we've seen with padding and margin, and uses the
\<code>border\</code> property. The only difference here is that every value is actually three values.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p { border:1px solid green; } p { border-bottom:1px solid green; border-left:1px solid green; border-right:1px solid green; border-top:1px solid green; } /\* These two styles are identical \*/
\</pre> \<p>But, because of that multitude of arguments, you can also set one of them for multiple borders at the same time, using the
\<code>border-width\</code>, \<code>border-style\</code> and
\<code>border-color\</code> properties.\</p> \<h2>Round Borders\</h2>
\<p>With round borders, I mean the roundness of the corners. If you set it to some high value, the box will look like an ellipse or circle\-\--but it's still a box.\</p> \<p>You can create them by setting the \<code>border-radius\</code> property. By default, a border has a sharp edge and therefore border radius 0.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p { border-radius:50%; } \</pre> \<h2>Outlines\</h2>
\<p>Sometimes, we need more than one border. To be able to do so, we can essentially fill some of the element's margin, creating a border around the border. We can only do this once though: if you want a massive amount of borders, just create multiple nested elements. This is done with the \<code>outline\</code> property, which accepts the same arguments.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p { outline:5px solid green; }
\</pre> \<p>The outline is in the margin, so it doesn't add to the element's width or height.\</p> \<h2>Image Borders\</h2> \<p>Using an image as a border is a tricky business. It allows you to create all sorts of fancy borders you couldn't possibly get with the normal syntax, but it takes some preparation. The property to use is
\<code>border-image\</code>.\</p> \<p>First of all, the border-image won't work if you don't set a border width, so don't forget that. The reason for this is that the image scales with the border width, so the default width of 0px leaves you with no image.\</p> \<p>It takes three arguments: an \<strong>image\</strong>, how to \<strong>slice\</strong> the image, and how to \<strong>apply\</strong> the image.\</p> \<p>The image is provided by URL, which means
\<code>\<attr>url(\</attr>'pathtofile.jpg'\<attr>)\</attr>\</code>. CSS can handle pretty much any file type, but \<em>jpg\</em>,
\<em>png\</em> and \<em>gif\</em> are favourites.\</p> \<p>\<img src="media/CSS3BorderImage.png" />\</p> \<p>Slicing the image is done by defining what part of the image is border, and what is not. It works the same way as the normal shortcut syntax for border width, and works from the outside to the inside. See the image for clarification\-\--I can't really explain this in words.\</p> \<p>There are three options for how to apply the image:\</p> \<ul> \<li>\<code>repeat\</code>: repeats the image along the borders\</li> \<li>\<code>stretch\</code>: stretches the image to create the borders\</li>
\<li>\<code>round\</code>: repeats, and then stretches if it doesn't fit perfectly.\</li> \</ul> \<p>It's most common to set one value for all borders, but you can set them individually as well if you like.\</p>
\<pre data-lang="css"\> p { border-image: url(aFile.jpg) 10% repeat; }
\</pre> \<h2>List of Border Styles\</h2> \<table> \<tbody> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>Value\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Description\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr>

"\[CSS3\] Display" post: "\<p>Until now, we've viewed everything as a strong and independent box with lots of space around it. But that's not how most elements behave. Websites often have a few big containers
(such as header, footer, sidebar, content), and the rest of the elements is displayed in a different way.\</p> \<p>In the HTML5 tutorial, we made a distinction between \<strong>block\</strong> and
\<strong>inline\</strong> elements when we talked about
\<code>\<div>\</code> and \<code>\<span>\</code>, and this is the part where CSS continues on the subject. Arguably, it's the most important property there is, because CSS is all about displaying stuff. Not surprisingly, the property to use is \<code>display\</code>.\</p> \<p>A
\<code>block\</code>-level element has a fixed size, regardless of the content. It doesn't allow other elements next to it, and pushes those below itself. A block-level element is useful, because it is clean and consistent in behaviour, but it's hard to work with them once you get to the details of a design.\</p> \<p>That's when \<code>inline\</code> elements come into play. Inline elements \<em>can't\</em> have their width and height set\-\--those are determined by their content and surroundings. Their placement is also determined by what's around it, as they will try to be \<em>in line\</em> with the text or other elements.\</p> \<p>While those two cover most cases, there will be times when you want a block element next to other elements instead of in its own space, and there's a compromise for that:
\<code>inline-block\</code>.\</p> \<img src="media/CSS3DisplayProperty.png" /> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { display:block; } span { display:inline; } .specialElements { display:inline-block; } \</pre> \<p>NOTE: Setting the property to

It doesn't remove it from the page.\</p> \<h2>Tables\</h2> \<p>In the HTML5 tutorial, I kept telling you to keep mark up and layout separate. To make this easier, CSS has a way of simulating a tabular layout, without actually using \<code>\<table>\</code> tags.

\<code>position\</code> attribute comes in handy. There's four values it can take on, and they are all very important. Once you have set the type of positioning you want, you can use the \<code>left\</code>,
\<code>top\</code>, \<code>right\</code> and \<code>bottom\</code> properties to specify the offset at each side.\</p> \<h2>Static\</h2>
\<p>The default positioning. Nothing special is done, and the element is not affected by the positional properties (left, top, right and bottom). If you want something to be positioned the regular way\-\--which is often the case\-\--you don't have to set this; you can just omit the position property.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p { position:static; }
\</pre> \<h2>Relative\</h2> \<p>The element is positioned relative to its original, normal position. This means that it leaves a gap of white space at the place it originally was, one that is not filled by other elements.

\<pre data-lang="css"\> p span { position:relative; } \</pre>
\<h2>Absolute\</h2> \<p>An absolutely positioned element solves the gap problem. Its dimensions are completely removed from the page, and the element can be placed anywhere. The positional properties determine the offset from the \<em>nearest positioned ancestor\</em>. This simply means that it looks at the parent elements, and checks if they have their position set to anything else than static. If that is not the case, the element is positioned with respect to the document body, and moves along with page scrolling\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> span.absolutePos { position:absolute; } \</pre> \<p>It's often used for pinning an element to the bottom or top of its parent container, in which case you shouldn't forget to also give that parent element a positional value.\</p> \<h2>Fixed\</h2> \<p>A fixed element is always positioned relatively to the viewport ( = browser window), which means that it always keeps the same position, even when the user scrolls.

\<h2>Overlapping Elements\</h2> \<p>With fancy new positions comes responsibility. Elements can start to overlap and get in the way, and you need to decide which one is displayed on top. This is done with the

"\[CSS3\] Alignment" post: "\<p>We all know about text alignment, but in CSS there are ways to transfer this concept to whole elements. Sometimes you don't want to pin an element's position as precisely as in the previous chapter, and that's when you use alignment.\</p>
\<h2>Float and Clear\</h2> \<p>The \<code>float\</code> property was originally intended to wrap text around images, but it has a lot of uses. It tells CSS that an element should be taken out of the normal flow, and pinned against the \<code>left\</code> or \<code>right\</code> edge.\</p> \<p>\<em>What's the difference with absolute positioning?\</em> The element is still taken into account, and elements around it will work with it nicely, instead of overlapping or
'colliding'.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> img { float:left; } /\* Aligns images to the left and makes text naturally flow around it \*/
\</pre> \<p>There are, however, moments when you don't want elements to push themselves against a floating element. You can use the
\<code>clear\</code> property to specify on which side of an element you don't allow floating elements. The values it can take are
\<code>left\</code>, \<code>right\</code> and \<code>both\</code>.\</p>
\<pre data-lang="css"\> p { clear:both; } /\* Paragraphs are not allowed to have any elements floating beside it \*/ \</pre>
\<h2>Vertical-align\</h2> \<p>Vertical align is very useful, but not the hero you want it to be. Your first thought would be that you can align any element to the top, bottom or centre\-\--but that's not true. The reason for this is that webpages were designed to extend towards the bottom, and vertically aligning something would therefore often mean that it is placed miles away from where it originally was, which creates problems for the text around it. Therefore, the property
\<code>vertical-align\</code> only works in contained environments: tables and inline-block elements.\</p> \<p>Tables, by default, align the cell contents to the middle of the cell. Most of the time, though, you want it to align contents to the top, and then you can use this property. It also works on elements that have their display property set to \<code>table-cell\</code>.\</p> \<p>Inline-block elements, by default, are aligned to the baseline. This means that it finds that imaginary line that typed text always sits on, and aligns that with the baseline of the text around it. But, sometimes you don't want that, and then you can change it with this property as well.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p span { vertical-align:top; display:inline-block; }

\<strong>typography\</strong>. If you don't define any properties for your text, it will still display fine, but probably not look very well.\</p> \<p>The default settings are a \<em>black\</em> colour,
\<em>Times New Roman\</em> font, and no special other settings (like, for example, white space between letters). Now, I don't know about you, but that looks awful in almost any web design. Thankfully, CSS has a lot of typographic properties you can and should use to your advantage.\</p>
\<p>(I have a \<strong>\<em>typography course\</em>\</strong> for anybody interested in the details!)\</p> \<h2>Color\</h2> \<p>To set the text colour, we use the \<code>color\</code> property. It can take any valid CSS colour code as its value.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p { color:rgb(100,150,250); } \</pre> \<h2>Text Alignment\</h2> \<p>The
\<code>text-align\</code> property handles this, and can take the four values \<code>left\</code>, \<code>center\</code>, \<code>right\</code> and \<code>justified\</code>.\</p> \<p>\<em>What is justified?\</em> Justified means that the browser stretches a line of text, by adding extra spacing between words, to fit the width exactly. The left and right margins are straight, which is often perceived as cleaner, but be careful that not too much uneven spacing is added between words.\</p>
\<pre data-lang="css"\> h1 { text-align:center; width:100%; } \</pre>
\<h2>Spacing\</h2> \<p>Use \<code>letter-spacing\</code> to increase white space between letters, and \<code>word-spacing\</code> to increase white space between words. They both take any number (even negative ones) as value.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p { letter-spacing:2px; word-spacing:10px; } \</pre> \<h2>Line Height\</h2> \<p>The
\<code>line-height\</code> property specifies white space between
\<em>lines of text\</em>. The default value of 100% is often too low for web design. Again, can use any number!\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p
{ line-height:145%; } \</pre> \<h2>Transformation\</h2> \<p>The
\<code>text-transform\</code> property can transform a piece of text to a different case: \<code>lowercase\</code>, \<code>uppercase\</code> or
\<code>capitalize\</code>. The first two do what you expect, which is turn all letters to lowercase or uppercase. Capitalize means that it makes the first letter of every word a capital letter.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> h1 { text-transform:uppercase; } \</pre>
\<h2>Decoration\</h2> \<p>The \<code>text-decoration\</code> property is used to \<code>underline\</code> (like with links),
\<code>overline\</code> or \<code>line-through\</code> (like the \<del> tag) elements. Setting it to \<code>none\</code> removes it.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> a { text-decoration:none; } \</pre> \<p>NOTE: Underlined elements are often assumed to be links, which is why I suggest leaving the text-decoration for the links. If you desperately want a line above or below something, try a \<em>border\</em>.\</p>
\<h2>Indentation\</h2> \<p>There are two ways to create a distinction between paragraphs: some vertical white space between them, or indenting the first line. Never both. The \<code>text-indent\</code> basically represents a margin only for the first line of text in an element, and can take any number as value.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p { text-indent:36.0pt; } \</pre> \<h2>Wrapping\</h2> \<p>The default behaviour is to start a new line when the text content becomes wider than the element, and the browser breaks off the current line at a white space or hyphen.\</p> \<p>Sometimes though, you'll have words that are just too long, and if you only started newlines at whitespace characters the text would look very odd. The \<code>word-wrap\</code> property can prevent this. The default value is \<code>normal\</code>, but you can set it to \<code>break-word\</code> if you want to allow browsers to cut long words in half.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p { word-wrap:break-word; } \</pre> \<p>You can even take it one step further, and let the browser break all words at any point they need. For this, the \<code>word-break\</code> property was invented. The default value is \<code>keep-all\</code>, but setting it to
\<code>break-all\</code> tells browsers they can split words at any point. I don't recommend using it.\</p> \<p>And lastly, if you have set the overflow property to hidden on a certain element, it's useful to tell the user that some part has been cut off. You can do this with the
\<code>text-overflow\</code> property. The default value is
\<code>clip\</code> (just hide the overflow), but
\<code>ellipsis\</code> adds an ellipsis ( &hellip; ) at the end.\</p>
\<pre data-lang="css"\> p span { text-overflow:ellipsis; } \</pre>
\<h2>White Space\</h2> \<p>One of the main concepts of HTML is that it removes all white space and line breaks typed in the code, and replaces them with a single space between characters. The only exception is the
\<strong>\<pre>\</strong> element, but that has a semantic value (and some extra default styles), so you don't want to use that for everything. Therefore, to simulate some of its good attributes, the
\<code>white-space\</code> property has been created. It controls how white space inside an element is used.\</p> \<img src="media/CSS3WhiteSpace.png" /> \<p>The default setting is
\<code>normal\</code>, which means it collapses sequences of whitespace into a single one and wraps text automatically when necessary (as discussed in the previous section on wrapping). The other values are:\</p> \<table> \<tbody> \<tr> \<td> \<p>Value\</p> \</td> \<td>
\<p>Description\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>nowrap\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Sequences of white space will collapse. Text will never wrap automatically\-\--it will continue on the same line until it encounters a \<br/> tag\</p> \</td> \</tr>
\<tr> \<td> \<p>\<code>pre\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>All whitespace is preserved by the browser. Text will only wrap on line breaks\</p>
\</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td> \<p>\<code>pre-line\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td>
\<p>Sequences of white space will collapse, but line breaks are preserved and text will also wrap when necessary.\</p> \</td> \</tr>

"\[CSS3\] Fonts" post: "\<p>Now it is time to get rid of that default font, and add some variation.\</p> \<h2>Font Families\</h2> \<p>To set the font for a certain element, use the \<code>font-family\</code> property.\</p> \<p>\<em>Why the "family"?\</em> Because most fonts have light, bold, italic, and other variations that all belong to the same family. This way, you can set a font family for an element, and then use other properties to access the different styles within that family.\</p> \<p>The value is the name of the font. You can use pre-installed fonts that come with every system (like Arial or Helvetica), or you can add your own fonts. That is discussed at the end of this chapter.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> body { font-family:
'Open Sans'; } \</pre> \<p>If you want, you can specify multiple values, separated by commas. If a certain font isn't available or failed to load properly, the browser will check with the next one, until it finds a font it can use. It's a sort of backup plan.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> body { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman; } \</pre> \<h2>Font Size\</h2> \<p>The \<code>font-size\</code> property can be used for that. It can take any \<em>positive\</em> number as value.\</p> \<p>The default font size is 16px, and it's recommended to keep font sizes on the web larger than in print. The actual size partially depends on the font\-\--some fonts are naturally larger or smaller.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> body { font-size:
20px; } \</pre> \<h2>Style and Weight\</h2> \<p>The
\<code>font-style\</code> property is used to create \<em>italics\</em>. It has three values: \<code>normal\</code>, \<code>italic\</code> and
\<code>oblique\</code>. The last two both display a slanted version of the font, but italic tries to use the italic variation of a font family, while oblique simply puts every letter at an angle. It's therefore recommended to use the italic value whenever possible.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p span { font-style:italic; } \</pre> \<p>The other style a font can have, light or bold, is set with the
\<code>font-weight\</code> property. The most common values are
\<code>normal\</code> and \<code>bold\</code>, and can be used with any font\</p> \<p>However, it also accepts the numbers \<em>100, 200, 300,
400, 500, 600, 700, 800\</em> and \<em>900\</em>. Here, 100 is a very thin variation and 900 an extremely thick one. These values only have effect if the specified font-family has their own font file for these. For example, every computer has the font-family Calibri, which contains a file called Calibri Light.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> p .highlight
{ font-weight: bold; } \</pre> \<p>Similarly, the
\<code>font-stretch\</code> property defines how much the letters are stretched, but can only be used if the font-family has support for it. The possible values are: \<em>ultra-condensed, extra-condensed, semi-condensed, condensed, normal, expanded, semi-expanded, extra-expanded \</em>and \<em>ultra-expanded\</em>.\</p>
\<h2>Variation\</h2> \<p>The \<code>font-variant\</code> property is a very specific one. It only accepts two values: \<code>normal\</code> and
\<code>small-caps\</code>. Small-caps are basically uppercase letters, but made smaller so that they are the same size as the lowercase ones.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> a { font-variant:small-caps; }
\</pre> \<h2>Adding Custom Fonts\</h2> \<p>To add our own custom fonts, we use a special type of selector: \<code>\@font-face\</code>. Within, we need to specify at least two things:\</p> \<ul> \<li>The
\<code>font-family\</code> property with the name we want to give the font as value.\</li> \<li>The \<code>src\</code> property with the URL to the font file as value.\</li> \</ul> \<p>If you want to add variations, like condensed or italic, you need to specify those as well.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> \@font-face { font-family: AwesomeName; src: url(FontFile.otf); } \</pre> \<p>All browsers support the TTF, OTF and WOFF formats, and loading of fonts is usually quite quick. Just to be sure, however, make sure your font files are not too large.\</p> \<p>NOTE: The \@font-face selector only applies to one font. If you want to add multiple custom fonts, you need to close the selector and start a new selector for the next one.\</p> " slug: "css3-fonts" cat: "Website" subcat: "CSS3" video: "" diff: 2 quiz: "1?Change the letter size?Use the \<code>font-size\</code> property@ 1?Make text italic?Use the \<code>font-style\</code> property@ 1?Make text bold or thin?Use the \<code>font-weight\</code> property@ 1?Set a font for an element?Use the \<code>font-family\</code> property@ 1?Add your own custom fonts?Use the \<code>&commat;font-face\</code> selector, and supply name and font file" - id: 206 title: "\[CSS3\] Backgrounds & Images" post: "\<p>The one major thing we haven't discussed yet, is the background. Every element can have a background, and it often adds a lot to your design if you play with it.\</p> \<h2>Background Colour\</h2> \<p>You can set the complete background to a single colour using the \<code>background-color\</code> property, which takes any valid CSS colour code as value.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> body { background-color:rgb(200,100,50); } \</pre> \<p>One flat colour, however, isn't always interesting. Sometimes you want some more variation, and that's when \<strong>images\</strong> and
\<strong>gradients\</strong> come in. I'll now discuss images\-\--gradients are less important and saved for a later chapter.\</p> \<h2>Background Images\</h2> \<p>By default, setting a background image will pin the image to the top left corner. It will include it in its full size, and repeat along the width and height if necessary. But, that's not always what you want\-\--it's almost never what you want, actually\-\--which means there's a lot of properties for background images to get them looking great.\</p> \<p>The
\<code>background-image\</code> property sets the image, and takes a URL as value.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> .coolIcon { background-image:url(coolImage.jpg); } \</pre> \<h2>Background Repeat\</h2> \<p>To control the repeating you can use the
\<code>background-repeat\</code> property, which has the values:\</p>
\<ul> \<li>\<code>repeat\</code> (repeat the image in both x and y direction)\</li> \<li>\<code>repeat-x\</code> (repeat the image in the x direction = horizontally)\</li> \<li>\<code>repeat-y\</code> (repeat the image in the y direction = vertically)\</li>
\<li>\<code>no-repeat\</code> (if you don't want it to repeat)\</li>
\</ul> \<pre data-lang="css"\> body { background-image:url(seamlessTexture.jpg); background-repeat:repeat; }
\</pre> \<h2>Background Position\</h2> \<p>To reposition it, use the
\<code>background-position\</code> property. You can supply two numbers, which are the offset in the x and y direction, respectively. Some predefined values, though, are available and are often just wat you need:\</p> \> \<em>left top, left center, left bottom, right top, right center, right bottom, center top, center center \</em>and \<em>center bottom\</em>. \<p>If you specify only one keyword, the other one will automatically be \<em>center\</em>.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\>
.coolIcon { background-position: center; /\* background-position: center center; would be the same \*/ } \</pre> \<h2>Background Attachment\</h2>
\<p>The \<code>background-attachment\</code> property specifies what part of an element the background is attached to, which in turn decides what happens when the user scrolls. The default value is
\<code>scroll\</code>, which means the background scrolls along with the element it belongs to; it is fixed to its position within the element. Other possible values are:\</p> \> \<code>fixed\</code>: the background is fixed to the viewport, and scrolls when the viewport scrolls, regardless of the element's position or scroll. \>
\<code>local\</code>: the background scrolls along with the element's contents, like it would do if it was an image inside the element. \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { background-attachment: local; } \</pre>
\<h2>Background Size\</h2> \<p>Use the \<code>background-size\</code> property. You can specify exact dimensions using two numbers (width and height), but there's also two predefined values that can be useful:\</p> \> \<code>contain\</code>: scales it to fit to the smallest dimension. This means that the background image will never overflow the element and fit perfectly at one side, but there might be a gap because it's too small. \> \<code>cover\</code>: scales it to fit to the largest dimension. This means that the background image will nicely fill the whole element, but it will overflow at the smaller side. \<p>To some extent, overflow and fitting problems can be fixed by making your image the correct aspect ratio.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> .coolIcon { background-size:contain; } body { background-size:50% 50%; } \</pre>
\<h2>Background Clip\</h2> \<p>The \<code>background-clip\</code> property tells us how far to extend the background. More specifically, it determines whether the background also covers the border or padding area of a box. It has, therefore, 3 possible values:\</p> \<ul>
\<li>\<code>border-box\</code>: the default value. The background extends to the borders, and will therefore be visible underneath semi-transparent borders.\</li> \<li>\<code>padding-box\</code>: the background doesn't cover the borders, but does extend through padding space.\</li> \<li>\<code>content-box\</code>: the background only covers the actual content\-\--padding is left as white space.\</li> \</ul>
\<pre data-lang="css"\> div { background-clip:content-box; } \</pre>
\<h2>Background Origin\</h2> \<p>The \<code>background-origin\</code> property works the same way as \<code>background-clip\</code>, but with a small difference. A background clip determines what part of the background is shown, while the background origin determines where that background image is positioned. Essentially, it determines from where the \<code>background-position\</code> property starts to offset the image. It takes the same 3 values as
\<code>background-clip\</code>.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { background-origin: border-box; } \</pre> \<p>NOTE:
\<code>background-origin\</code> and \<code>background-clip\</code> also work for regular background \<em>colours\</em>!\</p> \<h2>Opacity\</h2>
\<p>We've already seen how to make semi-transparent colours, but we can also set how transparent a \<em>complete element\</em> is\-\--including borders, background, and all content. For this we use the
\<code>opacity\</code> property, which takes a number between 0 and 1; 0 means it's fully transparent (invisible), 1 means it's fully opaque
(the default setting, you don't see what's underneath it).\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> img { opacity:0.5; } \</pre> \<h2>Multiple Background Images\</h2> \<p>You can specify as many background images as you like, using a comma to separate them.\</p> \<p>All the other properties can also accept as many values as you like, separated by comma.\</p> \<p>As you'd expect, these are linked by order\-\--the first value corresponds to the first URL specified, second to the second, etcetera.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> .superCoolIcon { background-image: url(image1.jpg), url(image2.jpg), url(image3.jpg); background-position: left top, center, right bottom; } \</pre> " slug:

"\[CSS3\] Lists, Tables & Links" post: "\<p>Up until now I've discussed with you all the fundamental properties of CSS, and to close off this portion of the course I'll discuss a few properties aimed specifically at a certain group of elements. This doesn't mean that everything past this chapter isn't important anymore\-\--this simply means that the advanced stuff is coming.\</p> \<h2>Input\</h2> \<p>The
\<code>resize\</code> property can be used to specify if an element can be resized. Though this property is available for every element, its most common use is to allow the user to resize input elements that are too small or large.\</p> \<p>The values it can take are
\<code>horizontal\</code> (you can adjust the width),
\<code>vertical\</code> (you can adjust the height) or
\<code>both\</code>. The default value is \<code>none\</code>, which means it can't be resized.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> input\[type="text"\] { resize:both; } \</pre> \<h2>Lists\</h2> \<p>By default, for HTML lists, browsers use bullets for unordered lists and numbers for ordered ones. We can change this!\</p> \<p>The
\<code>list-style-type\</code> property takes care of this. It can have these values:\</p> \<table> \<tbody> \<tr> \<td> \<p>Value\</p> \</td>
\<td> \<p>Description\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>disc\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>The default value\</p>
\</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td> \<p>\<code>none\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td>
\<p>Nothing in front of it\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>circle\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>The marker is a circle\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td> \<p>\<code>square\</code>\</p>
\</td> \<td> \<p>The marker is a square\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>decimal\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>The marker is a number\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>decimal-leading-zero\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>The marker is a number with leading zeros (01, 02, &hellip; )\</p> \</td> \</tr>
\<tr> \<td> \<p>\<code>lower-alpha\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td>
\<p>Lowercase letters: a, b, c, d, &hellip;\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr>
\<td> \<p>\<code>lower-latin\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Same as lower-alpha.\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>lower-greek\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Lowercase Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>lower-roman\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Lowercase Roman numbers: i, ii, iii, iv, &hellip;\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>

\<p>\<code>upper-roman\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Uppercase Roman numbers: I, II, III, IV, &hellip;\</p> \</td> \</tr> \</tbody> \</table>
\<p>But, if you want something really special, you can use
\<code>list-style-image\</code> with a URL to an image.\</p> \<p>And, last but not least, using the \<code>list-style-position\</code> property, we can decide if we want this marker \<code>inside\</code> or
\<code>outside\</code> the \<li> tag.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> ul
{ list-style-type: upper-roman; list-style-position: outside; } \</pre>
\<h2>Tables\</h2> \<p>The \<code>border-collapse\</code> property determines whether two borders of adjacent cells should be merged. The default value is \<code>separate\</code>, in which case borders are kept detached, which results in the standard so-called double border. The other value is \<code>collapse\</code>, in which case they are merged.\</p> \<p>The \<code>border-spacing\</code> property determines the distance ("margin") between two adjacent cells, and can take any number as value. If you give it two values, the first one sets
\<em>horizontal\</em> spacing, and the second one \<em>vertical\</em> spacing.\</p> \<p>The \<code>empty-cells\</code> property determines whether or not empty cells should be shown. The default value is
\<code>show\</code>. The other value is \<code>hide\</code>, in which case no background or borders are shown for empty cells.\</p> \<p>NOTE: If you set border-collapse to \<em>collapse\</em>, cells are merged and empty cells removed, which means the \<em>border-spacing\</em> and
\<em>empty-cells\</em> properties have no influence anymore.\</p>
\<p>The \<code>caption-side\</code> property determines where to display a table's caption (because the \<caption> element always needs to follow the \<table> element directly, you can't easily put it somewhere else another way). The default is \<code>top\</code>, the other value is
\<code>bottom\</code>\-\--which means the caption is put below the table.\</p> \<p>And finally, the \<code>table-layout\</code> property determines the algorithm used for displaying the table. The default value is \<code>auto\</code>, in which case column width is determined after the whole table has loaded, and adapts to the contents. The other value is \<code>fixed\</code>, which means the table follows width restrictions that you set, and can process the table faster.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> table { border-collapse:separate; border-spacing:20px; empty-cells:hide; } \</pre> \<h2>Links\</h2>
\<p>Have you ever noticed your cursor changing when hovering over a link? Well, for a lot of people, that is the cue that something is clickable or interactive. Therefore, it's possible in CSS to change the cursor for elements that are not links, but supposed to be clickable. It can be used for any element, but to signal a (sort of) link is by far the most common use. We use the \<code>cursor\</code> property for this, and it has the most amount of (textual) values of any property. Don't go wild with it though\-\--only use it when it provides a better user experience.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> .clickableThing { cursor:pointer; } \</pre> \<table> \<tbody> \<tr> \<td> \<p>Value\</p>

A gradient is a collection of background colours placed in a certain pattern. Usually, it is used to create a nice transition between multiple colours, but you can do quite a lot of things with it. Two types exist:
\<strong>linear\</strong> and \<strong>radial\</strong> gradients. Gradients are created with the \<code>background-image\</code> property, which means this chapter is all about the different values for that property.\</p> \<p>NOTE: Because of that, if a browser doesn't support a certain gradient, it will fall back on the
\<code>background-color\</code> property, so make sure you specify that as well.\</p> \<h2>Linear Gradients\</h2> \<p>Linear gradients start at one edge of the element, and move to the opposite side. This sounds as if they can only be horizontal or vertical, but they can be angled any way you like.\</p> \<img src="media/CSS3LinearGradients.png" />
\<p>The syntax is\</p> \<p>\<code class="longsyntax"\>linear-gradient(\<em>direction, colour stops\</em>)\</code>\</p> \<h2>Direction\</h2> \<p>The direction specifies the angle of the gradient. You can:\</p> \<ul> \<li>Set it in degrees, by using a number with the unit \<code>deg\</code>.\</li>
\<li>Point it towards a specific side of the element, using the word
\<code>to\</code> and one of the following directions: \<em>top left, top center, top right, center left, center right, bottom left, bottom center\</em> and \<em>bottom right\</em>\</li> \</ul> \<p>These direction words have appeared before with background properties, but the difference this time is that you can't point a gradient towards the centre of an element, because the gradient wouldn't know what to do beyond that point (at the other half of the element).\</p> \<h2>Colour Stops\</h2> \<p>A colour stop is a certain point within the gradient where the colour is changed. You can specify as many as you like, in a comma-separated list, but you must specify at least one. In that case, the gradient is just a solid colour.\</p> \<p>A colour stop requires two arguments: \<code>colour\</code> and \<code>position\</code>. The colour can be any valid CSS colour code, the position is a percentage. A gradient is always created from 0% to 100%, where 100% is the spot you pointed the gradient towards, and 0% the opposite end (\<em>starting point\</em>). If no position is set, all colour stops are distributed equally.\</p> \<p>NOTE: If you set two colour stops with the same position, the colours don't gradually fade into each other, but immediately change into each other. This can be what you want, sometimes.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> body { background-image: linear-gradient(90deg, red 0%, blue 50%, yellow 100%); } div { background-image: linear-gradient(to left center, red 0%, blue 50%, yellow 50%, red 100%); } \</pre> \<h2>Radial Gradients\</h2> \<p>Radial gradients start at one point within the element, and move outwards in all directions, like a circle. Because they don't have one direction, the first parameter instead specifies where the gradient starts and how far it extends.\</p> \<img src="media/CSS3RadialGradients.png" />
\<p>The syntax is\</p> \<p>\<code class="longsyntax"\>radial-gradient(\<em>settings, colour stops\</em>)\</code>\</p> \<h2>Radial Settings\</h2> \<p>By default, if you don't set this argument, the gradient starts at the \<em>center center\</em> of the element, and extends all the way to the edges. This means that it becomes an ellipse if the element is not a perfect square.\</p> \<p>This \<em>shape\</em> is the first thing we can change. By default, the first argument is \<code>ellipse\</code>, but you can force it into circular shape with \<code>circle\</code>.\</p> \<p>To control the \<em>size\</em>, we can use a second argument, which has these values:\</p> \<ul> \<li>\<code>closest-corner\</code>: scales it until it reaches the closest corner\</li>
\<li>\<code>closest-side\</code>: scales it until it reaches the closest edge\</li> \<li>\<code>farthest-corner\</code>: scales it until it reaches the farthest corner\</li> \<li>\<code>farthest-side\</code>: scales it until it reaches the farthest side\</li> \</ul> \<p>For example, if we want the gradient to be completely within the element, we'd use the value \<em>closest-side\</em>.\</p> \<p>And lastly, to control the \<em>starting point\</em>, we use a third argument which takes the same values as the \<strong>direction\</strong> with the linear gradient (so, \<code>at \<position>\</code>).\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> body { background-image: radial-gradient(circle closest-corner at left center, red 0%, blue 50%, yellow 100%); } \</pre>

"\<p>CSS supports a whole array of 2D and 3D transformations. This means that you can easily move, rotate, skew or scale an element in 2D or 3D space. It's all done with the \<code>transform\</code> property, which means that you can supply a lot of different values to it. But, before we start, there's one other important property to learn about.\</p> \<p>NOTE: Transform only changes the appearance of an element. Elements surrounding it will not see the difference, and will not adapt to a transformed element. For example, if you rotate an image, the text around it will still flow around it as if it were a regular rectangle.\</p> \<h2>Transform Origin\</h2> \<p>The
\<code>transform-origin\</code> property determines the origin for all transforms you're going to apply to the element. The 2D version takes two numbers, \<strong>x-position\</strong> and
\<strong>y-position\</strong>, as arguments. The default is \<code>50%
50%\</code>, which is the centre of the element, and is often what you want. But you can set it to, for example, \<code>0 0\</code> if you want to rotate something along the top left corner.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { transform-origin:50% 50%; } \</pre> \<p>A third value \<em>can\</em> be added for the
\<strong>z-position\</strong> of the origin.\</p> \<h2>2D Transforms\</h2> \<p>When we speak of transforms, we always speak of the magic trio: translate, rotate and scale. You can change an element's position, rotation and size without changing the element itself. There is, however, a special addition with 2D transforms: skew (or shear). This does change an element's structure, as it only changes one half of the element, but is still seen as part of the transform family, because of its general usefulness.\</p> \<img src="media/CSS3Transforms2D.png"
/> \<p>To apply multiple transforms, you need to separate them by a single \<strong>white-space\</strong>. You can apply as many as you like! Do keep in mind that the order in which you apply them matters.\</p> \<h5>Translate\</h5> \<p>Use
\<code>\<attr>translate(\</attr>\<em>x,y\</em>\<attr>)\</attr>\</code> to move an element in both directions at once, or
\<code>translateX(\<em>value\</em>)\</code> and
\<code>translateY(\<em>value\</em>)\</code> to change them separately. The values can be any number.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { transform:translate(50px,-50px); } \</pre> \<h5>Rotate\</h5> \<p>Use
\<code>\<attr>rotate(\</attr>\<em>angle\</em>\<attr>)\</attr>\</code>, where the angle can be any number with the unit \<code>deg\</code>
(degrees).\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { transform: rotate(45deg); } \</pre> \<h5>Scale\</h5> \<p>Use
\<code>\<attr>scale(\</attr>\<em>x-factor, y-factor\</em>\<attr>)\</attr>\</code>, where the factor is a number
\<em>without unit\</em>, and 1 is the default scale.\</p> \<p>You can use \<code>scaleX(\<em>factor\</em>)\</code> and
\<code>scaleY(\<em>factor\</em>)\</code> to apply the transform to separate dimensions.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { transform: scale(1.2,1.6); } \</pre> \<h5>Skew\</h5> \<p>Use

\<code>skewY(\<em>angle\</em>)\</code>.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { transform: skew(45deg,-45deg); } \</pre> \<h2>3D Transforms\</h2>
\<p>The most notable change is the fact that, in 3D space, there's a lot more interesting rotations possible. Instead of only a horizontal
(x) and vertical (y) axis, we can also use the
\<strong>z-axis\</strong>, which is the imaginary line coming straight out of the screen.\</p> \<img src="media/CSS3Transforms3D.png" />
\<p>For the other properties\-\--except skew\-\--there are equivalents for the z-axis:\</p> \<ul> \<li>The
\<code>translateZ(\<em>value\</em>)\</code> and
\<code>scaleZ(\<em>value\</em>)\</code> values to move or scale in the Z-direction\</li> \<li>The shorthand \<code>translate3d(\<em>x, y, z\</em>)\</code> and \<code>scale3d(\<em>x, y, z\</em>)\</code> to set all the values at once.\</li> \</ul> \<p>But, I don't see much use for transfering these concepts to 3D, so let's continue with the rotation part!\</p> \<h2>3D Rotations\</h2> \<p>Now that we've got a 3D space going on, we can define rotations along all three axes.\</p> \<p>This is done with:
\<code>\<attr>rotateX(\</attr>\<em>angle\</em>\<attr>)\</attr>\</code>,
\<code>\<attr>rotateY(\</attr>\<em>angle\</em>\<attr>)\</attr>\</code> and
\<code>\<attr>rotateZ(\</attr>\<em>angle\</em>\<attr>)\</attr>\</code>.\</p>
\<pre data-lang="css"\> div { transform: rotateX(45deg) rotateY(10deg) rotateZ(-45deg); } \</pre> \<p>There's also the shorthand
\<code>rotate3d(\<em>x, y, z, angle\</em>)\</code>. Here, you set one angle (the fourth parameter), and the \<em>x, y, z\</em> values specify to what extent the axis is rotated by that angle.\</p> \<p>For example,
\<code>rotate3d(1,0,0,45)\</code> rotates the x-axis by 45 degrees. I know, it seems more complicated than it should be.\</p> \<h2>3D World Settings\</h2> \<p>A webpage is 2D by default, which means 3D is a whole different beast, and requires you to make some decisions about what to do.\</p> \<p>The \<code>transform-style\</code> property determines what happens to the children of a transformed element. The default value is
\<code>flat\</code>, which means that children are affected and taken into account, but you can set it to \<code>preserve-3d\</code> to let the children stay where they are.\</p> \<p>The
\<code>perspective\</code> property determines how far away or close by
\<em>children\</em> of the element are placed. This can be any number. The default is 0, which means there is no difference in depth and the element appears flat.\</p> \<p>The \<code>perspective-origin\</code> property sets the so-called \<em>vanishing point\</em> for this perspective. It takes two arguments, which represent the position on the
\<strong>x-axis\</strong> and \<strong>y-axis\</strong>, respectively. These can be numbers, but you can also set them with those words you've become familiar with by now: \<em>left, center, right\</em> for the x-axis, \<em>top, center, bottom\</em> for the y-axis.\</p> \<p>And finally, the \<code>backface-visibility\</code> property determines whether the back face of a 3D element, which you see if it's rotated, is visible. The default value is \<code>visible\</code>, but you can hide it with \<code>hidden\</code>.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { backface-visibility: hidden; transform-style: flat; perspective: 50px; perspective-origin:50% 0; } \</pre> " slug: "css3-transforms" cat:

"\[CSS3\] Transitions & Animations" post: "\<p>Up until now, CSS has been quite harsh on our elements. It only allows exact values for its properties, and if you hover over something it immediately jumps to another set of rules. We sometimes want there to be a nice, fluid transition between states, and CSS has that covered as well!\</p>
\<h2>Transitions\</h2> \<p>Using the \<code>transition\</code> property, we can specify a time-period over which to change certain properties. These properties are in the familiar comma-separated list.\</p> \<p>Such a transition can take four arguments, of which the first two are compulsory:\</p> \<table> \<tbody> \<tr> \<td> \<p>Value\</p> \</td>
\<td> \<p>Description\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>property\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>The property to create a transition for.\</p> \<p>Anything with numbers or colours can be animated.\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>duration\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>How long the transition takes to complete.\</p> \<p>Can be any positive number, with the unit \<strong>s\</strong> (seconds)\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>timing-function\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>How this time is distributed, takes an \<strong>easing function\</strong> as value.\</p> \<p>For example, you can set it to transition quickly the first half and then slow down the second half.\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr>
\<td> \<p>\<code>delay\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>How long it takes for the transition to start. Can be any positive number, with the unit
\<strong>s\</strong>.\</p> \<p>Default is \<strong>0s
\</strong>(transition starts immediately, which is often what you want).\</p> \</td> \</tr> \</tbody> \</table> \<pre data-lang="css"\> a { transition: color 1s linear 0; } \</pre> \<p>You can also set any of these values for transition as a whole, instead of specifying them for every property individually. For this, you can use the properties:\</p>
\<ul>\<li>\<code>transition-property\</code>\</li>\<li>\<code>transition-duration\</code>\</li>\<li>\<code>transition-timing-function\</code>\</li>\<li>\<code>transition-delay\</code>\</li>\</ul>
\<pre data-lang="css"\> a { transition-property: color, transform; transition-duration: 1s, 2s; transition-timing-function: linear, ease-in; transition-delay: 0s, 1s; } \</pre> \<h2>Easing Functions\</h2>
\<p>An easing function is basically a graph, going from y=0% to y=100%. The way the graph goes (e.g., linear, parabolic), shows how fast or slow the transition is going at a certain moment in time.\</p> \<img src="media/CSS3EasingFunctions.png" /> \<p>These values are available:\</p> \<table> \<tbody> \<tr> \<td> \<p>Value\</p> \</td>
\<td> \<p>Description\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>ease\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Semi-fast start, fast middle, slow finish. Default value.\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>linear\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Same, constant speed from start to finish\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>ease-in\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Slow start, then constant speed\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>ease-out\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Constant speed, slow finish\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>ease-in-out\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Slow start, fast middle, slow finish.\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>cubic-bezier(\<em>a,b,c,d\</em>)\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td>
\<p>Your own custom easing function, with numbers between 0 and 1 as input.\</p> \<p>Quite tricky to explain, but think of it as (a/b) and
(c/d) being the slope of the easing graph at start and end point, respectively.\</p> \</td> \</tr> \</tbody> \</table>
\<h2>Animations\</h2> \<p>Animations take this concept one step further. You can define exactly what you want to happen, how, and when. Adding an animation to your element works in two steps: defining the animation, and calling the animation from the element.\</p> \<h2>Defining Animations\</h2> \<p>To define a single animation, we use the
\<code>\<attr>\@keyframes\</attr> \<namehere>\</code> selector. You can use any name you like, as long as it doesn't contain any special characters. Within the selector, you need to specify which styles you want applied at what time within the animation. This is, in theory, the same as with gradients\-\--you define certain time stops where you set new styles, and the animation automatically makes the values fade into each other nicely.\</p> \<p>The syntax is \<code>\<attr>\<percentage>
{\</attr> \<em>styles\</em> \<attr>}\</attr>\</code>, where 0% is the start of the animation, and 100% the end.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\>
\@keyframes coolAnimation { 0% { color:blue; } 50% { color:red; } 100% { color:blue; } } \</pre> \<p>It's as simple as that! Now this general animation can be called from any element, which is what we'll look at next.\</p> \<h2>Running the Animations\</h2> \<p>This works roughly the same way as with transitions. You can set the properties:\</p>
\<ul>\<li>\<code>animation-name\</code>\</li>\<li>\<code>animation-duration\</code>\</li>\<li>\<code>animation-timing-function\</code>\</li>\<li>\<code>animation-delay\</code>\</li>\</ul>
\<p>But, on top of that, some extra properties exist:\</p> \<table>
\<tbody> \<tr> \<td> \<p>Property\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Description
&amp; Values\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>animation-direction\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Defines how the animation is played.\</p> \<p>\<code>normal\</code> is the default value (0% => 100%)\</p> \<p>\<code>reverse\</code> plays the animation in reverse (100% => 0%)\</p> \<p>\<code>alternate\</code> switches between normal and reverse\</p> \<p>\<code>alternate-reverse\</code> switches between reverse and normal\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>animation-fill-mode\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Defines styles to apply to an element with an animation when it isn't being played.\</p> \<p>\<code>none\</code> is the default value\</p>
\<p>\<code>forwards\</code> means that after the animation ends, the element keeps the last property values provided\</p>
\<p>\<code>backwards\</code> means that it already takes on the property values of the first time stop of the next iteration (in case the animation is paused or delayed).\</p> \<p>\<code>both\</code> means that both \<em>forwards\</em> and \<em>backwards\</em> apply.\</p> \</td>
\</tr> \<tr> \<td> \<p>\<code>animation-iteration-count\</code>\</p>
\</td> \<td> \<p>How often to play the animation\</p> \<p>Takes any positive number, without unit.\</p> \<p>Setting it to
\<code>infinite\</code> keeps the animation playing forever and ever.\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>animation-play-state\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Whether the animation is running or not.\</p> \<p>\<code>running\</code> is the default value, which means that as soon as the element is loaded the animation starts\</p> \<p>\<code>paused\</code> means it is paused, and you can decide for yourself when you start it.\</p> \</td> \</tr>
\</tbody> \</table> \<pre data-lang="css"\> a:hover { animation-name:coolAnimation; animation-duration:0.5s; animation-timing-function:ease-out; animation-direction:alternate; animation-iteration-count:infinite; animation-play-state:running; }

"\[CSS3\] Responsive Design" post: "\<p>I've mentioned the word several times already, but now that you've got all this basic (and advanced) CSS knowledge, we can finally take a peek into the world of responsive design. It's a large world, with lots of different ways to do lots of different things, but I will explain to you the fundamental concepts (and mostly properties) that play a role.\</p> \<p>Responsive design is design that adapts to different viewport sizes. It changes the layout depending on the room it has to display it. Websites that simply scale all elements to fit to different screen sizes, I like to call semi-responsive. It's a good idea, but a certain moment elements are just going to be too small to read. That's why there's an extra component to responsive design, which takes care of showing or hiding elements, and their placement on the page.\</p> \<p>\<img src="media/CSS3ResponsiveDesign.png" />\</p> \<p>There's three different parts you'll need to look at: HTML viewport settings, creating a fundamentally flexible CSS design, and writing different style sheets for specific sizes and devices.\</p> \<h2>HTML Viewport\</h2> \<p>HTML5 introduced a new attribute for the
\<code>\<meta>\</code> tag, which is
\<code>\<attr>name\</attr>="viewport"\</code>. Within the
\<code>content\</code> attribute, you can set how you want devices to interpret your page when it comes to the scaling of elements.\</p>
\<p>If this tag isn't used, browsers will downscale websites to fit all content on tiny screens. This is okay, because the user can zoom in and view everything, but isn't really preferred.\</p> \<p>To prevent this behaviour, set the value of the content attribute to
\<code>width=device-width;initial-scale:1.0;\</code>\</p> \<pre data-lang="html"\> \<meta name="viewport" content="width:device-width;initial-scale:1.0;"\> \</pre>
\<h2>Flexible CSS\</h2> \<p>For this, the \<strong>flexbox\</strong> environment and \<strong>multicolumn\</strong> layout were invented, which is what next chapters are all about.\</p> \<h2>Multiple style sheets\</h2> \<p>Using so-called \<strong>media queries\</strong> you can specify when to use a certain style sheet. For example, if the viewport width is smaller than 500 pixels, you could completely change the layout to accommodate for that lack of space or different aspect ratio. After the flexible CSS chapters, the last chapter of the course is about this. Then, you can finally say you know everything that is CSS!\</p> " slug: "css3-responsive-design" cat: "Website" subcat:
"CSS3" video: "" diff: 2 quiz: "" - id: 215 title: "\[CSS3\] Flexbox" post: "\<p>Brace yourself, because this is going to be a long one, and all of it's important.\</p> \<p>A flexbox is a flexible box. You can tell an element to become a flexbox, and all children within it will become so-called flex items. From that moment on, everything inside the container will automatically adapt to changes, and there's a lot of properties you can use to specify \<em>how\</em> it adapts.\</p>
\<h2>Creating a Flexbox\</h2> \<p>You convert an element into a flexbox by using \<code>\<attr>display\</attr>:flexbox\</code> or
\<code>\<attr>display\</attr>:inline-flexbox\</code>, depending on whether you want it to be block level or inline. All its \<em>direct children\</em> (elements that have this flexbox element as their parent) automatically become flex items.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\>
#mainContainer { display:flex; } #mainContainer \> div { /\* This is automatically a flex-item \*/ } #mainContainer div div { /\* This is not
\*/ } \</pre> \<h2>Settings for the Container Element\</h2> \<p>Let's start by discussing the properties you can use on the container element, the one that you converted to a flexbox. These properties determine how all flex items are distributed throughout the container.\</p>
\<h5>Direction\</h5> \<p>The \<code>flex-direction\</code> property establishes the main axis\-\--the direction in which all elements will be laid out.\</p> \<img src="media/CSS3FlexboxDirection.png" />
\<p>Its values are \<code>row\</code> (left to right),
\<code>row-reverse\</code> (right to left), \<code>column\</code> (top to bottom), and \<code>column-reverse\</code> (bottom to top).\</p>
\<pre data-lang="css"\> div { flex-direction:row; } \</pre>
\<h5>Wrap\</h5> \<p>By default, flexbox will try to fit all flex items into one row/column. The \<code>flex-wrap\</code> property can change that.\</p> \<img src="media/CSS3FlexboxWrap.png" /> \<p>The default value is \<code>nowrap\</code>. To make it wrap\-\--that is, start a new row if it doesn't have any space anymore to place the next flex item\-\--use the \<code>wrap\</code> value. Use
\<code>wrap-reverse\</code> if you want flex items ordered right to left.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { flex-wrap:wrap; } \</pre>
\<h5>Justifying Content\</h5> \<p>Just as text can be aligned, flex items can also be aligned in all sorts of ways. The
\<code>justify-content\</code> property handles this.\</p> \<img src="media/CSS3FlexboxJustify.png" /> \<p>The possible values are:\</p> \<ul> \<li>\<code>flex-start\</code>: items are floated towards the start line\</li> \<li>\<code>flex-end\</code>: items are floated towards the end line\</li> \<li>\<code>center\</code>: items are centred\</li> \<li>\<code>space-between\</code>: the first item is floated towards the start line, the last item towards the end line, and the space in between is distributed evenly among the flex items\</li>
\<li>\<code>space-around\</code>: all flex items have an equal amount of space around it\</li> \</ul> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { justify-content: space-between; } \</pre> \<h5>Aligning Content\</h5>
\<p>I know, \<code>align-content\</code> seems as if this is the exact same thing as the previous property. But, this actually determines the alignment of the cross axis; the one perpendicular to the direction axis.\</p> \<p>For example: if you set the direction to row, justify-content determines the horizontal alignment, but align-content determines the vertical alignment.\</p> \<img src="media/CSS3FlexboxAlignContent.png" /> \<p>It takes the same values, plus an additional one: \<code>stretch\</code>.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { align-content: stretch; } \</pre>
\<h5>Aligning Items\</h5> \<p>\<em>What? Again?\</em> No, this one is more specific. The \<code>align-items\</code> property doesn't determine how a complete row or column is aligned, but how items are laid out individually, relative to each other.\</p> \<img src="media/CSS3FlexboxAlignItems.png" /> \<p>The values it takes are\</p> \<ul> \<li>\<code>flex-start\</code>: the top of every item is pushed against the top of the cross-axis\</li>
\<li>\<code>flex-end\</code>: the bottom of every item is pushed against the bottom of the cross-axis\</li> \<li>\<code>center\</code>: all items are aligned at their own centre point\</li>
\<li>\<code>baseline\</code>: items are aligned in such a way that their baselines (imaginary line that all text sits on) align\</li>
\<li>\<code>stretch\</code>: stretch them all to fill the container. The default value.\</li> \</ul> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { align-items: flex-end; } \</pre> \<h2>Settings for the Flex Items\</h2> \<p>All these properties for all items as a whole are great, but we often want some elements to have a unique size or position. You should, therefore, think of these properties as overriding the main behaviour. First you set the main properties on your whole flexbox, and then you start tweaking them for some individual flex items\-\--not the other way around.\</p>
\<h5>Basic Size\</h5> \<p>The \<code>flex-basis\</code> property determines the basic size of a flex item. The default value is
\<code>auto\</code>, which means it scales to fit the flex container, or looks at the width/height properties if you've set those. If you set it to 0, it only scales to fit the content. If you supply it any other number, it will make it that long on the main axis (so it influences width if the flexbox is set to row, and height if set to column).\</p>
\<img src="media/CSS3FlexboxBasis.png" /> \<pre data-lang="css"\>
#specialDiv { flex-basis: 200px; } \</pre> \<h5>Growing and Shrinking\</h5> \<p>When the remaining space is distributed, that space can be positive or negative. Positive space means we have some space left over and could scale some items to fill it, while negative space means we're taking up too much space and need to reduce the size of some items.\</p> \<p>For the first case, we have
\<code>flex-grow\</code>, and for the second there's
\<code>flex-shrink\</code>.\</p> \<img src="media/CSS3FlexboxGrowShrink.png" /> \<p>They both accept a factor\-\--a number with no unit. The default is 1, which means an item simply stays at the same scale.\</p> \<p>NOTE: Because it's a factor, it doesn't say exactly how much something can or will scale, but rather how much space it receives or loses relative to the other flex items.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> #bigDiv { flex-grow: 2; }
#smallDiv { flex-shrink: 3; } \</pre> \<h5>Overriding Alignment\</h5>
\<p>If you want a single flex item to be aligned differently than is determined in the general \<code>align-items\</code> property, you need to use the \<code>align-self\</code> property, which takes the same values.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> #weirdDiv { align-self: flex-start; } \</pre> \<h5>Order\</h5> \<p>And finally, if you want the items to appear in a different order than you specified in the HTML, you can use the \<code>order\</code> property. Its value is an integer\-\--a ranking number with no unit, so to speak. This can be negative as well, if you want.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> #weirdDiv { order: 5; }
#firstDiv { order: -10; } \</pre> \<p>\<em>Why wouldn't I just put elements in the correct order in the source?\</em> Well, for example, the homepage of this website uses a flexbox with the order property randomly determined to get a different front page every time you visit! There could also be semantic reasons you'd want the HTML elements to be in a certain order, but the layout in another.\</p> " slug:

\<strong>multi-column\</strong> layout. It's a layout that is somehow very popular in print, but\-\--until recently\-\--not at all on the web. A good reason for this could be because it was hard to implement it, and that bottleneck seems to disappear with these new multi-column properties. Don't worry, it's not as difficult and large as flexbox.\</p> \<img src="media/CSS3MultiColumn.png" /> \<h2>Declaring columns\</h2> \<p>You can make any block level element a column layout. This is done with the \<code>columns\</code> property, which takes two values: \<code>column-count\</code> and \<code>column-width\</code>. You can set these properties individually if you like, but it's always recommended to set them both using the shorthand.\</p> \<h5>Column Count\</h5> \<p>Sets the amount of columns. No matter how wide the element is, that amount of columns is used, and all columns are scaled to make it fit. Takes an \<strong>integer\</strong> (without unit) as a value.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { column-count:5; } \</pre>
\<h5>Column Width\</h5> \<p>The other way to do it, is by setting a fixed column width and letting that decide how many columns should be used. It takes any \<strong>number\</strong> as a value, and all columns will always be that width.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { column-width:500px; } \</pre> \<h2>The Shorthand Property\</h2> \<p>Now why is it recommended to set them both? Because then things become responsive! If both are set, column-width only determines the
\<em>minimum\</em> width, and column-count the \<em>maximum\</em> amount of columns.\</p> \<p>If you then resize your browser window, it will remove or add columns based on how much space there is\-\--and that is what you want.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { columns:500px 5; }
\</pre> \<h2>Column Gap\</h2> \<p>The \<code>column-gap\</code> property determines the amount of white space between two columns. The default values is 1em, and it takes any non-negative number as value.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { column-gap:20px; } \</pre> \<h2>Column Rule\</h2> \<p>The \<code>column-rule\</code> property allows you to add a \<em>border\</em> in that column gap.

\<code>column-rule-width\</code>, \<code>column-rule-style\</code> and
\<code>column-rule-color\</code>.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { column-rule:1px solid #CCC; } \</pre> \<h2>Column Span\</h2> \<p>And finally, the \<code>column-span\</code> property allows you to break elements out of the column flow. The default value is \<code>1\</code>, which means that any element within the column environment spans one column only. The only other value it can have is \<code>all\</code>, which means that the element is moved downwards to be able to span across all columns, and then the column layout continues again. Mostly useful for headings or pictures within a column environment.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> div { columns: 200px 3; } div h1 { column-span:all;

They aren't used often at all, but sometimes they are
\<em>exactly\</em> what you need, and they can simplify your life quite a bit.\</p> \<h2>Counters\</h2> \<p>Counters are variables maintained by CSS. You can ask CSS to count how often it finds an element, and display that information somewhere. It's often used to create fancy numbered lists, or to dynamically number pages or slides on a website. It can only be used with the \<code>::before\</code> and \<code>::after\</code> pseudo-elements.\</p> \<p>The \<code>counter-reset\</code> property
\<em>sets\</em> as well as \<em>resets\</em> a counter. It takes any name you want to give it as value. As always, no special characters are allowed in that name. From the first moment you use this property, CSS can use that name as variable, and it's only reset once you call it again.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> ul { counter-reset:coolCounter; }
\</pre> \<p>The \<code>counter-increment\</code> property adds to the counter. If you only supply the counter name, it increments it with 1. If you add a value after it, it adds that value.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> li { counter-increment:coolCounter; } .evenList li { counter-increment:coolCounter 2; } \</pre> \<p>Now, to display the value of the counter at the moment this element is evaluated, use
\<code>\<attr>counter(\</attr>\<counter name>\<attr>)\</attr>\</code>. Remember, therefore, that the order of all these CSS declarations is important. Also remember that you need to supply this value to the
\<code>content\</code> property, because we're working with before and after pseudo-elements.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> li::before { content:counter(coolCounter); } \</pre> \<p>For
\<strong>subsections\</strong>, use
\<code>\<attr>counters(\</attr>\<counter name>,
\<separator>\<attr>)\</attr>\</code> to get all instance of your counter, added together using the separator. This can be useful, for example, if you have a list within a list.\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> li::before { content: counter(coolCounter, "."); }
\</pre> \<h2>Filters\</h2> \<p>Filters can be used on an image, and it is exactly what it sounds like. You can use the \<code>filter\</code> property on an image to add a nice filter to it, and you can give it these values:\</p> \<table> \<tbody> \<tr> \<td> \<p>Value\</p> \</td>
\<td> \<p>Description\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>blur(\<em>px\</em>)\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Blurs the image the amount of pixels specified.\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>brightness(\<em>%\</em>)\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td>
\<p>Adjusts the brightness.\</p> \<p>0% will make the image completely black\</p> \<p>100% is default and shows the original image\</p>
\<p>Greater than 100% will make the image brighter ( = whiter).\</p>
\</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td> \<p>\<code>contrast(\<em>%\</em>)\</code>\</p>
\</td> \<td> \<p>Adjusts the contrast.\</p> \<p>0% will make the image completely black\</p> \<p>100% is default and shows the original image\</p> \<p>Greater than 100% will reduce contrast\</p> \</td> \</tr>
\<tr> \<td> \<p>\<code>drop-shadow(\<em>x y\<br/> blur spread colour\</em>)\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Applies a drop shadow, exactly like the CSS property \<code>box-shadow\</code>\</p> \</td>
\</tr> \<tr> \<td> \<p>\<code>grayscale(\<em>%\</em>)\</code>\</p>
\</td> \<td> \<p>Converts the image to grayscale. Negative values are not allowed.\</p> \<p>0% is default and represents the original image\</p> \<p>100% will make the image completely grey.\</p> \</td>
\</tr> \<tr> \<td> \<p>\<code>hue-rotate(\<em>deg\</em>)\</code>\</p>
\</td> \<td> \<p>Applies a hue rotation to the image. This simply means that all colours are shifted a certain amount of degrees around the famous colour circle.\</p> \<p>0deg is default and shows the original image, 360deg is the maximum value.\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>invert(\<em>%\</em>)\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Inverts the image. Negative values are not allowed.\</p> \<p>0% is default and shows the original image\</p> \<p>100% will make the image completely inverted.\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>opacity(\<em>%\</em>)\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Sets the opacity for the image, just like the CSS \<code>opacity\</code> property.\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>saturate(\<em>%\</em>)\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td>
\<p>Saturates the image (makes colours more pure and less grey). Negative values are not allowed.\</p> \<p>0% makes the image completely unsaturated ("dull")\</p> \<p>100% is default and shows the original image\</p> \<p>Greater than 100% shows a supersaturated image
("bright")\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>
\<p>\<code>sepia(\<em>%\</em>)\</code>\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Converts the image to sepia. Negative values are not allowed.\</p> \<p>0% is default and shows the original image\</p> \<p>100% will make the image completely sepia.\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>

If that is the case, you have one last option to resort to: media queries. You check the type of media and the size of the viewport, and apply a different or extra style sheet for it. Of course, writing such a statement for \<em>every\</em> possible device is tedious, which means most people group them using max-width and min-width features.\</p> \<p>A media query always has the following syntax:\</p> \<pre data-lang="css"\> \@media mediatype and (media feature) { /\* Your CSS Code \*/ } \</pre> \<p>As you can see, we query the media with \<code>\@media\</code>, use a few special selectors, and then write CSS selectors and declarations like we're used to.\</p>
\<p>You could, if you want, write these CSS rules in a separate file and link to it using the HTML \<code>\<link>\</code> tag in the head of your page:\</p> \<pre data-lang="html"\> \<link rel="stylesheet" media="mediatype and\|not\|only (media feature)" href="myspecialstylesheet.css"\> \</pre> \<p>I must admit I've never used that, but if your style sheets get really large, it might be a wise thing to do.\</p> \<h2>Media Types\</h2> \<p>There's 4 different media types you can apply:\</p> \<table> \<tbody> \<tr> \<td> \<p>Media Type\</p> \</td> \<td> \<p>Description\</p> \</td> \</tr> \<tr> \<td>

Still, it was very quick and bare bones, and the only way to get comfortable with how everything works is by experimenting and building projects.\</p>
\<p>Using HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge, you can build a very beautiful and well-structured website. You can try to build your own homepage now, or a blog, or anything you like. But, you'll soon run into some problems, which is that you can't really make your websites dynamic. Yes, you can add an animation when somebody hovers over a button\-\--but how do you make the button do something when the user clicks on it?\</p>
\<p>That's what JavaScript is for. It's a scripting language\-\--the name does give it away a little\-\--that adds interaction and dynamic to your website. You can do virtually anything with it, and I recommend you learn that now. Just as CSS, it has its own syntax and whole set of rules and basic concepts, but was made to work and integrate perfectly with CSS and HTML, which makes things easier.\</p> \<p>However, if you want to learn how to save websites on a server, and upload and load data from it (like blog posts, your own files, portfolio images), you're better off learning PHP now.\</p> \<p>Either way, I think in the end you want to master both, and it's up to you where you want to start. The web is a wonderful place, but if you really want to know what's behind it, and create your own wonderful projects from scratch, there's some work to be done ;) Have fun!\</p> \<p>NOTE (last one, I promise): CSS3 is constantly evolving. I recommend checking MDN once in a while to see what's new, what's in, and what's out. Sometimes features become deprecated and are removed from browsers, other times an amazing new idea is adopted by all browsers within mere months.\</p>
