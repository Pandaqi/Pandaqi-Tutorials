Card tricks are usually the first step to becoming a great magician. Not only because they are simpler and easier than most tricks, also because they only require a regular deck of cards. Card tricks can be done quickly, anywhere you want, which makes them the perfect tool to liven up a party, impress someone, or just simply pass the time.
