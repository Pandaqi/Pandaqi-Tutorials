The course has almost come to an end, but not before we discuss some ways to stay motivated and enjoy the beautiful craft that writing is.

Start a New Project
-------------------

Let me first get this straight: writing requires commitment---be prepared to work hard. Writing is a huge creative process that takes a lot of time and energy, without actually knowing if it is going to work. Only when your story is finished and you show it to your publisher you know if all the work you did was any good. I am not saying this to demotivate you. I am telling you that you need to full commit yourself to any new project.

These few steps will help you get started:

*   **Create an editing support group:** Create a support network of friends, colleagues, editors, experts and coaches who can give you feedback on your work. Having someone believe in you goes a long way.
*   Break (long) projects into parts, long stories into chapters. A page a day is a book a year.
*   **Write a Mission Statement:** determine what you want to achieve or learn from writing the story, and try to figure out everything about those skills while writing it.
*   Do not come lightly to **the blank page**. You can approach it any way you like---afraid, excited, hopeful, to impress a girl or to change the world---but **not** without the slightest emotion or idea what you are going to do.

Keeping the Motivation and Spirit
---------------------------------

Try out all tools from this course, and use them (one at a time) enough to make them into habits. Your writing should flow, be natural and the guidelines should over time be applied automatically.

Rename procrastination to **rehearsal**. Taking time off, doing something else for a moment, helps clear your head and find new ways for the story to continue.

Write rapidly, _putting down the story exactly as it comes to mind_, only ever looking back to check character names or relevant parts of their back stories. If you can keep up with your original enthusiasm, you'll be able to outrun the self-doubt that's always waiting to settle in.

**Collaboration:** Take an interest in all crafts that (could) support your work. Help others in their crafts so they can help you.

**Write to entertain:** The first and foremost reason people read is because of entertainment. They want something to keep them busy, interested, thinking, happy, while at the same time relaxing from their work or other duties. Serious ideas must always serve your story, not the other way around.

Ask yourself frequently: _am I having fun?_ 

If the answer is always no, it's time for a new project. (If this happens repeatedly, maybe a new career.) If you're bored by your own project, unmotivated to write the next chapter, imagine how bored your readers will be.

**Experiment**: Try anything you like, no matter how weird or stupid. If it turns out to work wonderfully well, keep it in. If it doesn't, toss it and start again---nobody needs to know.

Criticism & Honesty
-------------------

**Learn from Criticism:** Do your best to tolerate even unreasonable criticism of your work as a way of growing as a writer. Don't defend your work, but explain what you were trying to accomplish.

Show your work to a number of people. Smile and nod while listening to their criticism. Then afterwards evaluate---if most of them point out the same thing, you should definitely look at it. If everybody points out something different, disregard it.

**Be honest with yourself:** If something is bad, kill it. You need reading experience to see what is mediocre or outright rotten. It helps you recognize those things when they begin to creep into our own work, and to steer clear of them.

**Be honest with your readers:** _Write what you know_. Don't pretend to know about things you've not experienced, or be able to do things when you really can't. Put your experience, adventures, thoughts and ideas into your work, not just something you think is cool. The collection of your knowledge is unique, and will bring honesty and truth to your characters, dialogue and scenarios.

The End
-------

It was a long read, I know, but you've finished the course on writing! Congratulations!

You can start writing that book you've always imagined now. You can edit or rewrite that old story you thought was only mediocre now.

But, you can also take a look at the other big writing course on plotting, narrative, publishing and getting inspired and creative.
