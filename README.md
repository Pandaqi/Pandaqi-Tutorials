# Pandaqi Tutorials

This is the full source code / project behind [Pandaqi Tutorials](https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/).

It's made using Hugo, which means it's a static website that I can generate and upload once in a while.

The actual website is inside `pandaqi-tutorials`, everything else is metadata or supportive documents for the project.

This is my oldest website. From time to time, I write courses filled with useful tutorials about any topic I _think_ I understand.

Nothing is hidden or changed for this public version. It's the actual website, as I build and host it. 

I'm open sourcing all my websites in an effort towards an open world based on sharing and transparency. It's the least I can do.
