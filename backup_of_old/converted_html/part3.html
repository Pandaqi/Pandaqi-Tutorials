  title: "Guide to (HTML5) Canvas"
  post: "<p>When HTML5 came around the corner, a new and very powerful element was introduced. I'm talking about the <code><canvas></code> element, which does exactly what you'd expect: create an empty canvas within a webpage, for you to paint your pretty pictures on. The element itself, just like the rest of HTML, doesn't have any complexity to it; all you need to do is type it, and your canvas is ready to be used. To do anything meaningful with it, though, JavaScript is used. JavaScript has lots of objects and methods designed specifically for the canvas, and those are what this course will teach you. Therefore, before you start, make sure you know the basics of HTML and JavaScript. The first chapter will take you by the hand and remind you of everything, but I subsequently keep the examples clean and simple.</p> 

<p>Because JavaScript is used to create, draw and modify the canvas, there's a lot more to it than just <em>creating a picture</em>. For example, the main use of the canvas is for creating games right in your web browser. This course will not really focus on that particular aspect, but I just wanted to tell you what you could use all this information for.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

  title: "[Canvas] The canvas Element"
  post: "<p>From an HTML perspective, creating a canvas is nothing special. It's just a regular tag with no extraordinary attributes or syntax. To create a canvas, use:</p> 

<p><code class="longsyntax"><canvas id="<em>myID</em>" width="<em>width</em>" height="<em>height</em>"> <em>fallback text</em> </canvas></code></p>

<p>The <em>fallback text</em> is displayed only if a user's browser doesn't support this element.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of HTML, you shouldn't use CSS to set the width and height of the canvas. The canvas defaults to a size of <code>300px</code> (width) by <code>150px</code> (height), and if you set a width or height with CSS, it simply <em>stretches</em> or <em>shrinks</em> the original canvas image to be this size. Sometimes you want that, but more often than not you don't. If you want your canvas to be a specific size, set the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> <em>attributes</em> on the canvas element itself.</p>

<p>And last but not least, we need to set an <code>id</code> if we want to be able to access the canvas element with JavaScript. Of course, there are other ways to select elements, but this is by far the easiest.</p>

<h2>Timing</h2>

<p>One of the common issues with JavaScript is that you need to wait for elements to finish loading before you can access them. Therefore, any code that wants to manipulate the canvas needs to be executed at the right time. There are two common ways to do so: by placing your code <em>after</em> the canvas element within the body of the page, or by placing it inside a function that is called after the page has been loaded.</p>

<p>Accessing the canvas can be done in the same way you'd access any other element, with <code>getElementById()</code>, but that is not enough if we want to draw something on it. We need to access the part of the element that is responsible for drawing, which is done with <code>getContext('2d')</code>. Any time I refer to the <em>context</em> in this course, I mean this 2D context of the canvas. Any and every canvas method should be applied to its context, and not the element itself.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="html">
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="600" height="300">
  <p>Sorry, your browser doesn't support the CANVAS element.</p>
</canvas>
<script>
var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

//Perform canvas operations with the context stored in the ctx variable
//For example, creating a rectangle!
ctx.fillRect(10,10,100,100);
</script>
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<p>I will leave out this important bit of JavaScript in the examples from now on, but never forget to include it yourself!</p>

<h2>Coordinate System</h2>

<p>Before we continue our journey into the world of canvas, I need to clear up one thing. The coordinate system used is not like in traditional mathematics (<em>Cartesian coordinates</em>).</p>

<p>In the traditional system, moving <em>upwards</em> from the origin increases values on the y-axis. In the canvas system, the origin is at the top left corner, and moving <em>downwards</em> increases values on the y-axis.</p>

<img src="media/CanvasCoordinateSystem.png" />

<script>
var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.fillRect(10,10,100,100);

  title: "[Canvas] Paths"
  post: "<p>Essentially, every shape you draw is a bunch of points connected with lines, which we call a <strong>path</strong>. A path has to start somewhere, and can be closed when we've created all the necessary parts. For example, a rectangle is a path of four points with straight lines connecting them.</p> 

<p>To create a path, use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">beginPath();
	<em>any path methods</em>
closePath();</code></p>

<p>Closing the path is not strictly necessary, as beginning a new path automatically tells JavaScript that the previous one should be closed (we can't nest paths inside paths). The <code>closePath()</code> method therefore connects the first and last point with a straight line, literally closing the path.</p>

<h2>Displaying Paths</h2>

<p>Creating a path, however, is not enough to display it. Now JavaScript has a bunch of points connected in certain ways, but it doesn't know, for example, what colour to use. There are two different components of a path that can be styled, which is the <strong>stroke</strong> and the <strong>fill</strong>.</p>

<p>The <em>stroke</em> is the actual path, or outline of the path. When you draw a straight line between two points, you can display the line by displaying the stroke of the path.</p>

> To stroke the last shape you created, use <code>stroke()</code>

<p>The <em>fill</em> is how a path is filled. When you draw a rectangle, you can make it a blue rectangle by changing the fill to be blue.</p>

> To fill the last shape you created, use <code>fill()</code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.drawRect(10,10,100,100);
//At this point, nothing is displayed yet
ctx.stroke();
ctx.fill();
//Now the rectangle is filled and outlined with black
//Because the rectangle already is a closed shape, closePath() is not needed
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<p>As you might have noticed, we still haven't said anything about the colours or techniques to use for stroking/filling, in which case the canvas defaults to black. Throughout this course you'll learn ways to do that, but for now I want to focus on those <em>path methods</em> that actually create the shapes you want.</p>


<script>
var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.rect(10,10,100,100);
ctx.stroke();
ctx.fill();

  title: "[Canvas] Lines & Curves"
  post: "<p>Let's start with the most basic path elements of them all: straight and curved lines.</p> 

<h2>Straight Lines</h2>

<p>A straight line needs two things: a starting point, and subsequent points of the line.</p>

<p>Use <code>moveTo(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>)</code> to set the starting point to (<em>x,y</em>).</p>

<p>Use <code>lineTo(<em>x,</em> <em>y</em>)</code> to create a line from the previous point to (<em>x,y</em>). You can put as many of these methods as you want after each other, but the order in which you supply them matters a lot; the line it creates uses the last coordinates as starting point.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(10,10)
ctx.lineTo(20,50);
ctx.lineTo(50,20);
ctx.stroke();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Quadratic Curve</h2>

<p>A quadratic curve is a curved line between two points, which needs one extra control point to determine how exactly it is curved. The only difference from straight lines, therefore, is that instead of <code>lineTo()</code>, it uses:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">quadraticCurveTo(<em>controlX, controlY, x, y</em>) </code></p>

<img src="media/CanvasQuadraticCurveTo.png" />

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(10,10)
ctx.quadraticCurveTo(30,30,50,10);
ctx.stroke();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas2"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Bezier Curve</h2>

<p>The Bezier curve goes one step further, and needs two control points. This way, you make more complicated curves, going in two different directions between two points. Instead of <code>lineTo()</code>, it uses:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">bezierCurveTo(<em>controlX<sub>1</sub>, controlY<sub>1</sub>, controlX<sub>2</sub>, controlY<sub>2</sub>, x, y</em>)</code></p>

<img src="media/CanvasBezierCurveTo.png" />

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(10,10)
ctx.bezierCurveTo(30,10,60,30,80,10);
ctx.stroke();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas3"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Arc</h2>

<p>An arc is a (part of a) circle. It allows you to create perfectly round paths from one point to another, without doing difficult things with control points. The syntax is:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">arc(<em>x, y, r, startAngle, endAngle, direction</em>)</code></p>

<img src="media/CanvasArc.png" />

<p>Basically, the arc draws a circle with centre point (<em>x,y</em>) and radius <em>r</em>, but then only takes the part between <em>startAngle</em> and <em>endAngle</em>.</p>

<p>The last parameter, <em>direction</em>, can be either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. In the first case, the arc is drawn <em>clockwise</em>. In the second case, <em>counterclockwise</em>.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(30,30,20,0,Math.PI);
ctx.stroke();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas4"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Arc Lines</h2>

<p>Now you might be wondering: wouldn't it be great if we could not only use arcs as standalone paths, but also as part of a path? Well you're in luck, because instead of <code>lineTo()</code>, you can use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">arcTo(<em>x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, r</em>)</code></p>

<img src="media/CanvasArcTo.png" />

<p>Instead of using angles, it uses two points to set the size and direction of the arc.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(20,20);
ctx.arcTo(60,30,60,60,20);
ctx.stroke();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas5"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<p>NOTE: Such arcs are commonly used to create round corners for shapes.</p>

<script>
var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(10,10)
ctx.lineTo(20,50);
ctx.lineTo(50,20);
ctx.stroke();

canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas2');
ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(10,10)
ctx.quadraticCurveTo(30,30,50,10);
ctx.stroke();

canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas3');
ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(10,10)
ctx.bezierCurveTo(30,10,60,30,80,10);
ctx.stroke();

canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas4');
ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(30,30,20,0,Math.PI);
ctx.stroke();

canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas5');
ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(20,20);
ctx.arcTo(60,30,60,60,20);

  title: "[Canvas] Stroke Styles"
  post: "<p>Last chapter introduced lots of ways to create fancy lines, but their default black, thin stroke is already becoming quite boring. Not only can we use certain properties to make our lines bigger and in different colour, but there are also subtle changes to be made which can have a big impact</p> 

<h2>Line Width</h2>

<p>The size of the line. The default is <code>1</code>, which makes a stroke only <code>1px</code> wide. To change this, use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">lineWidth = <em>number</em></code></p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(20,20);
ctx.lineTo(80,20);
ctx.lineWidth = 10;
ctx.stroke();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Stroke Colour</h2>

<p>The colour of the line. The default is black, to change this use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">strokeStyle = <em>value</em></code></p>

<p>The <em>value</em> can be any valid CSS colour code, but also a variable that contains a gradient or pattern. You'll learn how to create those later.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(20,20);
ctx.lineTo(80,20);
ctx.strokeStyle = "red";
ctx.stroke();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas2"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Line Cap</h2>

<p>The <em>line cap</em> determines how the two end points of a line are styled. The syntax is:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">lineCap = <em>value</em></code></p>

<p>There are three possible values: <code>butt</code> (default), <code>round</code> and <code>square</code>.</p>

<img src="media/CanvasLineCap.png" />

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(20,20);
ctx.lineTo(80,20);
ctx.lineWidth = 30;
ctx.lineCap = 'round';
ctx.stroke();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas3"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Line Join</h2>

<p>This property determines how a point---one where two lines meet or <em>join</em>---is styled. The syntax is:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">lineJoin = <em>value</em></code></p>

<p>There are three possible values: <code>miter</code> (default), <code>round</code> and <code>bevel</code>. Especially on thicker lines, this can make a huge difference.</p>

<img src="media/CanvasLineJoin.png" />

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(20,60);
ctx.lineTo(60,20);
ctx.lineTo(100,60);
ctx.lineWidth = 30;
ctx.lineJoin = "bevel";
ctx.stroke();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas4"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Miter Limit</h2>

<p>The default method for joining lines has the nasty side-effect that it creates very large, sharp corners if the angle between two lines is very small. You can tell the canvas to cut off this so-called <em>miter</em> if it gets too long using an upper bound:</p>

<img src="media/CanvasMiterLimit.png" />

<p><code class="longsyntax">miterLimit = <em>number</em></code></p>
<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(20,60);
ctx.lineTo(30,20);
ctx.lineTo(40,60);
ctx.lineWidth = 10;
ctx.miterLimit = 3;
ctx.stroke();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas5"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Dashed Lines</h2>

<p>Dashed lines are lines consisting of dashes with gaps between them. They deviate a bit from the standard syntax we've been using thus far, because they require a method to set the line dash, instead of a property. The syntax is:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">setLineDash([<em>dash</em>, <em>gap</em>, &hellip;, <em>dash</em>, <em>gap</em>])</code></p>

<p>You can put as many of those <em>dash-gap</em> pairs as want in there. They basically create a pattern of stroke and no-stroke that is repeated all over the path.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(20,60);
ctx.lineTo(60,20);
ctx.lineTo(100,60);
ctx.lineTo(140,20);
ctx.lineWidth = 5;
//The pattern is short stroke (2), gap (3), long stroke (5), gap (3)
ctx.setLineDash([2,3,5,3]);
ctx.stroke();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas6"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<script>
var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(20,20);
ctx.lineTo(80,20);
ctx.lineWidth = 10;
ctx.stroke();

canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas2');
ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(20,20);
ctx.lineTo(80,20);
ctx.strokeStyle = "red";
ctx.stroke();

canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas3');
ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(20,20);

  title: "[Canvas] Shapes"
  post: "<p>Now that we've discussed everything that has to do with lines and stroking, it's time for shapes and their filling.</p> 

<h2>Rectangle</h2>

<p>To quickly create a rectangle, use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">rect(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>width</em>, <em>height</em>)</code></p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.rect(20,20,100,100);
ctx.stroke();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Quick Rectangles</h2>

<p>Because rectangles are so important, there are three methods that simplify the process of creating, stroking and filling a rectangle.</p>

<p>To create a filled rectangle (using the current fill settings), use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">fillRect(<em>x, y, width, height</em>)</code></p>

<p>To create a stroked rectangle (using the current stroke settings), use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">strokeRect(<em>x, y, width, height</em>)</code></p>

<p>To erase part of the canvas---setting all pixels to <em>transparent</em> black---use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">clearRect(<em>x, y, width, height</em>)</code></p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.strokeStyle="green";
ctx.strokeRect(20,20,100,100);
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas2"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Circles</h2>

<p>To create a circle, or semi-circle, one can simply use the <code>arc</code> method. If you create a semi-circle, don't forget to close off the path once you're done.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.fillStyle="green";
ctx.arc(50,50,30,0,2*Math.PI);
ctx.fill();

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.fillStyle="red";
ctx.arc(100,100,30,0,Math.PI);
ctx.closePath();
ctx.fill();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas3"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Custom Shapes</h2>

<p>We can create any custom shape we want simply by using a series of straight/curved lines, and then <em>closing</em> the path. There's no magic involved here!</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.fillStyle="green";

  title: "[Canvas] Fill Styles"
  post: "<p>Fortunately, there aren't as many different ways to <em>fill</em> a shape as there are to <em>stroke </em>it.  Unfortunately, most of these ways are a little more complex. The four ways to fill a path are: <strong>solid colour</strong>, <strong>linear gradient</strong>, <strong>radial gradient</strong>, and <strong>pattern</strong>.</p> 

<h2>Changing the Fill Style</h2>

<p>The same property is used for all four ways. Not surprisingly, the syntax is:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">fillStyle = <em>value</em></code></p>

<h2>Solid Colour</h2>

<p>To fill a shape with a solid colour, simply use any valid CSS colour code as value.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.fillStyle="blue";
ctx.rect(20,20,100,100);
ctx.fill();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Gradients</h2>

<p>To fill a shape with a gradient, you need to go through several steps. First you need to create your gradient and save it inside a variable, then you use this variable as the <em>value</em> for the fill style.</p>

<p>NOTE: I assume you have some gradient knowledge from CSS. If you don't, I strongly recommend learning CSS in the first place.</p>

<h3>Colour Stops</h3>

<p>As you know from CSS, gradients use colour stops to set points at which the colour should be changed, and it's not different with our canvas.</p>

<p>To set a colour stop, use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">addColorStop(<em>position</em>, <em>colour</em>)</code></p>

<p>A <em>position</em> of <code>0</code> is the start of the gradient, and <code>1</code> the end of it.</p>

<h3>Linear Gradient</h3>

<p>To create a <strong>linear gradient</strong>, use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">createLinearGradient(<em>startX</em>, <em>startY</em>, <em>endX</em>, <em>endY</em>)</code></p>

<p>This creates a gradient that moves along an imaginary line with starting point (<em>startX, startY</em>), and end point (<em>endX, endY</em>).</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
var grad = ctx.createLinearGradient(0,0,100,0);
grad.addColorStop(0,"red");
grad.addColorStop(1,"orange");

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.fillStyle=grad;
ctx.rect(20,20,100,100);
ctx.fill();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas2"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Radial Gradient</h3>

<p>To create a <strong>radial gradient</strong>, use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">createRadialGradient(<em>startX, startY, startR, endX, endY, endR</em>)</code></p>

<p>Radial gradients are defined as an area between two circles. The inner circle has centre point (<em>startX, startY</em>) and radius <em>startR</em>. The outer circle has centre point (<em>endX, endY</em>) and radius <em>endR</em>.</p>
<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
var grad = ctx.createRadialGradient(50,50,10,50,50,100);
grad.addColorStop(0,"red");
grad.addColorStop(1,"orange");

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.fillStyle = grad;
ctx.rect(20,20,100,100);
ctx.fill();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas3"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Patterns</h2>

<p>A pattern can be used to fill a shape with an image, or the contents of another canvas. If the pattern is smaller than the shape, it can be repeated, similar to the CSS <code>background-image</code> property.</p>

<p>To create a pattern, use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">createPattern(<em>image</em>, <em>repetition</em>)</code></p>

<p>The first parameter requires a variable holding an image or canvas <em>context</em>. (You'll learn about loading images later.)</p>

<p>The second parameter can have one of these four values:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<p>Value</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>"repeat"</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Repeats pattern in both directions (default)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>"repeat-x"</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Repeats pattern only in x-direction</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>"repeat-y"</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Repeats pattern only in y-direction</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>"no-repeat"</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Doesn't repeat the pattern at all</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>One tricky thing is that, if you load an image within the canvas itself, you'll need to wait for it to finish loading before you can assign it to a pattern. You'll learn everything about image loading soon.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
var imageObj = new Image();
imageObj.onload = function() {
	var pat = ctx.createPattern(imageObj,"repeat");
	ctx.beginPath();
	ctx.fillStyle = pat;
	ctx.rect(20,20,100,100);
	ctx.fill();
}
imageObj.src = 'image.png';
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas4"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<p>As stated earlier, these patterns and gradients can also be used on the <em>stroke</em> instead of fill. This doesn't require any extra syntax. Yay!</p>

<script>
var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.fillStyle="blue";

  title: "[Canvas] Text"
  post: "<p>Because HTML and CSS provide lots of ways to easily display and customize text, you might think you could just overlay your canvas with another element if you want text displayed there. This is true, and might sometimes be a good method, but using native text methods within the canvas is often much easier. They can be positioned exactly at the right spot, and styled by setting the right properties.</p> 

<h2>Displaying Text</h2>

<p>To display the phrase <em>text</em> at position (<em>x,y</em>), use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">fillText(<em>text</em>, <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>)</code></p>

<p>The default colour for text is, as always, <em>black</em>, and the default font the same as the default font for CSS.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.fillText("Hello Whale!", 10, 10);
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Styling Text</h2>

<p>If you want to style this text, you need to set a few properties <em>before</em> you call the <code>fillText()</code> method. Just as everything else, text is considered a shape, which means the colour can be determined with the <code>fillStyle</code> property. Similarly, the text can be stroked using the properties and methods you've already learned.</p>

<h2>Font Family &amp; Size</h2>

<p>Both the font and its display size are set with the same property:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">font = "<em>size</em> <em>font-family</em>"</code></p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.font = "36pt Calibri";
ctx.fillText("Hello Whale!", 10, 50);
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas2"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Aligning Text Horizontally</h2>

<p>To align the text, use:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">textAlign = <em>value</em></code></p>

<p>The possible values are: <code>left</code>, <code>center</code> and <code>right</code>. Additionally, if your document uses a specified text direction you can use <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> to refer to the start and end of lines. For instance, if your document uses <code>rtl</code> (for right-to-left), the start of the line actually means aligning it to the right.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.textAlign = "right";

ctx.font = "36pt Calibri";
ctx.fillText("Hello Whale!", 10, 50);
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas3"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Aligning Text Vertically</h2>

<p>To align the text horizontally, we change where the <em>baseline</em> is located. The baseline is, normally, the imaginary line that all letters sit on, and used for the y-position of the text. The syntax is:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">textBaseline = <em>value</em></code></p>

<p>The possible values are best displayed with a picture:</p>

<img src="media/CanvasTextBaselines.png" />

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.font = "36pt Calibri";
ctx.fillText("Hello", 10, 50);

ctx.textBaseline = "bottom";

ctx.fillText("Whale!", 120,50);
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas4"></canvas>
</div>
</div>


<h2>Text Wrapping &amp; Metrics</h2>

<p>What's important to notice, is that text within the canvas doesn't naturally wrap---you can't set a width, which means text will extend horizontally, infinitely.</p>

<p>If you want to measure the current width of text, use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">measureText(<em>text</em>).width</code></p>

<p>At the time of writing this method only returns width, but there are plans to make it calculate more than that.</p>

<p>This width can then, for example, be used to create a custom function that enables text wrapping.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
  /** @param ctx (Context we're drawing in)
    @param text (The text to wrap)
    @param x (x-position to place the text block)
    @param y (y-position to place the text block)
    @param maxWidth (Maximum length of a line, in pixels)
    @param lineHeight (height of one line)
  */
function wrapText(ctx, text, x, y, maxWidth, lineHeight) {
    var words = text.split(' ');
    var line = '';

    for(var n = 0; n < words.length; n++) {
      var testLine = line + words[n] + ' ';
      var metrics = ctx.measureText(testLine);
      var testWidth = metrics.width;
      if (testWidth > maxWidth && n > 0) {
        ctx.fillText(line, x, y);
        line = words[n] + ' ';
        y += lineHeight;
      }
      else {
        line = testLine;
      }
    }
    ctx.fillText(line, x, y);
}

wrapText(ctx,"This is a very long sentence trying to showcase a function designed to wrap text.",10,10,80,16);
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas5"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.fillText("Hello Whale!", 10, 10);

  title: "[Canvas] Transformations"
  post: "<p>Transformations, in CSS at least, are what you'd apply to a complete element to move, rotate or scale it. Transformations work that way in nearly all languages---but not canvas. You can't transform individual elements, but only the complete canvas. This allows you to modify multiple shapes (in the same way) at once, and add lots of transforms on top of each other. The obvious question here is: what if we want to reset all those transforms we've chained together, or just want to modify only a single shape at a time? For this, there is the <strong>state stack</strong>.</p> 

<h2>State Stack</h2>

<p>The state stack is simply a list of states you saved, in a certain order, that canvas keeps track of.</p>

<p>To save the current state of the canvas, which means the current set of transforms applied, use <code>save()</code>. This adds the current state on top of the state stack.</p>

<p>To restore the last state you saved, use <code>restore()</code>. This reads the state on top of the state stack, and resets the canvas to that state. Once that's done, this state is removed from the state stack.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
//Save inital state of canvas
ctx.save();

//Rotate the canvas, created filled rectangle
ctx.rotate(0.2*Math.PI);
ctx.fillRect(0,0,30,30);

//Restore the initial canvas state, without rotation
ctx.restore();
ctx.fillRect(35,35,20,20);
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas0"></canvas>
</div>
</div>
<p>The reason I wanted to start with this is because it becomes <em>very</em> important once you start using multiple transforms. Now let's look at all the available transforms!</p>

<p>NOTE: Even though the focus is on transforms here, the state of a canvas also saves all the currently set properties, such as <em>fillStyle</em> or <em>strokeStyle</em>. So, if you're working with canvasses with lots of objects, you'll still need to make heavy use of the state stack, even if you don't use transform operations.</p>

<h2>Translate</h2>

<p>To translate means to move the canvas. The syntax is</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">translate(<em>xOffset</em>, <em>yOffset</em>)</code></p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.fillRect(5,5,20,20);
ctx.translate(30,30);
ctx.fillRect(5,5,20,20);
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Rotate</h2>

<p>To rotate means, well, rotating the entire canvas around its origin. The syntax is</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">rotate(<em>radians</em>)</code></p>

<p>Note that the angle must be set in radians, not degrees.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
//Note that it uses the upper left corner as centre of rotation
ctx.rotate(0.1*Math.PI);
ctx.fillRect(50,50,30,30);
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas2"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Scale</h2>

<p>To scale means making the canvas larger/smaller, using the origin as the centre point. The syntax is</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">scale(<em>xScale</em>, <em>yScale</em>)</code></p>

<p>The default scale is 1, which means a value smaller than that makes everything smaller, and a value larger makes everything larger. Negative values are also allowed, and mirror/flip the canvas.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
//Scale canvas 150% both directions, flip everything vertically
ctx.scale(1.5,-1.5);

//Draw rectangle pointing upwards. 
//Note that we draw it above the canvas, as the scaling transformation uses the top of the canvas as its origin.
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(20,-40);
ctx.lineTo(40,-80);
ctx.lineTo(60,-40);
ctx.closePath();

ctx.stroke();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas3"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Custom Transforms</h2>

<p>With custom transforms you can easily perform multiple transform operations at the same time. That's why the method takes no less than six parameters:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">transform(<em>scaleX</em>, <em>skewX, skewY, scaleY, translateX, translateY</em>)</code></p>

<p>As you can see, rotation isn't easily achieved with this method. Another tiny problem is that things can behave unexpectedly, because you're applying so many transforms at the same time, <em>on top of</em> all the existing transforms.</p>

<p>To solve this, one extra method exists that removes all current transforms, before applying the new one you supply:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">setTransform(<em>scaleX</em>, <em>skewX</em>, <em>skewY</em>, <em>scaleY</em>, <em>translateX</em>, <em>translateY</em>)</code></p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.transform(1,5,5,1,30,30);

ctx.fillRect(0,0,50,50);
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas4"></canvas>
</div>
</div>


<h2>An Example: Ellipses</h2>

<p>One very basic shape we haven't seen yet are <em>ellipses</em>. Well, now we can make them with the help of some nifty transformations!</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
//Save state
ctx.save();

//Translate ctx
ctx.translate(20,20);

//Scale ctx horizontally
ctx.scale(2, 1);

//Draw circle which will be stretched into an oval
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(20,20,10, 0, 2 * Math.PI, false);

//Restore to original state
ctx.restore();

//Apply styling
ctx.fillStyle = '#8ED6FF';
ctx.fill();
ctx.lineWidth = 5;
ctx.strokeStyle = 'green';
ctx.stroke();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas5"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<script>
var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas0');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.save();
ctx.rotate(0.2*Math.PI);
ctx.fillRect(0,0,30,30);
ctx.restore();
ctx.fillRect(35,35,20,20);


canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');

  title: "[Canvas] Images"
  post: "<p>Using images within canvas is not as straightforward as you'd expect from HTML. But, just as with text, it's even more complex if you were to overlay your canvas with HTML images, which is why I recommend learning how to use images within canvas.</p> 

<p>NOTE: Everything described in this chapter requires an image to be present on the server the code is hosted on. If you use links to external images (hosted on other servers), you get a security error.</p>

<p>To display an image, you need to load it, then <em>wait for it to load</em>, and only once it's retrieved you can display it. Let's look at how this plays out in code:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">var imageObj = new Image();
imageObj.onload = function() {
	<em>//draw actual image</em>
}

imageObj.src = "<em>linkToImage</em>";</code></p>

<p>All it does is load an image object, point it to an image, and attach an event listener that executes once it has loaded.</p>

<h2>Actually Drawing the Image</h2>

<p>To draw the image, you only need to use a single method. This method, however, has quite a lot of parameters:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">drawImage(imageObj, <em>sourceX, sourceY, sourceWidth, sourceHeight, X, Y, Width, Height</em>)</code></p>

<p>The last four parameters are what determine the position and size of the image within the canvas.</p>

<p>The parameters with <em>source</em> in front are used to <code>crop</code> the original image.</p>

<img src="media/CanvasCropImages.png" />

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
var imageObj = new Image();
imageObj.onload = function() {
	//Cropped version
	ctx.drawImage(imageObj, 10, 10, 20, 20, 40, 40, 20, 20);
	//Full version
	ctx.drawImage(imageObj, 0, 0, 40, 40, 80, 40, 40, 40);
}
imageObj.src = 'image.png';
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Changing Images: Pixel by Pixel</h2>

<p>While most graphical programming languages gives us <em>filters</em> to modify images, the canvas gives us something more fundamental: we can access every pixel individually and change it. To access a certain rectangle of the canvas (which can contain anything), use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">getImageData(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>width</em>, <em>height</em>).data</code></p>

<p>This returns the pixel data within that rectangle as an array. This array starts at the upper left corner, and works through all pixels row by row. Every pixel has 4 elements within the array; one for the <em>red</em>, <em>blue</em>, <em>green</em> and <em>alpha</em> channel, respectively. We can just loop through this data array like we'd loop through any array, and assign new values (between 255 and 0) to every element.</p>

<p>Then, we can put this new pixel data back into the canvas with</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">putImageData(<em>data</em>, <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>)</code></p>

<p>Normally, you'd use the same <em>x</em> and <em>y </em> coordinates you used when getting the data, as you want to replace the same rectangle you extracted from the canvas.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
/**
Example that inverts the image you just saw about how to crop images.
*/
function drawInverted(imageObj) {
    var x = 10;
    var y = 10;

    //Draw original image
    ctx.drawImage(imageObj, x, y, 225, 100);

    //Access current pixel data
    var imageData = ctx.getImageData(x, y, imageObj.width, imageObj.height);
    var data = imageData.data;

    for(var i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
      //Red
      data[i] = 255 - data[i];
      //Green
      data[i + 1] = 255 - data[i + 1];
      //Blue
      data[i + 2] = 255 - data[i + 2];
    }

    //Overwrite original image
    ctx.putImageData(imageData, x, y);
  }
  
var imageObj = new Image();
imageObj.onload = function() {
	drawInverted(this);
};
imageObj.src = 'image.png';
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas2"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Saving Images: Data URLs</h2>

<p>Last but not least, there might be times when you want to save or copy the contents of a canvas. To do so, you need to convert a canvas to an image, and canvas uses PNG images for that. These are just strings of characters saved in a file, which means all we need to do to save an image, is get the <em>string</em> or <em>data URL</em> that represents it. To access this data URL of a canvas context, use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">toDataURL()</code></p>

<p>NOTE: This is the only method that works on the canvas itself, <em>not</em> the drawing context - we're not drawing anything, just accessing the canvas as a whole.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx.fillRect(10,10,50,50);
//Should show the string of characters the makes up this specific canvas in the console:
console.log(canvas.toDataURL());
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas3"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<script>
var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

var imageObj2 = new Image();
imageObj2.onload = function() {
	ctx.drawImage(imageObj2, 10, 10, 20, 20, 40, 40, 20, 20);
	ctx.drawImage(imageObj2, 0, 0, 40, 40, 80, 40, 40, 40);
}
imageObj2.src = 'media/LatexMathBIGODOT.png';

canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas2');
ctx2 = canvas.getContext('2d');
var curCtx = ctx2;

function drawInverted(imageObj,ctx) {
    var x = 10;
    var y = 10;

    ctx.drawImage(imageObj, x, y, 225, 100);

    var imageData = ctx.getImageData(x, y, imageObj.width, imageObj.height);
    var data = imageData.data;

    for(var i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
      // red
      data[i] = 255 - data[i];
      // green
      data[i + 1] = 255 - data[i + 1];
      // blue
      data[i + 2] = 255 - data[i + 2];
    }

    // overwrite original image
    ctx.putImageData(imageData, x, y);
  }
  
var imageObj = new Image();
imageObj.onload = function() {
	drawInverted(this,curCtx);
};
imageObj.src = 'media/CanvasCropImages.png';

canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas3');
ctx3 = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx3.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx3.fillRect(10,10,50,50);

  title: "[Canvas] Composites"
  post: "<p>Though the title of the chapter may be daunting, composites are a simple concept. A composite is a shape consisting of two shapes. In other words, they determine what happens when two shapes are composed together. There are four main topics: <strong>shadows</strong>, <strong>clipping</strong>, <strong>global alpha</strong> and <strong>global operations</strong>.</p> 

<h2>Shadows</h2>

<p>Drop shadows are very popular, and can be used to add a sense of depth or detail. As always, the canvas doesn't distinguish between different objects, which means you need to set the shadow properties before calling <code>fill()</code>. Four properties regarding shadows can be set:</p>

<p>Remember that, just like any other property, these stay in effect until you reset them or restore a canvas state.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.rect(10, 10, 50, 50);

ctx.shadowColor = '#999';
ctx.shadowBlur = 15;
ctx.shadowOffsetX = 10;
ctx.shadowOffsetY = 10;

ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx.fill();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Clipping</h2>

<p>Clipping means showing only that part of a shape that's inside another shape. To turn everything that's inside the canvas at that certain moment into a clip path, use the <code>clip()</code> method. Now, everything you draw afterwards will be clipped to that path, and only the parts inside the clip path displayed. However, you probably don't want everything to be clipped, which is why it's wise to save the state of the canvas before calling the <code>clip()</code> method, and restoring the previous state when you're done.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
//Save original state of canvas
ctx.save();

//Set clip path to a circle (the path itself is not displayed)
ctx.arc(50,50,30,0,2*Math.PI,false);
ctx.clip();

//Draw a rectangle that will automatically be clipped
ctx.fillRect(30,30,50,50);

//Restore original canvas state to get us out of the clipping path
ctx.restore();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas2"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Global Alpha</h2>

<p>You can set certain shapes to an alpha level other than 1 (fully opaque), simply by assigning it a transparent fill colour. But, you can also set the whole canvas to a certain opacity level, and everything you draw afterwards will have that alpha. To do so, set the <code>globalAlpha</code> property to a value between 0 and 1.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.globalAlpha = 0.5;

ctx.fillRect(10,10,40,40);

ctx.arc(50,50,40,0,2*Math.PI,false);
ctx.fill();
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas3"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Global Operations</h2>

<p>Like the global alpha, we can set a global composite operation to be applied to everything from there on. Not surprisingly, the property to change is <code>globalCompositeOperation</code>. Lots of values for operations are available, which this image will demonstrate:</p>

<img src="media/CanvasGlobalCompositeOperations.png" />

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
ctx.globalCompositeOperation = 'xor';

ctx.fillRect(10,10,40,40);
ctx.fillRect(40,10,40,40);
ctx.fillRect(25,30,40,40);
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas4"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<script>
var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.rect(10, 10, 50, 50);

ctx.shadowColor = '#999';
ctx.shadowBlur = 15;
ctx.shadowOffsetX = 10;
ctx.shadowOffsetY = 10;

ctx.fillStyle = 'red';

ctx.fill();

canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas4');
ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.globalCompositeOperation = 'xor';

  title: "[Canvas] Animation"
  post: "<p>Because canvas doesn't work with individual objects, it doesn't have support for animations in the usual way. With CSS, for example, you can select an element and change one of its properties over time, and you have an animation. With canvas, you have to constantly <em>redraw</em> the canvas with the next frame of the animation. This means that you need two things:</p> 

<ul>
	<li>A function containing a set of methods that draw what you want, depending on which frame you're on.</li>
	<li>A loop that calls this function at regular intervals</li>
</ul>

<p>Luckily, JavaScript doesn't leave you in the dark completely, and has a special method for calling a function at regular intervals:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">requestAnimationFrame(<em>function</em>)</code></p>

<p>This tries to call <em>function</em> at 60 FPS (frames per second), or every 1/60<sup>th</sup> of a second. It's perfectly possible though that your function is too heavy for the computer and can't be executed that quick, in which case the JavaScript just tries to call the function as quickly as possible. Another great advantage of this method is that it stops executing if you're not focused on the canvas. So, if you move to another tab, it stops wasting resources on keeping the animation running.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="javascript">
var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

requestAnimationFrame(animate);
var frame = 0;
var box = {x:0, y:20, colour:'red', width:30, height:30};

function animate() {
	//Clear whole canvas
	ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

	//Increase frame count
	frame++;

	//Make box slide to the right
	box.x += 0.5;

	//Redraw the box using new settings
	drawBox();

	//After 120 frames, reset the box
	if(frame == 120) {
		box.x = 0;
		frame = 0;
	}

	//Request our next frame!
	requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}

function drawBox() {
	ctx.beginPath();
	ctx.rect(box.x, box.y, box.width, box.height);
	ctx.fillStyle = box.colour;
	ctx.fill();
}
</pre>
<div>
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
</div>
</div>

<p>The example is really just an example in this case; it's up to you how you animate things. But, the usual practice is to update a set of global variables each frame, and use those variables to determine what must be drawn (and how) every frame.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about this method of animating and creating a dynamic canvas, I suggest looking at the course on HTML5 games.</p>

<script>
var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

requestAnimationFrame(animate);
var frame = 0;
var box = {x:0, y:20, colour:'red', width:30, height:30};

function animate() {
	ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
	frame++;
	box.x += 0.5;
	drawBox();
	if(frame == 120) {
		box.x = 0;
		frame = 0;
	}
	requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}

function drawBox() {
	ctx.beginPath();
	ctx.rect(box.x, box.y, box.width, box.height);
	ctx.fillStyle = box.colour;
	ctx.fill();
}

  title: "Fundamentals of Drawing"
  post: "<p>Learning to draw is not only useful if you want to become a painter, but applicable to all branches of life. In a business meeting, clear drawings help visualize what you're trying to say. In a game, imaginative drawings can take the gameplay to another level. This course therefore doesn't aim to teach you a particular style or (set of) technique(s), but tries to provide a general overview of the principles behind any type of image, such as depth, perspective and shading.</p> 

<p>While most people try to start their artistic career by just copying lots of illustrations (in the style they admire), I want to try a different approach. We'll still be copying lots of simple illustrations, but only to help you understand the concepts I explain. These concepts can, once understood, be transferred to any style or drawing you want. The main advantage is that you don't waste time learning to draw one specific object or style, but instead gain insight in the principles behind any image you'll ever encounter, or create yourself.</p>

<p>Having said this, you might be afraid that things will be very theoretical and boring, but don't worry; I promise I'll do my best to keep you inspired!</p>

<p>I recommend you read through all tutorials within this course, and only then pick your specialization. Even if you want to learn to draw simple comics, you still need to know how to quickly draw simple objects and people, which is exactly what this tutorial aims for.</p>

<p>NOTE: Of course, I need <em>some</em> style to showcase the principles, and for that I use an extremely simple yet realistic style. Simply put, things are drawn as they are seen, albeit a bit simplistically (as to not make such a basic course too complex). From this style you can develop your own; by leaving things out, for example, or adding your own details, slightly changing important curves or changing proportions.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Tools & Setup"
  post: "<p>Before we can start drawing, we need tools that allow us to do so. These days, there are two ways to draw: plain old pencil and paper (the traditional way), and using a computer and drawing tablet (the digital way). Whatever way you choose, the exact same principles apply, and only your tools will differ vastly. I would go so far as to say that digital painting has numerous advantages over the traditional method, and you should definitely try it---but only after you've completed this fundamental course! Without a basic understanding of perspective and shading, it doesn't matter how good you are with computers, your drawings will probably lack realism or style.</p> 

<h2>The Tools of the Trade</h2>

<p>For traditional drawing, I recommend these tools:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Paper</strong>, preferably a few stacked on top of each other.</li>
	<li><strong>Pencils</strong>, with different levels of thickness (and sharpened points, of course).</li>
	<li><strong>Erasers</strong> of different sizes. Use proper erasers that don't smudge the paper after you've used them once.</li>
	<li><strong>Pen</strong>, either regular or felt (tip).</li>
	<li><strong>Tape</strong>, to make sure your paper doesn't move as you draw.</li>
	<li><strong>Triangle</strong>, to be sure about your edges and straight lines.</li>
	<li><strong>Compass</strong>, to make precise circles.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DrawingTools.png" /></p>

<p>Additionally, it helps to get a piece of see-through plastic that you can paint on with markers. This way, you can look at objects and directly copy them on the plastic, and later copy those to the actual drawing (paper).</p>

<h2>The Talk of the Trade</h2>

<p>I tried my best to keep fancy terminology out of this course, but there will always be some core concepts that need clear names to clarify them. I must say, however, that not all of these names are fixed. Most artists prefer their own version of a concept, and have given different names to the same principle. When that's the case, I will mention it, but the real take away is: if you can find a better way to memorize or understand the technique, use it!</p>

<h2>Course Setup</h2>

<p>I initially wrote the course as a very theoretical one, but after I finished and read it a few times, it just seemed boring and not really helpful in a practical sense. So I rewrote the whole thing, with a new structure altogether. Next chapter will provide you with a quick overview of every concept you need to know, and after that we'll slowly build towards achieving that goal.</p>

<p>Every chapter starts with the reason why you need to know that particular thing, and the theory behind it that you just need to memorize. Then comes the fun part: exercises and practical applications! I'll explain lots of theory by showing you how to do it, and giving you a fun exercise to master it. Remember, only 20% of your skill comes from reading tutorials, the other 80% comes from practicing and training.</p>

<p>Ultimately, at the end of the course, you should be able to draw anything, be it from real life or imagination. How you fill in the details or make your drawing unique, is of course completely up to you---I'm only here to get you started.</p>

<h2>Before we Start</h2>

<p>Before we fly into the world of drawing, it's useful to acquire a few new habits.</p>

<p>First of all, every time you finish a drawing, quickly write down the <em>title</em>, <em>date</em>, and your <em>signature</em> somewhere in the corner. This allows you to keep track of your progress as an artist. Additionally, if you feel like it, leave comments at the back about what was difficult, or what you like or don't like about it in particular. You might think you're wasting your time, but you'll love yourself for doing it consistently later on.</p>

<p>Secondly, keep your tools clean and stored in a safe place that is easy to reach. Obviously, dirty tools hinder your drawing process, while tools that are hard to reach might make it difficult to motivate yourself to start a drawing.</p>

<p>Keep all your drawings stored together in some sort of map, so you can easily look through them to see how far you've come, or use them as reference when you're in doubt about how to execute some idea.</p>

<p>The most important thing to remember is that learning to draw is actually about two things: to <em>see</em> the world in a different way, and to <em>draw</em> what's on your mind. Both require lots of time and practice to evolve and strengthen. This might make it difficult for you to stay motivated, which is why I encourage looking at your progress from time to time, and doing lots of drawings without worrying about the outcome!</p>

  title: "[Drawing] The Laws of Drawing"
  post: "<p>What makes a drawing good? Why is it that some people can draw a beautiful panda in ten minutes, while others struggle to draw a realistic box in an hour? Well, a drawing is regarded as "good" when it is able to convey the information it wants to convey! If you want to draw a panda as your company's logo, you of course want that panda to be recognizable. In other words, you want people to see it and think: 'Hey, that is one good looking panda! Wait, isn't that the company X logo?'</p> 

<p>The keyword here is <strong>realism</strong>. You want your drawings to feel like they are real, like they are snapshots of a scene that is actually happening in front of the viewer's eyes. And in order to achieve this realism, we need to give our drawing <em>depth</em>. Our world is three dimensional, but our drawing has only two dimensions, which means we need some extra skill to create the illusion of that third dimension.</p>

<p>For this, I have what I call the 9 Laws of Drawing:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Contour Lines.</strong> Imagine your lines as curves wrapping around the form of a 3D object, not simply as two dimensional stripes.</li>
	<li><strong>Edges.</strong> Use the right type of edge to portray what you want.</li>
	<li><strong>Foreshortening</strong>. Distort shapes to create the illusion that they aren't flat.</li>
	<li><strong>Overlapping</strong>. Overlap shapes to show one is closer to the viewer than the other.</li>
	<li><strong>Construct.</strong> Use basic 3D shapes to construct your objects in a logical and realistic way.</li>
	<li><strong>Proportions</strong>. Use size and proportional relationships to show the position and form of an object.</li>
	<li><strong>Shading</strong>. Use light and shadow to show the form of a 3D object.</li>
	<li><strong>Perspective. </strong>Use the elements of perspective, such as horizon lines, placement up or down the page, and vanishing points.</li>
	<li><strong>Details.</strong> Use details---such as texture, colouring or density---to enrich the drawing even more.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DrawingLawsOfDrawing.png" /></p>

<p>These laws aren't placed in a random order; they are ordered from basic to advanced, and structured in the same way as this whole course. I'll start with teaching you to get simple lines and curves looking right, and then continue to shapes, which leads to 3D objects, which leads to adding enrichment and details. Essentially, last sentence already describes the whole <em>drawing process</em>. You've already learnt everything you need to know! Now all I need to do is use the rest of the course to show you how to do it. Yes, it's that simple.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Lines"
  post: "<p>Let's face it, everything you draw is essentially a line. It's not like you can create a three dimensional box by waving your pencil in the air. Because of that, it's only logical that your line making technique should be perfect.</p> 

<h2>Confident Lines</h2>

<p>Lots of beginning artists are afraid to draw. They draw short, sketchy strokes which should, after a while, resemble the line they were after. Of course, using the eraser can tidy up some things, but the process is slow and just not right. When you draw a line, you should be confident about it!</p>

<img src="media/DrawingConfidentLines.png" />

<p>When you know what line you want to draw, perform a swift pencil stroke to do so. Don't worry if it doesn't turn out alright, you can just erase the whole line and try again. Using this method you'll see immediate improvements in the quality of your lines, and after a while, you'll rarely draw a wrong line.</p>

<h2>Drawing from the Shoulder</h2>

<p>Write your name on a piece of paper. When you're done, ask yourself the questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What parts of my body were involved in writing this?</li>
	<li>Did I shift my position or hunch my back?</li>
</ul>

<p>Odds are, you primarily used your wrist for the writing and leaned forward a bit. For handwriting, this is okay, as you're making small controlled motions which should just resemble some letters. When drawing, this stiffness makes it hard to create smooth and natural lines. The solution is: drawing from your shoulder!</p>

<img src="media/DrawingFromTheShoulder.gif" />

<p>Instead of leaning on your hand and using only your wrist, lock your wrist and draw by rotating the <em>shoulder</em> and <em>elbow</em>. You'll notice that this feels out-of-control and unbalanced, at first. A good way to combat this feeling is by having a correct posture: sitting upright and with both feet firmly on the ground. If you're constantly shifting position, you'll have to adjust your drawing technique every time, which is wasteful. In the end, however, only practicing this drawing method a lot will make you accustomed to it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as illustrated by my handwriting example, you shouldn't always draw from your shoulder. This type of drawing is great for medium to large curves and lines, but when you want to draw small details and finishing touches, you should actually draw from the wrist. It gives you more control and stability in the small range that it gives you. A good drawing will often be a combination of the two: large and loose strokes, combined with small and detailed ones.</p>

<h2>Extended Lines</h2>

<p>Even after years of practice, you'll still occasionally have problems with drawing a line with the correct length in one try. Fortunately, we have an eraser! When drawing lines, it's sometimes helpful to "overshoot" the line. Just draw the line longer than it has to be, and later on erase the parts you don't need.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingOvershootingLines.png" />

<h2>Line Thickness</h2>

<p>There's one great tool built into every pencil that most people overlook. By varying the amount of pressure you put on it, you get thinner and thicker lines. Instead of creating all your lines at the exact same size, you can use the thickness of the line to make the drawing more dynamic. As a rule of thumb, thick lines are often used to show something is closer to the viewer or in the shadows.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingLineThickness.png" />

<h2>Rotate the Page!</h2>

<p>One last tip: if you find yourself having troubles with a certain line or curve, simply rotate the page until it becomes easier for you. Most people naturally draw smoother and easier when they're moving the pencil towards them, instead of away from their body.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>I recommend doing these exercises on a day to day basis, and as often as you can. They can also be used as a warmup, if you like.</p>

<h3>Straight Lines</h3>

<p>Let's start easy. Draw lines of any length and in any direction you want, as long as they are (mostly) straight. If you find your lines curving or having bumps in them, keep practicing! Nevertheless, keep your arm loose and focus on drawing smooth and fast lines.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingStraightLines.gif" />

<h3>Curved Lines</h3>

<p>Place dots at random positions on the paper. Now, connect all the dots by drawing a curved line through all of them. Make sure you don't take any sharp turns, keep everything smooth, and go through ever dot exactly.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingCurves.gif" />

<h3>Copying Lines</h3>

<p>Draw a random line. Now, copy the exact same line; continue trying to copy it until it looks almost identical.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingCopyingLines.gif" />

<h3>Doodle!</h3>

<p>This is the fun one. Doodle anything you like, it doesn't have to resemble anything or be pretty. Below is an example of something I just randomly doodled.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Edges"
  post: "<p>One of the biggest issues people have with drawing is that they don't know what lines they should and shouldn't draw. <em>Should I draw lines at every spot the object changes colour/texture?</em> <em>Or should I draw lines everywhere there's a change of shape? Or should I solely draw the outlines? </em>These questions have no definite answer, but a few approaches can be used.</p> 

<h2>Hard, Soft and Lost Edges</h2>

<p>We can identify three different types of edges: <strong>hard edges</strong>, <strong>soft edges</strong> and <strong>lost edges</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingEdgeTypes.png" /></p>

<p><em>Hard Edges</em> signal a sharp or sudden edge. For example, buildings often have lots of hard edges because of their "squaredness". Likewise, a line that separates one object from another is also hard, as you can't smoothly transition between two different objects.</p>

<p><em>Soft Edges</em> signal a subtle, smooth or curved edge. For example, wrinkles in clothes are soft edges as you can't really create sharp folds in cloth.</p>

<p><em>Lost Edges</em> are, well, edges that are lost. When two objects next to each other have (almost) the same colour, the edge between them disappears.</p>

<p>It's your job to determine the edges in your drawing, and most of all determine their type. Really, it comes down to personal choice</p>

<h2>Style</h2>

<p>Even though the course has just started, we've already reached a topic that hugely influences the style of your drawing.  Simple cartoons and comics, for example, usually have only hard edges. Realistic paintings, on the other hand, try to employ a lot of soft and lost edges for realism or artistic effect.</p>

<p>Besides personal choice, what you're going to use the drawing for also has an impact. If you're designing characters for a game, you can't use lost edges as the characters will be moving around, and you'll probably use hard edges to make the character stand out amongst all sorts of backgrounds. If you're creating a background drawing for a website, you'll want to use as little hard edges as possible, because it shouldn't scream for attention.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingEdgeStyle.png" /></p>

<p>In the end, you'll only learn to use edges well by experimenting and looking at art in the style you're after.</p>

<h2>A Different Approach</h2>

<p>If this seems vague to you, there's another approach I think is useful to know. Here it comes: <em>edges are lines shared by two shapes</em>. When trying to find your edges, look for shapes that are colliding. If they are radically different, there's a good chance it's a hard edge. It they are similar, there's a good chance you should go for a soft or lost edge. Next chapter will be all about shapes, and will hopefully clarify this statement of mine.</p>

<h2>Pointy Edges</h2>

<p>It's important to understand that hard edges are not equal to pointy edges, which are used for things such as spikes or knifes. You can't really draw such sharp points with one stroke, as you'll end up with a way to smooth corner. Instead, draw these points as two lines intersecting, and perhaps erase some of the thickness at the end.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingPointyEdges.gif" /></p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>To practice giving your lines more meaning, look at the images below, and draw each one of them two times.  The first time, copy the image exactly and identify the types of edges. The second time, change one edge to another type.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Shapes"
  post: "<p>When multiple lines intersect to create a closed area, we call it a <em>shape</em>. When you look at an image closely, you'll see that it's nothing more than a bunch of shapes forming a visual illusion. I'm not talking about objects or parts of objects, I'm only talking about pieces of a drawing that are visually different. A shadow, for example, is a shape as well, just as a highlight.</p> 

<p><img src="media/DrawingShapesAreEverything.png" /></p>

<h2>Drawing from Real Life</h2>

<p>If you (only) want to draw from real life, we're already done here. I only need to explain a few things about shapes and techniques, and you're good to go. I, however, think you want to be able to draw anything, not just copy some object that you put in front of you. The rest of the course is focussed solely on achieving that goal; drawing anything you can imagine. Nevertheless, the methods described here are still fundamental concepts that will probably be of some value to you.</p>

<p>There are two methods to draw from real life: <strong>contouring</strong> and <strong>block-in</strong>.</p>

<h3>Contouring</h3>

<p>This sounds the simplest, but actually is the hardest. Contouring simply means that you copy every shape you see directly to the paper. You don't need to know the structure behind the objects in your picture, or how shading works---you can see the shapes right in front of you, and you can just copy them.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingContouring.gif" /></p>

<h3>Block-in</h3>

<p>This method is a simplification of the contouring method. Instead of drawing objects shape by shape, you draw the shapes around it (at the edges of the paper), where <em>nothing happens</em>. When done carefully, these blocks reveal the shapes you were trying to draw. The more often you refine your blocks, the smoother your shapes will be.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingBlockIn.gif" /></p>

<h2>Positive &amp; Negative Shapes</h2>

<p>Broadly speaking, the world is a set of so-called <em>positive</em> and <em>negative</em> shapes, balancing each other. When you hold your pencil up in the air before your eyes, you see a pencil shape (obviously). Your focus is on the pencil, which is why it's called a positive shape. There is, however, something else you also (unconsciously) see: the space around the pencil. This space is mostly ignored by your brain, as it is blurred and empty, and therefore a negative shape.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingNegativeSpaces.png" /></p>

<p>The block-in method from last section already made great use of these negative shapes, and you should use them as well any time you notice their existence!</p>

<p>As you can see, positive shapes are surrounded by negative shapes; objects are surrounded by empty spaces without any object. When it comes to drawing, both of these shapes are important. To remember this distinction, it helps to know other names for negative spaces that are more descriptive: <em>trapped shapes</em> or <em>negative space</em>.</p>

<h2>The Four Rules of Shape</h2>

<p>It's possible that "just draw the shapes as you see them" is a bit overwhelming, which is why I would like to list the four rules of shape, which are always a good starting point.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Start Large</strong>. Draw large shapes first, then smaller shapes. Start with a general outline of each object, or maybe even a general outline of multiple objects at the same time. Squinting your eyes or rotating the image can help notice the largest of forms and shapes.</li>
	<li><strong>Enrich</strong>. Distinguish between those major shapes by adding details and shading. Look for shapes that enrich what you already have, such as highlights, shadows, reflections, patterns, or textures. All of these are also shapes by themselves, although not always as obvious or simple as you think shapes to be.</li>
	<li><strong>Connect. </strong>Tie shapes together to simplify the drawing, and make your life easier. You might think this adds to the confusion, but it actually greatly reduces it. Instead of adding all sorts of small scribbly lines and subtle tone differences, everything is unified and the viewer automatically interprets it the right way.</li>
	<li><strong>Think "Negative"</strong>. When you see a trapped shape, draw it. Trapped shapes inherently reveal the positive shapes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that points 2&mdash;4 are in no particular order. As illustrated with the drawing below, you can apply them in any way you like.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingRulesOfShape.png" /></p>

<h2>Imaginative Drawing</h2>

<p>Now that you've learnt all about drawing from real life, you're surely eager to know how you can draw anything that pops into your head. For this, the only method available is called <strong>construction</strong>. Simply put, everything can be constructed out of basic shapes, which are <em>rectangles</em> and <em>ovals</em>. And, of course, all sorts of variations on those (ellipses, trapezoids, egg-like shapes, etcetera). Next chapters will tell you all about those!</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingFromImagination.png" /></p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>After such a general and abstract chapter, there aren't really exercises to be done. All I can say is: if you have the time, find an interesting object, and try drawing it using the methods I provided. Especially try to see and draw the negative shapes. Go wild!</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Rectangles"
  post: "<p>The obvious first basic shape, is the rectangle. I, however, will use this name to refer to any shape that has four edges, to keep terminology simple.</p> 

<h2>A Standard Rectangle</h2>

<p>Drawing a regular rectangle is simple. Draw two vertical lines next to each other, and two horizontal lines underneath each other, and voila. Again, the overshooting technique I taught you is useful to get smooth lines.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingRegularRectangles.png" />

<h2>Rectangles in Perspective</h2>

<p>But, how often do you see such perfect rectangles in real life? Not often. Only when you look at rectangular objects in perfect side view, you actually see a rectangle. If you look at objects from an angle, the shapes will be distorted, which we call <em>foreshortening</em>. The reason for this is simply that things that are further away seem smaller, even though the sides of the rectangle are essentially of the same size in (three dimensional space).</p>

<p>In a rectangle, the vertical lines are parallel to each other (they have the same direction), and the horizontal lines as well. Foreshortened rectangles have at least one pair of parallel lines moving towards each other, depending on the perspective you choose. Essentially, this means that the parts of the rectangle that are further away should be smaller.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingForeshortenedRectangles.png" />

<h2>Contour Lines</h2>

<p>The first law of drawing talked about contour lines; the lines wrapping around an object that showcase the three-dimensional form. With rectangles, it might seem obvious that the contour lines are nothing more than even more parallel lines within the rectangle. In perspective, however, it's difficult to establish direction and position of contour lines from the top of your head. To solve this, there is a method called <em>dividing rectangles</em>.</p>

<p>Simply put, the two main diagonals of any rectangle intersect at its centre point, and basically subdivide the rectangle into four smaller ones. With these you can perform the same technique until you have the precision you need. The best thing about it is that it works for any shape, even in perspective!</p>

<img src="media/DrawingDividingRectangles.gif" />

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>The exercises for this are simple ones I recommend you try to do every day as a warm-up.</p>

<h3>Any Rectangle</h3>

<p>Draw rectangles at different sizes. Try to create a square once in a while. If you feel adventurous, try to draw rotated rectangles as well.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingAnyRectangleExercise.gif" />

<h3>Perspective Rectangles</h3>

<p>Draw a random foreshortened rectangle, and subdivide it once.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingForeshortenedRectangleExercise.gif" />

<h3>Houses</h3>

<p>Draw houses or churches, just like you used to do when you were young (probably). Try to use subdivision and foreshortening to add windows or other details.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Ovals"
  post: "<p>I called this chapter ovals, and not circles, because drawing a perfect circles is actually rarely required in a drawing. Just as with rectangles, you'll encounter lots of distorted and modified ovals when trying to draw 3D.</p> 

<h2>Circles</h2>

<p>A perfect circle takes time to get right, even when drawing from the shoulder. Small circles are okay, but if you need large ones it's best to just draw a quick and loose oval, and later on use the eraser and small strokes here and there to adjust it. I have to say, though, that organic shapes that <em>seem</em> circular (such as the head) are often slightly stretched circles, or egg-like shapes. Try to look closely at your object to see how it actually looks.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingPerfectCircles.png" />

<h2>Ellipses</h2>

<p>Ellipses are <em>incredibly</em> important when drawing, and the annoying thing is that they're the hardest to get right. Ellipses are the only way to represent <em>foreshortened circles</em>. I think the best way to learn to control them, is by knowing some basic theory about ellipses. This picture sums it up:</p>

<img src="media/DrawingEllipseTheory.png" />

<p>The degree is named that way for a good reason. It represents the angle at which we look at the circle; for example, a large degree means the ellipse is a circle, and we're looking at it in perfect side view. A small degree means we're looking from a large angle, and we see a hugely foreshortened circle.</p>

<p>To illustrate this further, we can draw a circle <em>within a rectangle</em>, and then rotate the rectangle (using our knowledge from last chapter). Notice how the circle becomes an ellipse with decreasing degree.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingForeshortenedCircles.png" />

<h2>Contour Lines</h2>

<p>Just as with rectangles, we can subdivide our ovals into multiple parts. Again, the easiest way to accomplish this is by drawing a rectangle around it, and subdividing that. The point where they intersect is the centre point of the oval, and you should have a circle with 8 equally big parts.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingDividingCircles.gif" />

<p>Now, these contour lines help you to draw a pie, but don't seem to have much more use than that. However, if we relate these contour lines of the flat oval shape to a 3D object, we can easily create the visual illusion of depth and form. I call this the <strong>umbrella method</strong>.</p>

<p>All you do is draw a subdivided circle---or only part of it, if you don't need all of it---underneath  your object, and then draw straight strokes from the subdivision lines to the object, to see where your contour lines should be on your object. (Don't worry, we'll take a closer look at contour lines in later chapters when we're actually working with 3D objects)</p>

<img src="media/DrawingUmbrellaMethod.gif" />

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>Again, simple exercises I suggest you do daily, or whenever you have some time to kill.</p>

<h3>Ovals</h3>

<p>Draw ovals at different sizes. They don't have to be perfect. Try to keep the ovals smooth, and especially try to end the line exactly where you started.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingOvalsExercise.gif" />

<h3>Circles &amp; Ellipses</h3>

<p>Last exercise was a loose one, with this exercise you try to draw perfect circles and ellipses at all angles/sizes.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingCirclesEllipsesExercise.gif" />

<h3>Tracing Shapes</h3>

<p>Simply draw any of the shapes from the previous exercises. Now, trace over that exact shape again and again. Start slow, but aim to trace your shapes as fast as possible.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingTracingShapesExercise.gif" />

<h3>Combine</h3>

<p>Draw anything that combines all the previously discussed shapes. Especially useful, I think, is to draw ovals inside rectangles, or vice versa.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Construction & Form"
  post: "<p>Now that you can draw the most important shapes, it's time to dig a little deeper into that <em>construction</em> method. I already told you that you can use basic shapes to construct <em>anything</em>, but how do you know which shapes to use and where to place them?</p> 

<p>Well, that can be accomplished by constructing your objects out of actual 3D shapes! Instead of trying to magically figure out the shapes of an object, you can build it out of basic shapes---such as cubes, spheres and cylinders---and use that as a very useful guide. When I refer to the actual three-dimensional construction of an object, I'll use the term <strong>form</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingFormBasicShapes.png" /></p>

<p>When you see an object, you only see its outside, and not what is on the inside. This, however, is quite deceptive; how the object is constructed from the inside is what actually determines how it looks to our eyes. By learning to build your objects from the inside to the outside, you learn to understand its form, <em>and</em> you're able to draw it in any way you like.</p>

> <strong>Laws of Form #1: </strong>Learn to recognize and draw the 3D basic shapes: cubes, circles, cylinders, pyramids and cones.

<h2>Pose</h2>

<p>An object with the same form, can have multiple <strong>poses</strong>. A human can sit in many different poses, but it stays the same human with the exact same body. That human is able to do so because multiple parts of his body are connected at so-called <em>joints</em> (that can rotate freely, to some extent).</p>

> <strong>Laws of Form #2: </strong>Find out where the joints are, and how they connect two parts of the object

<p><img src="media/DrawingPoses.png" /></p>

<p>The important things to remember is that joints can be hinge-like, such as the elbow that connects upper arm and lower arm, as well as fixed, such as screwing a leg to a chair's sitting surface.</p>

<p>In this case, I use the word <em>pose</em> in a general sense: it doesn't only apply to humans or living things, but also to lifeless objects. For example, a building can be in different states as well (windows can be opened, curtains can be closed), but in general lifeless objects are more static and drawing basic shapes is often enough to understand them.</p>

<h2>Gesture &amp; Rhythm</h2>

<p>Most poses have a general action, direction or movement within them, which I call the <em>gesture</em> or <em>rhythm</em>. If you don't know where to start, it's always wise to lay down the basic gesture. For example, if you're drawing a human, a simple vertical curve already establishes that the human is standing up. If you're drawing a tree blowing in the wind, a simple diagonal curve establishes the gesture you can then work on.</p>

> <strong>Laws of Form #3:</strong> Before anything else, loosely sketch the gesture of your object.

<p><img src="media/DrawingGesture.png" /></p>

<h2>Contour Lines</h2>

<p>The only problem with basic shapes, is that they're quite static. A panda's upper body can be approximated with a cylinder---but it doesn't actually look anything like a cylinder! Once you laid out the basic shapes, it's time to modify them and add details to improve the realism of your drawing.</p>

<p>The best way to reliably do so, is to subdivide your basic shapes and add contour lines here and there. In the previous chapters I've already discussed how to subdivide shapes, while drawing contour lines in 3D will be dealt with in the next chapters. By adding these contour lines, you can really see how the form flows, and you can make adjustments <em>in accordance with</em> those lines. If you were to modify a basic shape in a completely different flow than the contour lines, it would look odd.</p>

> <strong>Laws of Form #4:</strong> Modify basic shapes to increase realism, and use contour lines to aid this process.

<p><img src="media/DrawingFormContourLines.png" /></p>

<h2>Balance</h2>

<p>Last but not least, a quick tip for you. If an object is not falling over, it's <em>balanced</em>. Therefore, if you're drawing something that shouldn't fall over, you should make sure the balance is right. For example, if you look at your drawing and see that your character is slightly leaning to the left, while he should just be standing perfectly straight, this would look weird. If you, however, move his left foot outward, he regains balance and the way your drew him is just a pose you gave him. Always try to find out what your object leans on, and where the centre of mass (approximately) is, and use this information to make the pose balanced.</p>

> <strong>Laws of Form #5:</strong> If your object isn't falling over, make sure it's balanced. If your object actually <em>is</em> falling over, or you want a surrealistic effect, reduce balance on purpose.

  title: "[Drawing] Cubes"
  post: "<p>Things in our world tend to be very cube-like. Our buildings are approximately cubes, our vehicles are approximately cubes, and the list goes on and on. Fortunately, the cube is the easiest basic shape to draw in perspective!</p> 

<h2>What's a Cube?</h2>

<p>Technically, a cube is a three-dimensional square, but I will use it as a term for boxes of any size, just as I used <em>rectangle</em> for all shapes with four corners. A cube is what happens when you add depth to a rectangle, and essentially extend it in the z-direction. Cubes can be found nearly everywhere, and are often a good way to establish the overall form of objects before adding in the details.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingCubesOverview.png" />

<h2>Cubes in Perspective</h2>

<p>Because a cube is just a set of rectangles, we can use foreshortened rectangles to make it look nice in perspective. Because we can never see more than three sides of a cube---if you disagree, check for yourself---we only need (at most) three <em>vanishing points</em>. I already told you that parallel lines angle towards each other in perspective, and the reason for this is that parallel lines converge or intersect at those so-called vanishing points. They are nothing more than imaginary points somewhere in the distance where two parallel lines would eventually meet. You often don't even need to know their exact position, as an approximation is enough to create accurate cubes.</p>

<p>So, when drawing a cube, simply establish the vanishing points and draw lines from them, and you're done!</p>

<img src="media/DrawingCubesThreePoints.png" />

<p>As you can see in the image, if you choose your vanishing points too close to your object, you get a very distorted perspective, which often isn't realistic at all. Something you perhaps also noticed, is that the three vanishing points always form a nice triangle. After you've chosen two vanishing points (which shouldn't be too close to each other), the third one should be at an equal distance from both points.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you're wondering <em>why</em> parallel lines converge, think about looking down from a very high spot, such as a mountain. Below you can see the houses and maybe even people, but they are nothing more than dots to your eyes. Because they are so far away, their shapes converge towards a single point (from your point of view). More will be explained in the chapter on perspective.</p>

<h2>Viewing Angles</h2>

<p>You probably noticed that I said you needed <em>at most</em> three vanishing points. You can remove one vanishing point, which means that parallel lines in that direction simply stay parallel. In this case, you'll only see two sides of the cube. In fact, sometimes a cube even requires only a single vanishing point. To understand when or why this is the case, I need to talk about viewing angles.</p>

<p>There are three dimensions in which you can rotate, which I'll call <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> and <em>z</em>. You may also call them <em>width</em>, <em>height</em>, and <em>depth</em> if you like. Not only can we rotate other objects in these directions, we can also tilt our own head and by doing so change the <em>viewing angle</em> at which we see the world.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingCubesViewingAngles.png" />

<p>Essentially, when one of our viewing angles aligns with one of the cube's angles, we have only one or two vanishing points. When all viewing angles are aligned, there are no vanishing points; the cube has become a flat rectangle to our eyes. When none of our viewing angles are aligned, we get the three vanishing points again.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingCubesViewingAnglesAligning.png" />

<h2>Contour Lines</h2>

<p>Because I already took the time to explain to you how to divide rectangles, drawing contour lines on cubes is easypeasy. Cubes have only flat sides, which means you can simply draw the individual contour lines for each rectangle shape, and you should be good.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingCubesContourLines.png" />

<p>If you're wondering---"<em>what are those contour lines good for?"</em>---just think about how often shapes in the real world are cubes with holes in them or certain parts extruded. If you want to accurately morph your cube into the actual shape you were looking for, you need the contour lines to show you how the surface wraps in perspective.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingCubesModified.png" />

<h2>Drawing Through</h2>

<p>One last tip I have for you is applicable to all (basic) shapes really, and especially useful if you need to draw the interior of an object (like, for example, what's inside a box) or a transparent object. The technique is called <strong>drawing through</strong>, and it means that you draw the lines at the other side of the shape, even though you're not actually going to see them all. This helps build an understanding of how an object is build, and makes it even easier for you to add details.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingCubesInside.png" />

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>These exercises will generally take a bit longer than the previous ones, but I still suggest you practice drawing your cubes every day.</p>

<h3>Simple Cubes</h3>

<p>Place four dots on the paper, making sure that two of them are on the same horizontal line, and the other two on the same vertical line. Connect them with lines to get a hugely distorted rectangle, which represents the top of the cube. Now draw the rest of the cube.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingSimpleCubesExercise.gif" />

<p>NOTE: This is kind of the reversed way of drawing a cube. First, you draw the division lines, and then you use them to create your foreshortened rectangles.</p>

<h3>Advanced Cubes</h3>

<p>Place one, two or three random vanishing points on the paper. Now draw the cube that results from them.</p>

<img src="media/DrawingCubesThreePointsExercise.gif" />

<h3>Connecting Cubes</h3>

<p>Draw a random cube. Now divide all the sides, and connect a smaller cube to one of the subdivisions. This one takes some practice, but is extremely useful. Once you get better, start adding more and more cubes, and maybe even some variations.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Spheres"
  post: "<p>When it comes to organic forms, such as animals or trees, the sphere is a very important tool. Drawing a sphere, however, might be one of the hardest things to do for beginning artists. The combination of drawing a perfect circle and trying to make it look 3D is more often than not a challenge. Fortunately, I've already explained how circles and ellipses work, which should make things a lot easier!</p> 

<h2>What's a Sphere?</h2>

<p>A sphere is just a ball. Earth is a sphere, just as a wheel, orange or tennis ball. Technically, a sphere is what happens when you add together three different circles; one in each main direction (the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> axes, remember?). Even though spheres look <em>exactly the same</em> from any angle, it's important to understand how they are constructed, for both contour lines and drawing special spheres.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingSpheres.png" /></p>

<h2>Special Spheres?</h2>

<p>Yes, special spheres. The sphere is a three-dimensional circle, which means it is equally large in all dimensions. But, what if we want to stretch or shrink the sphere in certain directions? (Think of, for example, a kiwi.) Then we'd get a <em>spheroid</em>!</p>

<p>These may seem difficult at first, as they <em>do</em> change their shape when you look from different angles. But, if you just draw the three ellipses that make up this spheroid, and then connect the ends with a nice curve, you should be fine.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingSpheroids.png" /></p>

<p>NOTE: As you see in the picture, spheroids take on a shape <em>similar to</em> the ellipse in perspective. The main difference in most of the cases, is that this ellipse has much longer flat sides.</p>

<h2>Contour Lines</h2>

<p>Because spheres (usually) don't have hard edges, using the contour lines of a sphere is often the only way to show its three dimensional form. The other alternative is using shading as a soft edge, but more on that later. Additionally, contour lines can be used to establish the direction in which the circle is rotated; this is useful, for instance, when drawing a head looking in a certain direction.</p>

<p>To draw the contour lines, draw multiple ellipses of decreasing degree along the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> axis. Essentially, these divide the shape just like with rectangles, but this time we're using curves instead of diagonals. For a standard sphere, these ellipses would be pointed in the vertical and horizontal direction. If your sphere is rotated, these "constructive ellipses" turn with it.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingSphereContourLines.png" /></p>

<p>NOTE: The <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> axis are always perpendicular, so your ellipses should be as well.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>Just like the cube, try to do these as often as you can.</p>

<h3>Simple Spheres</h3>

<p>Draw a sphere, and add contour lines to it.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingSpheresExercise.gif" /></p>

<h3>Special Spheres</h3>

<p>Draw a spheroid. If you're having trouble, start with perfect side view, as it's much easier to do.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingSpheroidsExercise.gif" /></p>

<h3>Orienting Spheres</h3>

<p>Draw a sphere, and use the contour lines to make it face the direction you want. If you want, add simple eyes (and nose) to make it into a face.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Cylinders"
  post: "<p>Let me tell you a secret. The favourite basic shape of the world is not the cube nor the sphere &hellip; but a combination of both! The cylinder can be found everywhere, and is often an even better shape to approximate form, than a cube. A tree trunk is a bunch of cylinders, as well as its branches. The human body is best approximated with a cylinder, as well as most animal spines. Really, they're everywhere.</p> 

<h2>What's a Cylinder?</h2>

<p>A cylinder is what happens when you add depth to a circle, or extend a circle in the z-direction. The top and bottom sides are flat circles, and in between those is a tube connecting them. It's basically a bunch of flat circles stacked on top of each other. Not surprisingly, for the top/bottom we can use ellipses, and we can use straight lines for the part in between.</p>

<h2>Cylinders in Perspective</h2>

<p>If you're not looking at cylinders in perfect side view, you need to keep a close eye on the rules of perspective, or your cylinders will look odd. As usual, the straight lines should converge into the distance. This automatically leads to the fact that the side that is furthest away should be represented by a smaller ellipse than the side close to the viewer. Nevertheless, it's important to make a distinction here between the <em>size</em> of an ellipse and its <em>degree</em> (or <em>width</em>).</p>

<p>Because the other side is further away, it's smaller; we learned that from cubes and vanishing points. But, because of its different position, we're looking at it at another angle, so the degree should be greater. I hope the image clarifies this more.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingCylindersInPerspective.png" /></p>

<h2>Putting Cylinders in Boxes</h2>

<p>If you're using a really tricky perspective, or you have trouble with cylinders in general, there's always the option of drawing a cube around it. Simply draw your cube like you normally would, nothing fancy, but make sure to <em>draw through</em> it. This means that you draw the lines at the back, which you normally don't see, as well. Now you can use the front and back face of the cube to draw the ellipses that transform it into a cylinder.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingCylindersInBoxes.png" /></p>

<p>You've probably noticed that some of my ellipses are rotated, and that's good, because it is very important! We've thus far only used vanishing points as great guidelines for drawing rectangular shapes, but we can also use them for ellipses and circular shapes. All you need to do is make sure that the <em>minor axis</em> converges at the vanishing point as well.</p>

<h2>Contour Lines</h2>

<p>The contour lines for the cylinder are somewhat complicated. In one direction, we have nothing but straight lines. In the other direction, we have nothing but ellipses wrapping around the curvy side of the cylinder. Together, all these lines form a nice grid for you to see how the form of your cylinder works.</p>

<p>Just as with constructing spheres, it's important to change the degree of the ellipse when moving in three-dimensional space.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingContouredCylinders.png" /></p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>Not surprisingly, these exercises should also be done as often as possible.</p>

<h3>Simple Cylinders</h3>

<p>Draw a cylinder in side view. This means that all you need is two ellipses parallel to each other, and two lines connecting them.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingSimpleCylindersExercise.gif" /></p>

<h3>Advanced Cylinders</h3>

<p>Draw a cube, using one, two or three vanishing points (whatever you like). Now draw the cylinder inside it.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingCylindersPerspectiveExercise.gif" /></p>

<h3>Cylinders with Connections</h3>

<p>This one is hard. Draw a cylinder, and add the contour lines. Now, at random spots, connect cubes or other cylinders to it. Make sure to follow those contour lines, and don't forget the rules of perspective on the shapes you connect to it! When in doubt, check the tree in the image at the start of this chapter; it makes heavy use of (distorted) cylinders.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Pyramids & Cones"
  post: "<p>Now that we've discussed the biggest and most important forms of all---cubes, spheres and cylinders---it's time to look at the last two basic shapes, which are much simpler and less common. Nevertheless, they certainly have their place in the world of drawing.</p> 

<h2>Pyramids</h2>

<p>A pyramid is a cube, but with one side collapsed into a single point. Therefore, to draw a pyramid, is to draw a cube and then replace one side for its midpoint. Again and again, the concept of dividing rectangles comes into play.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingPyramids.png" /></p>

<p>Of course, pyramids don't necessarily have to have equally large sides. You can pick any point on a side and use it as the pyramid's sharp point, but there's no quick way to determine what point to use in a certain perspective. This one's up to your intuition, I think</p>

<h2>Pyramid Contour Lines</h2>

<p>A pyramid's contour lines are rather simple. If we regard the bottom of the pyramid, which is a rectangle, as the <em>base</em>, the contour lines are straight lines parallel to the base lines.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingContouredPyramids.png" /></p>

<h2>Cones</h2>

<p>A cone is a cylinder, but with one of the circular sides collapsed into a single point. Just as with the pyramid, drawing a cone means drawing a cylinder and then replacing one side by a single point.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingCones.png" /></p>

<h2>Cones Contour Lines</h2>

<p>If we, again, regard the bottom of the cone as the <em>base</em>, the contour lines are ellipses parallel to the base. Make sure to slightly change the degree with every new ellipse</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingContouredCones.png" /></p>

<h2>Where do I find Pyramids and Cones?</h2>

<p>Pyramids are often found next to cubes, as the nice pointy top makes things look finished and polished. For example, most houses have pyramid-like roofs.</p>

<p>Cones are often found next to cylinders, for the same reason. For example, a cylindrical building (such as a tower) will have a cone as a roof.</p>

<p>But more often than not, these shapes are found in the tiny details. You'll rarely find objects that are largely pyramids or cones, but you'll often find that the smaller shapes in a drawing are best approximated with these basic shapes.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>Because pyramids and cones can be directly created out of cubes and cylinders, I don't really have any new fundamental exercises to give you. Just try to transform a basic shape into a pyramid or cone once in a while when you do the other exercises.</p>

<h3>Drawing Cities</h3>

<p>Obviously, drawing a city scene is a fun way to practice cubes + pyramids and cylinders + cones. It doesn't have to be pretty, creative or detailed---just try to get lots of different buildings on the paper with proper perspective.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Intersections & Organic Forms"
  post: "<p>Before we go into the last phase of the drawing process---which is enrichment and detailing---I want to talk about how to actually use these basic shapes to get the pretty pictures you want. The shapes themselves are quite static and not usually how they are seen in the real world. Instead, every object is a combination of the basic shapes, with most of them modified or distorted. To understand how multiple basic shapes can be combined or transformed, it's important to practice with <em>intersections</em>.</p> 

<p>Simply put, we're going to examine what happens when we add or subtract basic shapes from each other. By doing so, we learn three things: how to draw basic shapes, how to understand their form in three dimensional space, and how to modify them to get what we want.</p>

<p>To start off, draw a cube. Now, draw a sphere through it. These two basic shapes are now intersecting, each hiding a part of the other at several points. This means that we can draw lines that show when the cube turns into the sphere, and vice versa. This sounds hard, and it kind of is, but if you use contour lines and try to imagine these shapes you drew as if they actually had depth, you should be able to find out how the intersection flows.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingIntersectionsAdding.png" /></p>

<p>Now that we know how the two shapes interact, we can subtract one from the other. We could cut a spherical hole in the cube, or take a part in the form of a cube out of the sphere. Because we know the construction of these basic shapes so well, it has suddenly become much easier to create complex forms, simply by subtracting basic shapes from each other.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingIntersectionsSubtracting.png" /></p>

<p>This might still sound vague or complicated to you, and I'm afraid there's no way around it. You'll need to practice your intersections as often as you can, in order to understand how to get 3D objects on a 2D paper. But hey, once you get the hang of it, the possibilities are endless! All I can do now is give you some examples of intersections. Also, don't forget to try intersections with more than two shapes, if you feel confident.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingIntersectionsExamples.png" /></p>

<h2>Holes</h2>

<p>A very simplified version of those subtractions, is punching holes in an object. If you want, you can try practicing these first. All you do is draw the shape of the hole (circle, square, triangle, whatever) in perspective on the object's surface. Then, you draw the same shape a bit into the object, as if you were actually drilling a hole. Remove the lines you shouldn't be able to see, and you got yourself a hole!</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingIntersectionsHoles.png" /></p>

<h2>Organic Forms</h2>

<p>Besides static or rigid shapes, there are also forms that are fluid and flexible. A building will not bend when the wind blows against it, but a tree will. A ring won't change shape when you drop it, but a rubber band will. These organic forms are beautiful when executed the right way, but they're also the hardest to draw.</p>

<p>I think the best way to get a sense of how these forms interact with the world around it, is by identifying the <em>forces</em> that act upon it. The most obvious one is of course gravity, but things such as wind or someone pushing against the object are also common. Identify the direction of the force, and the places where it hits the object, to know what parts you should move and in what way.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingOrganicForms.png" /></p>

<p>Throughout this course I've already used ellipses here and there to give something a solid and organic form, and you can see in the picture that it's a wise thing to do for anything organic. Ellipses give an object depth and thickness, but also show that the object is round and curved.</p>

<p>Again, learn this skill all comes down to practice and observing the world around you. I think the simplest exercise is to draw random "blobby shapes" and dropping them on top of each other. This forces them to interact with each other in all sorts of ways. Keep in mind that the forms should retain their thickness, even when they are stretched and distorted a lot.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Detailing & Enrichment"
  post: "<p>Congratulations on making it this far! Up until now you've learned to draw smooth lines and curves, and how to turn them into shapes that resemble three-dimensional objects. When you're done with that, your drawing will still look unrealistic and probably a bit boring as well. Therefore, the last phase of any drawing should be used (in general) for the following three things:</p> 

<ul>
	<li>Perfecting every line and curve. Even the slightest of alterations can have a big impact, so go over everything once again and check if all lines are how you want them to be.</li>
	<li>Getting the overall perspective and proportions right. Not only every individual object must be good, the relationships between them also need to look realistic.</li>
	<li>Filling in the shapes. You can fill every shape with a single uniform colour, but using texture and shading on top of that often really makes a drawing stand out.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DrawingDetailingEnrichment.png" /></p>

<p>Next chapters will discuss all these topics. They are a bit longer and more theoretical than usual, but that's only because these are such big topics. I've narrowed them down quite a bit, but I really want you to understand <em>why</em> something is a certain way, and not just <em>how</em> you draw something in specific cases.</p>

<p>After that, the course will wrap up with some tips about imagination, creativity and the right mind-set for the drawing process. The conclusion will remind you of what you learned, and provide ideas and other courses to further improve your graphical skills!</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Proportions"
  post: "<p>Proportions determine a large part of your drawing, but are often what is wrong in beginner's drawings. For example, people see a human body and then try to draw it on paper, but the arms and legs are way too long or short. Or people forget that objects further away look much smaller. An eye trained to see proportions helps a great deal, but most of the time the solution is actually just (loosely) <em>measuring</em> things.</p> 

<p>Note that the tips and tricks laid out here are mostly useful when you're drawing from real life or something you can actually see. If you're drawing from imagination, however, I encourage you to use reference photographs, and apply these methods to those.</p>

<h2>The Basic Unit</h2>

<p>When measuring, we want to prevent ourselves from thinking in words like centimetres or inches. We want to use the visual side of our brain, instead of the logical side. Instead, we want to determine proportions <em>in relation to each other</em>. The first line we draw has to be an educated guess, but from that moment on we can bring every part of the drawing in relation to this first line. We like to call this the <strong>basic unit</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingProportionsBasicUnit.png" /></p>

<p>To apply the method, find a medium-sized, prominent line within your drawing. Draw this line on the paper at (approximately) the right position, and at a size you choose yourself. Do keep in mind, however, that you don't pick a size too large or small---otherwise the rest of the drawing won't fit. From now on, this line is your basic unit, and you can use it as a reference for everything else that you draw.</p>

<p>To do so, you need to know how often your basic unit fits into what you want to draw <em>in the real world</em> (not in your drawing). This ratio between the size of two lines in the real world is what we call a proportion, and it should stay the same in your drawing. If your basic unit is half the length of another line in the real world, it should be half the length of that other line in your drawing.</p>

<h2>Pencil Measuring</h2>

<p>To measure something in terms of the basic unit, we apply a method called <strong>pencil measuring</strong>. Pick up your pencil, and hold it in the direction of the line you want to draw. Stretch your arm and lock your elbow, and hold the pencil in front of you at eye level. Now you should be able to line up the pencil with what you want to draw, by placing the pencil point over the start of the line you want to draw. Then, use your thumb to mark the end of this line on the pencil, and there you have your measurement!</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingProportionsPencilMeasuring.png" /></p>

<p>If you don't want to re-measure your basic unit over and over, it's wise to draw a line on some other piece of sketching paper that marks the length of the basic unit. That way it's easy to see the proportion of a new line; simply compare the measurement you marked on the pencil with the line on the sketching paper. Ultimately, the result of this process should be something like 'this line is two and a half times as long as my basic unit'.</p>

<h2>The Midpoint Method</h2>

<p>Questions may arise now, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>How do I choose a suitable placement and scale for my basic unit?</em></li>
	<li><em>How do I measure the right angles for my lines?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Well, there's a solution for that: the<strong> midpoint method</strong>!</p>

<p>Before you start a drawing, actually get yourself a ruler and measure the paper you're going to work on. Draw a horizontal line and vertical line through the centre. We'll call these your axes, as the horizontal line is like an x-axis, and the vertical line like an y-axis. (Now get rid of the ruler.)</p>

<p>The point where these lines intersect, is the midpoint, and it's often not where you expect it. Objects in perspective often mess with our sense of balance, and place the midpoint somewhere else in our minds. If you have a dot on paper that clearly states the midpoint, you can use that as a good reference for where you should place objects in the centre of your view. Additionally, it's wise to choose a basic unit very close to it.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingProportionsMidpointMethod.png" /></p>

<p>The other advantage, is that you now have two axes with right (90 degree) angles. When you want to find the angle of a line, simply estimate it against the axis that's closest to it. Again, it helps to keep the pencil in front of your eyes (horizontally or vertically, whatever fits best) to clearly see the angle in relation to your main axes.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingProportionsMeasuringAngles.png" /></p>

<h2>Measuring Methods</h2>

<p>Knowing these methods will solve most of your problems. To finish things, I'll give some last guidelines.</p>

<h3>Foreshorten</h3>

<p>The more you see the end view of something, the less you see of its sides. If you view a cube from perfect front view, you only see one face and no other sides at all. But if you view a cube at a slight angle, you'll see parts of lots of sides. Most objects are viewed in such foreshortened ways, which influence the proportions. The important thing is that you draw what you see, instead of what you think should be true. Measure the length of the cube's lines when in doubt, instead of thinking 'well it's a cube, so all sides should be the same length'.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingProportionsForeshortening.png" /></p>

<h3>Measure Critically</h3>

<p>Most of the methods I described are not really precise---they are estimations and guesses, but come close enough to be just right for your drawing. If, however, accuracy is essential, you should take more time to do multiple and more precise measurements.</p>

<h3>Intensify</h3>

<p>By actively drawing the objects in the wrong proportion, you can show your feelings towards that certain object, or change how much attention it gets. A visibly enlarged object seems to be more important, while a shrunk object seems shy and unimportant.</p>

<h3>Plumb &amp; Level</h3>

<p>A more general way to achieve the right proportions, is the <strong>Plumb and Level</strong> method. By holding your pencil either vertically or horizontally, you can find lines that align with other lines. Put another way, you can find pieces of your drawing that should end up sitting on the same imaginary line as another piece, making it easier to get your proportions right. For example, a man's thumb and big toe might line up (vertically), or both of his shoulders line up (horizontally).</p>

<p>Not only does it help with placement and sizing of seemingly unrelated objects all over the drawing, but it also provides clues to the action of the pose. If, instead, a man's thumb and knee cap line up horizontally, you know he's not standing up straight.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Light"
  post: "<p>Without light we'd see, well, nothing. We wouldn't be able to distinguish between objects, or even get a general sense of our surroundings. The reason for this, is that light creates shadows, and shadows help us define the world around is. Therefore, to give your drawing more depth and realism, it's necessary to know where light is coming from and how it interacts with your objects. As we already saw with spheres at the beginning, shadows or highlights can show the curviness of an object without drawing the lines, but they can also be used to separate one object (or part of an object) from the other.</p> 

<p>When you look at a photograph of a single object, it's not hard to see where the shadows are. But, when things get more complicated, and you have to find the shadows yourself, it might be hard to draw everything correctly. To solve this problem, we need to understand (parts of) the theory behind lights and shadows. Do note though that it's actually very intuitive, and you shouldn't be thinking about it or 'calculating' that much when working with shadows---with time, it comes quickly and naturally.</p>

<h2>Light Sources</h2>

<p>The first thing to do when starting with shading, is to establish your <strong>light source</strong>; the main light that illuminates your scene. Of course, there's often more than a single light, which means the process I'm about to explain needs to be repeated for every source. What's important to remember, is that lights can only make things <em>lighter</em>. When the first light casts a certain shadow on the ground, the second light will never make that shadow darker. Instead, if the light is able to reach that spot, it will make the shadow lighter and/or the shadow area smaller. This property of light makes it easy to combine multiple sources; all you need to do for every light is find which shadows should be made lighter or disappear entirely.</p>

<p>Every light source has four properties that are of interest to us:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Position</strong>: The placement of the light in the 3D world.</li>
	<li><strong>Colour</strong>: The colour of the light. Sunlight, for example, is actually near white, while old light bulbs are more yellowy.</li>
	<li><strong>Strength</strong>: How strong the light is. Sunlight is very strong, while a dimmed light (obviously) isn't.</li>
	<li><strong>Type</strong>: The type of light. The most common type is a <em>round light </em>or <em>point light</em>, which means light is emitted in all directions. But, for example, a <em>spot light</em> has a certain direction and shape in which it emits light.</li>
</ul>

<p>It helps to mark the position of each light source on your paper with a large dot. Additionally, write down the properties of each light on a separate piece of paper, in case you forget.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingLightSources.png" /></p>

<h2>The Four Types of Shading</h2>

<p>Shadows are a direct consequence of light; where there's light, there's shadows. On the other hand, these shadows inherently reveal spots where light does hit the object and illuminates it. I will group both shadows and lights under the term <strong>shading</strong>. Shadows and highlights, however, can take on different shapes, position and colour. To know what to do, a distinction is made between four shading types:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Highlights</strong>: The place where a light hits an object directly has no shadow at all. This means that, compared with the rest of the drawing, it's a bright highlight. You can see that shadows aren't only dark and moody---they allow us to see the highlights as well.</li>
	<li><strong>Reflected Light</strong>: When light hits an object, it's reflected. Usually, this means that a small and soft highlight appears on nearby objects, but very reflective materials of course produce much brighter reflected lights. They are often forgotten, but are actually very important in establishing the relationships between different objects in space.</li>
	<li><strong>Crest Shadow </strong>(or <em>form shadow</em>): Shadow on an object itself that marks its shape(s) or form. These are gradual, such as the shadow on the sphere that marks its roundness.</li>
	<li><strong>Cast Shadow</strong>: Shadow cast by an object on other objects. When you place something between an object and the light source, that something blocks the light and therefore casts a shadow on the object. The most obvious example is the shadow people leave on the ground on a sunny day. But, these can also be smaller, such as when used to make strands of hair stand out in a ball of fur.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DrawingFourShadingTypes.png" /></p>

<p>The fact that light is reflected is actually the only reason we can see things. For instance, an orange absorbs all light waves, except for orange light waves---those are reflected towards your eyes. When shading your drawing, you'll probably have to deal with lots of reflected highlights, and keep in mind those have their own colour and strength too.</p>

<p>Crest shadows are somewhat equivalent to soft edges. The soft edges I've mentioned several times can only be seen because of the shadow they produce, and because they're soft, they produce smooth and gradual shadows.</p>

<p>Cast shadows, on the other hand, can be either sharp or smooth. Why this is the case, and how to figure out placement and size of shadows, is discussed in next chapter.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>The only exercise I think is very important to do regularly, is shading the basic shapes. Draw any of the basic shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder, pyramid, cone), and go through all four shading types to add them. Just as basic shapes were the first step to creating complex forms, shading basic shapes is the first step to shading complex forms. You can start with rough shading, and later try adding colour or more subtlety/complexity.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Shading"
  post: "<p>Without further ado, let's get into the actual practice of shading your drawing! I will spend most time explaining methods to get precise shadows, but of course there's always the alternative to just estimate and go with your intuition. It's not necessary to formally establish the shadows for each and every object---for small objects it's fine to just go with the flow, and objects largely in the background or shadows of others also don't need much attention.</p> 

<h2>Shadow Lines</h2>

<p>The easiest way to find out your shadows, is using <strong>shadow lines</strong>. They work like this:</p>

<p>Starting from your light source, draw straight lines that barely touch the edges of the object. The area between these lines now represents the <em>cast shadow</em>, as those are the light waves obstructed by your object. Additionally, the points where these lines hit the edges mark the possible place of a <em>crest shadow</em>.</p>

<p>Other crest shadows can't easily be found, as you'll need to know the 3D shape and texture of the object well. If you've figured out the places of soft edges, all you need to do is shade the side opposite to the light.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingShadowLines.png" /></p>

<p>It's important to remember that light waves will always move in a straight line forever, unless there's a good reason to change direction (such as reflection). Every type of light source can therefore be simulated using these straight lines. I think a good example of this is the fluorescent tube:</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingShadowLinesTube.png" /></p>

<p>NOTE: Instead of a rectangular tube, you could of course apply the same principle to a round light by drawing shadow lines from its sides. Shadow lines are everywhere!</p>

<h2>Diffraction</h2>

<p>One may now ask the question: <em>why are real-life cast shadows often soft and smooth?</em> And you'd have a point, because our shadow lines clearly show that no light could reach the cast shadow part, which means it should be equally shaded. Well, it's because of another property of light, called <strong>diffraction</strong>.</p>

<p>Diffraction is the ability of light waves to bend around obstacles or through openings. When an object is sufficiently smooth around the edges, its cast shadow will be smooth as well---a few light waves bend towards the cast shadow and make it soft.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingShadingDiffraction.png" /></p>

<p>In drawing, you'll see that shadows often look most realistic when smooth. But, that also means it's not always the case! When light is strong and bright, cast shadows are hard and crisp. For example, if you draw a scene under moonlight the shadows will be smooth, but on a bright sunny day there will be much sharper shadows. I think the best way to learn to tell the difference is just by observing which is the case in your scene, every time you draw something.</p>

<h2>Actual Shading Methods</h2>

<p>Knowing all this, you might start to wonder: <em>what do I do once I know my shadows? Just fill them with solid black or grey?</em> Well, you could, but it's not always the solution.</p>

<p>There are three main methods for adding shading,</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Crosshatching</strong>: Often used for light or uneven shadows. By continually crossing sets of 5-10 parallel lines over each other, you acquire darker and darker tones. Make sure to follow the contour lines of the object, otherwise it looks weird.</li>
	<li><strong>Continuous</strong>: Using circular motions, go over the whole area until all of it's filled with the same tone. Often used to acquire full shadows in big areas, but by staying at a certain spot longer, you can add a slight texture or smoothness in your shadows.</li>
	<li><strong>Flat</strong>: In flat shading, all shadow areas have hard edges, and are filled with the same (often relatively light) shadow tone. This type of shading is unrealistic, but looks nice, and is very popular in cartoon and other simple imagery.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, creating gradual shadows is done by simply going over darker areas with your pencil more often. <em>But what about when my drawing's in colour?</em> Don't fret, next chapter will be all about drawings and paintings in colour!</p>

<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>

<p>And last but not least, I'll share some tricks to use on your shading to enrich your drawing.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Map Areas of Light &amp; Dark</strong>. On your first shading pass, map every shaded or highlighted area as if they were territories on a map. Initially assign definite borders to your shadows, and later soften and modify some of these borders.</li>
	<li><strong>Merge Shadow Shapes. </strong>If multiple shadow shapes with only slightly different brightness overlap, it's best to merge them together into one shadow shape. This way you make the drawing less complicated, while keeping a good structure. If necessary, viewers will fill in the tiny details themselves automatically.</li>
	<li><strong>Contrast and Compare Tones. </strong>Tones appear light or dark in relation to each other. In a drawing with only dark blue colours, one orange line will seem very bright. In a drawing with yellow lines everywhere, the orange line will seem to be darker. Always establish a colour palette, otherwise you'll run into unexpected very dark or very bright areas.</li>
	<li><strong>Design with Light.</strong> As stated earlier, shadows and highlights can be used to create patterns or textures in otherwise flat objects. It's impossible to draw every single strand of hair on someone's head, but you can add the most apparent shadows and highlights to show the texture of the hair.</li>
	<li><strong>Intensify mood.</strong> You can add a deeper and more emotional quality to your drawings by use of striking lighting or unusual cast shadows. Don't overdo it though---otherwise your drawing will be unrecognizable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>Continuing on the previous exercise, we're going to step up our game a little. Instead of drawing and shading a single object, draw lots of basic shapes overlapping. This way lots of extra shadows and reflected lights come into play, and you'll really have to practice with your shading. Use only one light source the first few tries, to keep things simple for yourself.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Colouring"
  post: "<p>Most drawings these days are in colour. This doesn't really change much of your workflow or the principles behind the drawing, but it does require learning some colour theory, and how it interacts with shading your drawing.</p> 

<p>I strongly suggest reading the <strong><em>Colour Theory</em></strong> course. If you already have lots of knowledge about colours, read on! I won't use a lot of that colour theory here, but I do use basic concepts you need to be familiar with.</p>

<h2>Colour Shading</h2>

<p>To shade using colours, a colour palette of 5 colours is usually established.  In the centre of the palette, there's the <strong>base colour</strong>, which is the average or expected colour of the object. For example, an orange has base colour orange, while an apple (most of the time) has base colour red.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingShadingColourPalette.png" /></p>

<p>To the left of this base colour, we use two shading tones. The lighter one is for soft edges or reflected shadows, while the darkest colour is used for the darkest parts. Shading tones are acquired by lowering the <em>brightness</em> and <em>saturation</em> of the base colour.</p>

<p>To the right of this base colour, we use two highlighting tones. The lightest should be reserved for the actual spot where light hits an object, while the other should be used around it to make the transition to base colour smooth. Highlighting tones are acquired by raising the <em>brightness</em> and lowering the <em>saturation</em>.</p>

<p>Additionally, sometimes the hue of shadow tones is shifted to cooler colours (such as blue or purple), and the hue of highlighting tones to warmer colours (such as red or orange).</p>

<p>The big takeaway from this is that shadows are actually rarely solid black or grey, but also that the colour of the shadow on an object depends on its base colour. For example, a cast shadow from a green object onto a brown floor, is a dark brown colour. The shadow is a result of light not reaching some spots of the floor, not the object's colour somehow interacting with it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, highlights <em>are</em> a result of light, which means that if you place a green and blue object next to each other, they will have spots of reflected light on them, coloured as a mixture of green and blue.</p>

<h2>Overall Use of Colour</h2>

<p>Essentially, everything needs to be shaded, which means establishing such a colour palette for each object would seem ideal. Most of the time, however, using lots of different colours turns your drawing into a mess, and isn't realistic at all.</p>

<p>Instead, establish a 5-colour palette for your <em>entire drawing</em>. These can be completely unrelated colours, as long as they look good together. All the same, however, you'll need lighter and darker variations for lots of different objects, but the important thing is that we can now use those five colours we already have as a starting point.</p>

<p>Even when on a computer, achieving good colours is still best done the old way: by mixing colours.</p>

<p>If you want a darker version, add black to the colour. If you want a lighter version, add white to the colour. If multiple objects in your scene are interacting, mix their colours to get the right highlights and reflected lights.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingGeneralColourPalette.png" /></p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>Give yourself a start and end colour, and mix them to achieve a nice transition between them. Note that this can be done with any tools you like, such as colouring pencils, paint, or simulated using software on the computer.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Perspective"
  post: "<p>So far you've already drawn lots of things in perspective, and every time you drew a single object by using a set of vanishing points. If you want to draw more than one object, however, the perspective needs to be coherent. Two cubes right next to each other can't use completely different vanishing points, no matter the chosen perspective. Additionally, the vanishing points an object uses can't be too close to each other or at wrong angles, as this creates an unrealistic, distorted perspective.</p> 

<p>To make it easy to set up correct perspective for a complete drawing, a few rules have been invented.</p>

<h2>Horizons</h2>

<p>Let's say you're standing in the desert, with nothing but (flat) sand in front of you. How then, is it possible that you can't see the tree standing six kilometres in front of you? I mean, there's nothing standing in the way to block your sight, why do you only see sand?</p>

<p>Well, that's because the earth isn't flat, but spherical. After about five kilometres, the surface of the earth has curved away and out of our sight. The place where this happens, is what we call the <strong>horizon</strong>; the line separating ground and sky. In most scenes though, there will be lots of objects standing in the way---such as trees, buildings or people---which make the horizon less clear. Nevertheless, it's still there, and it tells us something important about our view.</p>

<p>NOTE: You <em>could</em> use a horizon that's not perfectly horizontal, but that's unnatural and often makes drawings unnecessarily complicated.</p>

<p>The horizon is linked directly to the <strong>eye level</strong>. When you draw something, you're viewing the scene from a particular eye level, which simply means the place where your eyes are. A low eye level means you see things from below, while a high eye level means you watch things from above. To communicate the eye level used in your drawing, all you need is a well-placed horizon. Simply put, just remember this: a low eye level means a low horizon, and a high eye level means a high horizon.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingPerspectiveHorizon.png" /></p>

<h2>One, Two and Three Point Perspective</h2>

<p>In theory, you could have as many vanishing points as you want, but one, two or three are usually the best way to go. All you need to do is set up your horizon and vanishing points before you start, and draw light "guidelines" from all of them to show yourself how lines should be angled.</p>

<h3>One-Point Perspective</h3>

<p>One vanishing point is used, which is placed somewhere on your horizon line. Useful for very open scenes, such as a railway or landscape. This determines what to do with angled lines, but what about perfectly horizontal and vertical lines? A new rule comes into play (which is also true for two-point perspective):</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt"><em>Lines parallel or perpendicular to the horizon always stay the same</em></p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingPerspectiveOnePoint.png" /></p>

<h3>Two-Point Perspective</h3>

<p>Two vanishing points are used, both placed at a different point on the horizon line. Useful for when you look at the side or corner of an object.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingPerspectiveTwoPoint.png" /></p>

<h3>Three-Point Perspective</h3>

<p>This is the same as two-point perspective, but with an extra vanishing point added somewhere above or below the horizon. Useful for when you view something from a very low or high eye level. The rule about vertical lines staying the same isn't applicable anymore; instead, they converge towards the third vanishing point.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingPerspectiveThreePoint.png" /></p>

<h2>An Important Note</h2>

<p>You might have noticed that this way of creating perspective is ideal for cubes, as those have lots of parallel lines, but not really for any other shape. And you'd be right. Some more advanced methods, such as four, five or six point perspective exist that turn your drawing into a sphere, but these still rely on the existence of parallel lines.</p>

<p>Instead, I want you to remember that we put lots of basic shapes inside boxes to make it easier to draw them. If you can draw a cube in perspective, and you know how to use it as a guideline to draw anything else, you can draw anything in perspective!</p>

<p>And last but not least: vanishing points can, and often will, be off-paper. In that case, simply draw arrows indicating the general placement of the vanishing point, and use those.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>The exercise is simple: draw something using one, two, or three-point perspective. Establish your horizon, establish your vanishing point(s), and draw random cubes that follow the guides you set out.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Texture"
  post: "<p>With all those perspective and shading skills under our belt, we can already make awesome drawings---but only of smooth solid objects! Nearly all things in the world have a visible texture, so what should we do with those?</p> 

<p>Well, just ignoring them would be the <em>last</em> thing to do. Instead, you need to find a way to simulate the textures, a way to create the visual illusion that the drawing has texture. I say visual illusion, because it's nearly impossible to perfectly copy a texture (and extremely time-consuming). What we need is to find certain types and patterns of strokes to simulate the texture we want.</p>

<h2>Some Possible Methods</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, there are no hard and fast rules for all textures; all I can do is give you general guidelines. Most of the time, using some reference material and performing a study on it allows you to get a feeling for how a certain texture should work out in a drawing---but more on that in later chapters.</p>

<h3>Articulate &amp; Suggest</h3>

<p>First, find out the general shapes of your texture. Try to get those on paper as perfectly as you can. Then, to fill in the rest of the texture, find a type of stroking that <em>suggests</em> the texture. It shouldn't be perfect, just enough to give the viewer the feeling that a certain texture is in place. By combining carefully drawn parts with loose parts, you can really give an object a sense of texture, without being too exact or sloppy.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingTextureSuggest.png" /></p>

<p>This brings us to another point with textures, which is <strong>imperfection is key</strong>. In real-life, all objects have at least slightly different textures, and copying the exact same texture for all objects makes your drawing look very unnatural. Try to repeat the overall pattern of the texture, yet vary it (slightly) every time you do so.</p>

<p>For lots of textures, the best way to suggest it is by drawing textured outlines instead of the regular, smooth line-work.</p>

<h3>Sense the Stroke</h3>

<p>If you have the object in front of you, or you have a very good imagination, it's of course always possible to just feel the texture of the object. Where does it have bumps? Where does it feel rough? At the end of this chapter I'll provide more concrete workflows for when you know what your texture is.</p>

<h3>Contrast &amp; Unify</h3>

<p>A texture is only as good as the ones around it. To make a texture stand out, contrast it with another one. For example, if everything in the drawing has furry textures it will probably look like a mess, but if you alternate between furry creatures and grassy landscape, the drawing will look really soft.</p>

<p>Alternatively, to combine objects and strengthen relationships between them, use textural strokes going through both objects. Essentially, this applies the same texture to both objects as if it were one.</p>

<h3>Texture in Perspective</h3>

<p>One thing that people often forget with textures, is that they also change at different angles or distances. To make sure your textural strokes concur with the current perspective, it's a good idea to draw some perspective lines from your vanishing points through the texture, and align parts of the texture with them. If that's not really possible, or too calculated for you, simply try to get a feel for how your texture would wrap around the object, and how it would change if you view it from a distance.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingTexturePerspective.png" /></p>

<h2>Texture Drawing in Practice</h2>

<p>Here I'd like to go over creating six very common types of textures. Not only can this help you directly (in case you needed this exact type of texture), but it also provides more insight into the world of texture drawing. I encourage you to practice drawing each of these textures at least once.</p>

<p>(ONE GRAND IMAGE of all specific textures?)</p>

<h3>Smooth</h3>

<p>The main thing about smooth objects, is of course that the texture is smooth. This mostly means that texture is portrayed through shading, which should be gradual. Additionally, this means that it's impossible to have spots of sudden darkness or brightness---everything is smooth. In real life, such objects are scarce though.</p>

<h3>Coarse</h3>

<p>Coarse objects follow the same rules as smooth ones, but also have certain spots ("dimples") of darkness/brightness all over the texture, and perhaps random short lines here and there. Overall, coarse textures are darker, as less light is reflected toward your eyes.</p>

<h3>Wood</h3>

<p>With wood, we need to learn to make a distinction between <em>flat texture</em> and <em>spatial texture</em>. Flat texture is just lines that are on top of an object's surface. Spatial textures are actually small grooves and bumps that change the look and shading of the object. With wood, we have both!</p>

<p>First draw some dark and light grain lines on your wood, and place random dots at different sizes over your texture. Make sure you don't overdo it, and don't place them too symmetrical. This is your flat texture</p>

<p>Then, add shading to the largest grain lines; these lines have spatial texture, which means that they have small highlights at one side, and small shadows at the other.</p>

<p>Then, last but not least, add shading <em>on top of the details</em> like you would with a smooth or coarse object (depending on your type of wood). On the computer, this can easily be done by putting it on a new layer and lowering the opacity. With your hand, you just need to add lighter and more careful shading in areas with details.</p>

<h3>Fur</h3>

<p>Fur is messy, and you should allow it to be that way. First give your object its base tone by crosshatching it entirely. Then, in darker areas, add shading by means of more and more crosshatching. In lighter areas, do the same but with a light colour. If you're not working on computer, you can add fur highlights by erasing random strokes of the texture.</p>

<p>Fur is the only texture where shades and highlights almost always overlap; different hairs go in all directions, which means that different coloured strokes can all overlap. On top of that, the contour of the object is changed as well with this texture; instead of a straight contour line, draw random strokes over it sticking out at all places.</p>

<h3>Stone</h3>

<p>Stones are the same as a smooth/coarse texture (again, depending on the type of stone), so start with a stony base colour and shade it as usual. Then, add <em>cracks</em> to the stone. These are quite thick, sharp and random lines (just as with the wood grain). But, even more so than with wood, these are spatial textures and need highlights and shadows to make them pop out. Additionally, you can add random dark and light dots to indicate even more bumpiness.</p>

<h3>Reflective</h3>

<p>Reflective shapes combine two textures; their own and the ones around them.</p>

<p>First, draw what is being reflected on the object, using the same colours and shadows. Remember that reflective shapes don't magically add new shadows, they simply reflect back what they see. Also remember that there's a horizon out there that it should reflect, which means that a reflective shape never has parts that show nothing.</p>

<p>Then, on top of that, shade the object as if it were smooth and add its own colour to the mix. Reflective coarse textures are also possible, but they heavily distort their reflections, which means you can go wild.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] Studies & References"
  post: "<p>I've shown you how to construct anything out of basic shapes and forms. I've shown you how to add realism and enrichment to your drawings. Nevertheless, I'm guessing you still can't just draw something whenever you think of it. Somehow, imagining and picturing 'dragon' in your head is different from actually getting it on the paper. Humans just can't memorize every single detail their eyes have ever seen, nor create an equally detailed and complex image from imagination.</p> 

<h2>Finding References</h2>

<p>Some people think it's bad to use references and look at what other artists have done, but it's actually one of the first steps in any project. A big part of starting a drawing is, quite logically, finding your subject. You might see an interesting composition right as you look out of the window, but more often than not you'll need to gather some <em>references</em>. Those can be anything that helps or inspires you, such as photographs, other drawings, other objects, maybe even books or music.</p>

<p>The most common practice, however, is drawing from photographs. Especially when working on the computer or drawing from imagination, I always start by looking for pictures that resemble what I want or that show certain parts that I'm thinking of including. The obvious caveat here is that you're inclined to just trace the image, reducing your creativity and interpretation to a level near zero. While starting out as an artist, this can be a good way to get a feeling for the whole drawing process, but I strongly discourage this practice later on. Look at photographs for inspiration, to remind yourself what something looks like, or to solve some technical problems (with for example shading or perspective)---don't copy them directly.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingReferenceBoard.png" /></p>

<h2>"Steal like an Artist"</h2>

<p>An especially useful way to get your creative juices flowing, is to copy and emulate other artists, be it their general style or their actual drawings. There's a lot to learn from the "masters", and it is far easier than having to come up with something all by yourself. Now, before you start with your 'but that is stealing!' and 'where is the creativity in that?!'---there's nothing wrong with this. Every thought that pops in your head has probably already been executed by somebody else, the idea is that you look at that and try to improve it and imbue it with your own style.</p>

<h2>Performing Studies</h2>

<p>To learn to look at references, and memorize what you learn, it's best to regularly perform something called a <em>study</em>. When you perform a study, you forget everything you (think you) know about something, and instead try to closely copy what you see. You try to see every line, curve, shape, or texture as it is with that particular object, and more importantly, you try to write down your findings, comments remarks.</p>

<p>This way, you learn to <em>see</em> the world in a way that allows you to draw it, but you also have a way of storing and memorizing what you've learned so far. Most objects have some general truths to them, whatever style they're drawn in, and it's good to build your knowledge on these matters. These can be simple yet extremely useful findings, such that hair always has pointy ends.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingReferenceStudy.png" /></p>

<p>Another way of performing a study, is something called a <em>tiny study</em>. Look at a reference, and copy it but in a much smaller frame. This forces you to identify the main shapes, colours and composition in your reference.</p>

<p><img src="media/DrawingReferenceTinyStudy.png" /></p>

<p>Whenever you don't know what to do anymore with your project, do a study or two. Next chapters will look at more ways to acquire the right mind-set that allows you to draw anything you think of, and don't get stuck in your project.</p>

  title: "[Drawing] The Right Mind-set I"
  post: "<p>Many people think they can't draw. Or maybe they remember being awesome at drawing when they were young, but never draw anymore because they're afraid to disappoint themselves. But those people are wrong, and the biggest reason for this is the fact that people lose contact with their visual abilities as they grow older. In school, all focus is on learning languages and mathematics---not on designing or painting. In the business world, the biggest focus is on solving problems with numbers and writing articles or reports---not on the layout and visuals of, well, everything.</p> 

<p>The reason for this, is the domination of the logical side of our brain. (And, of course, partly to blame on the business culture, but nothing I can do about that.) People have a brain consisting of two halves, simply called the left side and the right side, which both perform different functions. The left side is about language, mathematics, constructing logical series of thoughts. The right side controls creativity, visuals, senses, imagination.</p>

<p>You'll probably recognize the moment when you want to draw something, and hear some mind chatter saying 'No way you can draw this', or 'That eye looks ridiculous', or 'That body has all the wrong proportions. Just stop drawing already. Go calculate something, jeez.' That annoying voice is the only thing standing in the way. The left side of the brain is the most used and exercised one, and therefore tries to control everything you do. When you want to express your artistic feelings, the left side comes around the corner to tell you it's a waste of time and there's only a slight chance of success.</p>

<p>Of course, it's impossible to just shut down half of the brain, and equally impossible to mute it on command. Instead, what we'll try to do, is make it uninterested in judging the drawing, and that way allow your visual perception and mental imagery to do all the work. This way you'll learn to see things for what they really are: just a bunch of lines, curves, tones and shades that <em>magically</em> form a beautiful image once put together.</p>

<h2>How do I know I'm doing it right?</h2>

<p>The shift from left brain mode to right brain mode happens unconsciously, but you can recognize you are (or have been) in visual mode by noticing one of the following things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You lost track of time. Without looking at the clock, you really can't make a good estimate of how long you've been drawing.</li>
	<li>Your drawing feels like a puzzle. You want to draw the next line, the next shape, the next line, and so on until you have the whole picture transferred to the paper. You want to know what the end product will look like. As you're finishing, it feels like solving the most fun puzzle on earth.</li>
	<li>You're not being judgmental. You don't worry about wasting energy, or that a few lines might not be perfect, or that something might be out of proportion---you keep drawing until you find a way for everything to fit together nicely.</li>
	<li>You're thinking in comparisons. Instead of measuring things exactly, or assigning symbols to them, you compare every new thing with something you've already drawn. You don't care what the real size of that door is, you only know how to draw the rest of the scene at a suitable scale.</li>
	<li>You see relationships you didn't see before. You see common shapes, common colours or shades, things that seem connected. This is what usually makes a drawing radically different from a photograph---the uniqueness of your perception translates to a creative and unique drawing.</li>

  title: "[Drawing] The Right Mind-set II"
  post: "<p>To make matters clear, and those statements from last chapter more concrete, I'll provide you with a list of very useful guidelines.</p> 

<h2>Activating the Right Side</h2>

<p>There are lots of small tips and tricks for engaging your visual senses, which are to be applied in no particular order or quantity.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Practical Dialogue. </strong>When you talk to yourself during drawing, don't name anything. Assigning names and identifying things is done by the left side of your brain, and you don't want that. Talk to yourself in the language of line and shape; <em>how long is this line compared to that one? How big is this ellipse compared to that curve? Is this shadow dark enough compared to my other shadows?</em> Don't ask yourself why things are the way they are, just draw them the way you see them.</li>
	<li><strong>Draw Blind. </strong>If you're drawing, and you find yourself unable to get a certain part on paper, draw blind for a small amount of time. This simply means that you keep your eyes on the <em>subject</em> while continuing to draw.</li>
	<li><strong>Don't Erase </strong>everything. No such thing as a perfect line exists. Once you start erasing things you're not satisfied with, you end up in a downward spiral that makes you doubt your whole drawing (skills). Sure, it often happens that you draw a line and think it looks too big or small or curvy compared to the rest, but instead of erasing it just redraw the correct line over it. In the end you can always decide to erase some blatant errors, but you can't bring back erased lines from the dead!</li>
	<li><strong>Choose Seeing over Knowing. </strong>Concentrate on your subject rather than on your drawing. As a child, most people memorize certain symbols for drawing certain things: a circle is an eye, a slightly curved line is a mouth, etcetera. Unless you were a child prodigy---in which case I don't understand why you're reading this---these symbols are what often make your drawings look childish. Draw exactly what you see, however unrealistic or improbable it may seem from your current angle or viewpoint.</li>
	<li><strong>Choose Seeing over Knowing (Again). </strong>Often times, what you see doesn't stroke with your knowledge about the object. Noticing this shuts down the visual senses and activates the logical one, making it nearly impossible for you to decide how to draw something. For example, we all know that the wall and ceiling of a house (generally) coincide with each other at a straight corner, but when you look at such a corner in your house and draw it, you'll notice that perspective radically changes this in the flat drawing. Go with what you see, not with what you think to be true.</li>
	<li><strong>Simplify Shapes. </strong>When in danger of being overwhelmed by the complex details of your subject, squinting your eyes will make them manageable. Also, closing one eye forces you to view the world without depth, making it easier to translate real-life objects to a 2D drawing on paper.</li>
</ul>

<p>You might be wondering now: <em>what's all this text about, if you're claiming I need to eliminate anything related to language?</em> Well, ironically, I found I couldn't really explain some of the concepts in the course by drawing a picture. By repeating these processes time and time again, they become habits, and you don't need to remind yourself to do them, eliminating the verbal aspect and leaving only the visual processes.</p>

<p>One last (general) advice is to look at the world in as many new and different ways as possible. For example, to fire up your visual system you could look at subjects upside down, or place them in such strange light that you can't easily make out what is what. You can come up with all sorts of things to get your brain to look only at the shapes and contours, and the interplay between them, instead of trying to identify objects and patterns all the time.</p>

  post: "<p>Most of this course has been rules and guidelines which are generally best to follow, which means all your drawings might look quite alike. This chapter will try to help you add imaginative pieces to your drawing, and to be creative with your methods, shapes and compositions.</p> 

<p>Lots of people think 'nah, I'm just not creative' whenever they are presented with a task that requires even the slightest amount of creativity. While it is true that some people seem to have a knack for creativity and others don't, it's still the same process for every person and can be taught.

<p>To help you get a feeling for this, ask yourself the following questions before (or during) work on a drawing:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Are there certain parts I find especially interesting?</em></li>
	<li><em>What is the overall mood I'm trying to accomplish, and what style or arrangement helps with that?</em></li>
	<li><em>What are all the different ways I know to draw that object or texture?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Usually, from this point you start searching your mind for old ideas you've had once, and combining them with new ones. In this process thoughts will often pop into your head that require further investigation, and you should do so---doing a quick search on the internet or through your possessions usually reveals some kind of answer to the question, if you're open to it. Keep finding interesting and new things everywhere, until you have a clear picture of what and how you want your masterpiece to end up. Of course, you shouldn't make this decision fixed; as you draw, let other thoughts take over if you have a feeling they're better.</p>

<p>To give an example, say I wanted to draw a warrior for my newest computer game. First question: <em>what is the style of the game/warrior?</em> I decide on a realistic, yet simplified style. This means that I define a thick border around my warrior to make it easy to identify, yet draw every part to scale and add realistic shadows. Second question: <em>what parts should be included?</em> Well, in my mind a warrior is a tall handsome guy, who has a thick armour, a large shield and a glimmering sword. But that doesn't fit my comical style; instead, I decide on a small posture, a crooked sword, and messy hair sticking through the helmet everywhere. Third question: <em>what to do with the shield and other clothing?</em> I don't know, so I look up pictures of warriors and try to combine multiple elements to fit with my own drawing. If it still doesn't work, I just leave parts out or slightly change the shapes until it does feel right.</p>

<p>This process goes on and on, and combines memories and feelings about objects with real-life references and maybe artwork other people have created. Imagination needs something to work with, but that something can be very small or strange, or maybe even completely unrelated.  </p>

<h2>Finding your Handwriting</h2>

<p>Creativity and imagination comes from how you tackle certain parts of a drawing, which in turn depends on your own style. I'll call this your <strong>handwriting</strong> from now on. When you first start out, you probably don't know what you want or like to do, and that's natural: your style needs time to develop and grow. Over time, I promise, you'll start to find out what type of line you like in particular, what set of symbols look beautiful when arranged in a certain way, etcetera. The best way to do so, is by experimenting a lot.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, two general types of handwriting must be developed and used by every draughtsman:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Free Handwriting: </strong>Loose, fast and intuitive. When you quickly want to sketch something, for example, you use this free handwriting. In a few swift strokes, try to capture the overall action of your subject rather than correct proportions or accurate details. Drawing freely often is a good way to get a large scene on paper very quickly, or to sketch the idea or feeling of what you want to achieve.</li>
	<li><strong>Control Handwriting: </strong>On the other end, there's very controlled drawing. Used when working on small areas, carefully and patiently refining the lines and rendering the tones of your subject. Controlled handwriting is evaluated and changed frequently, as to make sure every detail, proportion and shade is perfect.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DrawingDifferentHandwritings.png" /></p>

<p>In general, any drawing is a combination of these two handwritings. Although they are both concerned with lines and shades in the same way, you'll find them to be very different as you apply them. You'll see that most drawings need some parts drawn freely (such as textures or gestures), and some parts drawn controlled, for the best effect. Controlled handwriting is similar for everyone, while free handwriting really showcases your personal style and taste.</p>

<p>To help yourself to consciously make the difference, employ a different grip for each handwriting. For controlled handwriting, use the grip you're used to, with your fingers near the pencil point. For free handwriting, place your grip around halfway up the pencil, to keep it loose and swinging.</p>

<h2>Experiment</h2>

<p>Experimenting is one of the cornerstones of the drawing process. Whenever you're stuck, or just need a little extra something, the best idea is to just <em>experiment</em>. Try different tools, different paper, different grips, different symbols, different styles/handwritings (for example, by copying the style of a painter you particularly like)---whatever you can think of.</p>

<p>Think out of the box, and everything becomes an amazing tool. Your eraser can be used to create highlights on an object, or differently shaped lines. Your hand can be used to smudge/wipe lines to achieve a gradual shading or texture effect. On the computer, lots of effects and layered blending can be applied. The possibilities are endless!</p>

<p>Usually, trying something new will compose a new idea, shed new light on your subject, or accidentally create a new way of drawing you can use for your next project. If it doesn't, it's still not wasted time; you've experimented, and now know what you don't like.</p>

<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>

<p>If this all seems vague to you, don't worry; I have included some methods you can (and probably should) use to let your imagination run wild.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Join Two Worlds.</strong> The creative process is the act of joining two unrelated worlds. In drawing, that means combining at least two different ideas, which may have only a remote connection to each other, on the same piece of paper.</li>
	<li><strong>Be Playful.</strong> Adopt a playful attitude towards your drawing and yourself; be loose, friendly and try to add a sense of humour. Don't worry about how your drawing will turn out, but get into the spirit of the moment. You don't have to know what the finished product should look like, or the exact process for getting there; just keep drawing every idea that pops into your head until at a certain point you look up and you feel satisfied. In other words: go with the flow.</li>
	<li><strong>Make the Familiar Strange.</strong> A good way to get into imaginative drawing, is making something familiar and commonplace feel strange or out of place. This could mean drawing something from an unusual or obscured view, combining unrelated elements, changing the relative sizes of the elements, distorting, rearranging, or symbolizing.</li>
	<li><strong>Draw in Sequence.</strong> Doing a series of drawings with small changes in between each one create a healthy environment for your imagination. Each drawing leads to further discoveries that can be applied to the next drawing, but you don't have to start from scratch every time.</li>
	<li><strong>Employ Diverse Sources.</strong> Visuals and non-visuals alike are rich sources of inspiration. Incorporate influences from art, photography, and television, as well as from poetry, literature, and music. Of course, don't copy work exactly or fill in every piece of the drawing with something already done by someone. If this seems difficult, try to incorporate the most powerful of sources: your own intimate and personal experiences.</li>
	<li><strong>Explore Themes.</strong> Over a (long) period of time, create drawings of similar settings, but with different style or theme. Paradoxically, when you narrow your focus this way, you widen the potential for discovery. You might find a style you really like or inspires you, or you might find a new combination of themes you haven't seen anywhere before.</li>

  title: "[Drawing] Conclusion: what now?"
  post: "<p>You've learnt everything! Nah, I'm just kidding. You've learnt all the fundamentals of drawing, and probably a bit more than that, but I don't expect you to be a master painter now. As I said at the start, most of your drawing skills come from practice and actually trying to apply all these principles. Because this course is so general, however, I do encourage you to look into more specific styles or subjects now. If you want to draw cartoon strips, read a course wholly focused on cartoons. If you want to draw cats, read a course on that (or one on animals in general).</p> 

<p>Alternatively, if you just want to use your drawing skills as an aid in any visual design process, I encourage you to read the courses on <strong><em>design</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I haven't found the time to create such courses thus far. Remind me to update this chapter when I have done that.</p>

<p>I wish you the best of luck for now, and practice, practice, practice! Your understanding of the world of drawing is superior to most of the people, but if you don't learn to apply this theory nobody will be impressed ;)</p>

  title: "[Colour Theory] Usage within Design"
  post: "<p>This course has mentioned nearly everything that has to do with colour theory, but you might be left with the question: <em>what am I supposed to do with all this information?</em> Well, this chapter will talk about how to apply the principles in your next design project, and we will look at what functions colour can actually take on.</p>

<h2>Colour Functionality</h2>

<p>Colours can have <em>a lot</em> of functions. I must note, however, that colour shouldn't be your only way of creating graphical differentiation between elements to communicate meaning; a large part of the population has <em>colour-blindness</em>, and they would not be able to use your design if you relied solely on colour to establish your hierarchy.</p>

<h3>Attracting Attention</h3>

<p>First and foremost, colour can make design elements stand out or disappear. It can highlight elements, or intentionally hide them. We've already seen how to do this; warm and saturated colours attract attention, while cool and muted palettes redirect attention elsewhere, but context and contrast plays an important role. Using colours with contrasting values tends to bring shapes into sharp focus, while combining colours that are close in value softens the distinction between elements.</p>

<p>In other words, use warm colours for foreground elements, and cooler colours for background elements. Create contrast between them.</p>

<p><img src="media/ColourTheoryAttractAttention.png" /></p>

<h3>Grouping</h3>

<p>Secondly, colour groups elements. Elements with the same colour are perceived as related, while elements with drastically different colours are perceived as distinct. Light grey is always a safe colour to use for grouping elements without competing with other colours.</p>

<p>One of the strongest methods of grouping is associating like shapes with like shapes; if a bunch of squares stands close to each other, we assume them to form a single group. Similarly, we immediately associate shapes by colour, but keep in mind this association is generally much <strong>stronger</strong>.</p>

<img src="media/ColourTheoryGrouping.png" />

<h3>Convey a Mood or Message</h3>

<p>Thirdly, colour conveys a mood, attitude or message. It creates an emotional, psychological and even physical response to a lifeless design. It sets the mood and reinforces the message. For example, light colours produce happy and pleasant responses, whereas darker colours produce quieter effects. A natural colour palette conveys a message of being one with nature and caring for the environment, while a minimalistic grayscale palette conveys a message of simplicity and sleekness.</p>

<h3>Describe Reality or other Information</h3>

<p>Colour is also used to precisely mimic how something looks in the real world, or to codify artificial types of information. By assigning a colour to a category within a design, we can make the viewer associate that category with the colour, thus leading to coding specific information into a colour.</p>

<h3>Enhance Aesthetics</h3>

<p>And last but not least, colours can be used just because they are beautiful. They can create variety, give a feeling of depth, and just generally make a design more interesting and dynamic. It creates visual interest, even when the palette is subtle or even looks bad.</p>

<h2>Backgrounds</h2>

<p>This colour choice arguably has the most impact on your design, as it's the biggest element, yet it has to stay in the background and go by unnoticed.</p>

<p>White is the dominant colour, especially for global or e-commerce websites, because people are used to reading from white pages. Slightly off-white or cream colours are also popular, and give a sense of nature or antiqueness.</p>

<p>Dark backgrounds aren't popular, and mostly used for stylistic purposes or designs about things that take place in the night.</p>

<p>Extremely bright backgrounds certainly make an impact, but more often than not a bad one. Therefore, reserve bright backgrounds to short parts, a magazine cover or a splash page.</p>

  title: "Complete Typography Guide"
  post: "<p>Typography is perhaps the most important aspect of any design. Most information you're going to convey will be structured using our familiar alphabet, and most of a design's surface is going to be the body text. It's a sad fact, therefore, that it's often neglected. Lots of people pick their favourite parts of a design, and only decide on and implement the font(s) later on. Throughout this course, you will see that the font you choose has a huge impact on how you need to set the different parameters and elements within your design, and is something that can't be set easily or arbitrarily. This course will try to help you take your typography more seriously!</p>

<p>There's a lot to discuss, so to keep things structured, I'll be moving from the smallest element towards the biggest. I will start at defining all sorts of things about individual <em>letters</em> (and some special characters), then move on to combining letters into <em>words</em>, then into <em>lines</em>, which create <em>text blocks</em>, and ultimately end up at how typography works combined with <em>other design elements</em>.</p>

<p>Additionally, throughout the course there will be exercises or specific instructions to <em>not</em> make a certain mistake. I will simply announce these with the words <strong>type exercise</strong> and <strong>type error</strong>.</p>

  title: "[Typography] What is Typography?"
  post: "<p>Broadly speaking, there are three important stages when working on your design's typography: <em>type matching</em>, <em>defining hierarchy</em>, and <em>refining</em>.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyThreeStages.png" /></p>

<p>In the first stage, you find typefaces that convey the message, mood and feeling you want. More importantly, you find multiple typefaces (or styles from the same family) that work well together in a design.</p>

<p>In the second stage, you use the fonts you have to create, well, a hierarchy. You define which specific size, style, weight, placement, etcetera you will use for each level within the hierarchy. Maybe you use an extremely large, but light version of a font for headlines, and a regularly sized one for body text. And perhaps you decide to use blue italic text for comments, or red condensed text for emphasis.</p>

<p>Then, in the third stage, you refine the parameters and properties of your typography (together with design elements around it) to make it fit within a specific design. This means slightly changing the amount of space, or size, or placement, or alignment of the text to make it fit perfectly---like a glove---within a certain part of the design.</p>

<p>None of these stages is more important than the other. Even though refining may seem quick and easy to you, or matching typefaces may seem like a breeze, they should all be executed with the same amount of care and professionalism.</p>

<p>To give a specific answer to this chapter's main question, <em>typography</em> is the act of using a set of symbols (our alphabet) to convey not only the information they describe, but also the mood and feeling of the content, to strengthen the relationships with other elements within the design, and to improve the aesthetics.</p>

<p>Design, in general, should never rely on arbitrary or whimsical judgments. The words you choose to put in your design are equally important as <em>how</em> you put them into the design. Now, the rest of this course will teach you fundamental concepts and strategies to properly execute all these stages. At the end, when you've become all excited about typography, I'll give some more tips and tricks and outline the whole design process. When it comes to the evolution and history of type, I won't discuss that; there's a gigantic amount of information regarding this topic, but it's not absolutely necessary to know.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Fundamental Terminology"
  post: "<p>A big part of learning how to work with, well, anything, is learning to name and describe all the different aspects. Once you know what something is called and what it looks like, you can find it everywhere and use it as part of your typesetting process. If you're going for a serious and formal look in a design, for example, you don't want to pick a typeface with typical characteristics representing playfulness informality. Or, if you're trying to match several fonts, you typically want to combine fonts with a nearly identical look for some of a letter's key aspects.</p>

<h2>Fonts versus Typefaces</h2>

<p>Although the terms are used interchangeably nowadays, and I often do so as well, I want to make the distinction here for clarity. A <em>typeface</em> (or sometimes <em>type family</em>) refers to a certain design, a certain style, a certain look. A <em>font</em> is one instance of such a typeface, a certain weight, size or variation on the overall theme of the typeface. A font is a single file on your computer, a typeface a large collection of font files within the same folder.</p>

<p>In other words, a typeface is a family of similar fonts. Garamond, for example, is a typeface, while Garamond Bold, or Garamond Condensed, or ITC Garamond are fonts that belong to it. A font is a subset of characters of a typeface.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyTypefaceFont.png" /></p>

<p>In general, multiple fonts from the same typeface go very well together, and it's encouraged to explore all the different font styles of the same typeface before reaching out and looking for another to add to your project. I hope I also made it clear that <em>type</em> and <em>typography</em> aren't the same; a typographer is a person who works with type to create a good design.</p>

<h2>Uppercase, Lowercase &amp; Small Caps</h2>

<p>Just to make sure, let's recap some basic terminology regarding type. <em>Lowercase</em> letters are the ones you encounter most often, and are what have created this sentence. <em>Uppercase</em> or <em>capital</em> letters are the ones you, for example, start your sentences with. They are bigger than lowercase, and usually have an altered form to make it look better and more distinct.</p>

<p>Additionally, a compromise between the two exists, called <em>small caps</em>. They have the same form as capital letters, yet the same size as lowercase letters. This makes them ideal for fitting in between blocks of lowercase text.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyUpperLowercase.png" /></p>

<p>Every font at least supports these three types of symbols. If small caps are not natively available, however, your computer will automatically simulate them by shrinking down uppercase letters. This rarely gives you the effect you want, so always opt for using fonts with specially designed small caps embedded within them.</p>

<h2>Naming the Parts</h2>

<p>I said I'd start small, and what's smaller than the parts of a single letter? There are lots of common aspects to any letter, even when the style is radically different, and on top of that there are little characteristics that ornament and define a typeface.</p>

<p>First, let's look at the size and placement of letters; how do designers make type look so clean and connected, instead of just a bunch of symbols? Well, there are a few important guidelines that most if not all letters adhere to.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyBasicTerminology.png" /></p>

<p>The <strong>baseline</strong> is the line all letters "sit on". There might be parts sticking out at the top and bottom, but you'll always be able to notice an overall baseline in a line of text.</p>

<p>The <strong>x-height</strong> is simply the name for the height of the body of lowercase letters. It's named that way because it's equal to the height of a lowercase x. Most of the time, fonts strictly follow this x-height, but fonts with more ornamentation or large, sweeping curves often extend a slightly beyond it.</p>

<p>The <strong>ascenders</strong> are the parts of some lowercase letters (such as "b" and "d") that extend above the x-height. The <strong>descenders</strong> are the parts of some lowercase letters (such as "p" and "q") that fall below the baseline. Most of the time, these also adhere to an <em>ascender line</em> and <em>descender line </em>evident across all letterforms within the typeface.</p>

<p>The <strong>cap-height</strong> represents the height of an uppercase letter. It can be the same as the height of ascenders, but is often raised slightly higher. Capitals rarely have ascenders or varying heights, as it just looks messy.</p>

<p>Additionally, we can look at specific parts of letters present in every typeface. These need no explanation; the following image will show what they look like.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyAdvancedTerminology.png" /></p>

<p>I do have to mention that <em>modulation</em> and <em>counters</em> are very important when it comes to classifying typefaces, and identifying weak or bad spots within a typographic design.</p>

<p><em>Modulated strokes</em> simply vary line width at curves, especially at spots where several curves intersect. Unmodulated strokes have a fixed width for every stroke. Modulated typefaces are often regarded as better, though this modulation can be very subtle. The reason for this is that the visual weight is more evenly spread across a letter, which greatly increases legibility. It's also for that reason that Comic Sans is universally hated by typographers.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Typeface Classification"
  post: "<p>So soon in the course, we've already hit a sensitive subject; how to classify all typefaces on earth---and that's <em>a lot</em>---into a simple, easy to understand system. It is for that reason that no single, universal system exists. Being able to classify typefaces when you see them, however, is such an important skill that I still want to go over the classification that seems to have been agreed on by most.</p>

<p>Typefaces can be divided into the following groups: <em>serif</em>, <em>sans-serif</em>, <em>graphic</em>. The largest groups are the first two, which can then be further categorized by their style: <em>humanist</em>, <em>geometrical</em> or <em>transitional</em>.</p>

<p>NOTE:<strong> Type Exercise:</strong> After reading this chapter, pick a few of your favourite fonts and try to classify them! Even better, try to pick two fonts from the same classification and see if you can make them work well together.</p>

<h2>Humanist</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyHumanist.png" /></p>

<p>Often also called <em>old style</em>, it has rounded features and modulated strokes. The vertical axis for all letters is slightly slanted. Terminals are pear shaped, and lowercase counters relatively small.</p>

<p>These typefaces were among the earliest created, and are based upon efficiency. The forms of the letters are influenced by the human body and the nature of the pen tip.</p>

<h2>Geometrical</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyGeometrical.png" /></p>

<p>Also called <em>modern</em>, these typefaces create their letters out of basic geometrical shapes (such as triangle, square, circle), and often have perfectly round counters. The vertical axis is upright, and extra features (such as serifs) are hair thin. They have no modulation, or extreme modulation. Nearly every part of every letter is geometrically rationalized.</p>

<p>Geometrical typefaces have also produced so-called <em>monospaced fonts</em> and <em>bitmap fonts</em>.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyMonospaced.png" /></p>

<p>Monospaced fonts use the exact same width and height for all characters, making it ideal for places where the text is dynamic or subject to change. For example, manuscripts are usually send to the editor/publisher with monospaced font, and formatting happens later. Or, within video games or websites, dynamic counters often use monospaced numbers so that the width doesn't change all the time.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyBitmap.png" /></p>

<p>Bitmap fonts have been created specifically for the computer, and are built out of raw pixels, from the bottom up. On a computer screen the difference or usability is small, but on less-capable screens (such as that of microwaves or other devices) it's the best option when it comes to practicality and legibility.</p>

<h2>Transitional</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyTransitional.png" /></p>

<p>Also called <em>realist</em>, it tries to find a balance between humanist and geometrical typefaces. The vertical axis is upright (or nearly so), the strokes heavily modulated, the serifs sharp and relatively visible. While not always the case, transitional typefaces often have a larger natural x-height.</p>

<p>They are often regarded as ordinary or "invisible", making them ideal if you want to place all focus on the text, but this can also result in boring design.</p>

<h2>Serif</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographySerifTypefaces.png" /></p>

<p>Not surprisingly, serif typefaces have serifs on their letters. Those are nothing more than any sort of decoration at the end of a stroke. Instead of just randomly ending a stroke or chopping it off with a square ending, a serif adds some subtle ornamentation to every letter, also increasing legibility.</p>

<p>In general, this makes them the best choice for when things are printed, displayed at a large size, or displayed on high-resolution screens.</p>

<h2>Slab Serif</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographySlabSerif.png" /></p>

<p>Also called <em>Egyptian</em>, these typefaces are a special kind of serif. They have very little modulation or contrast in stroke width, and an upright vertical axis (when apparent). They also sport boxy serifs that are generally the same weight as the rest of the strokes within the letterform.</p>

<h2>Sans-Serif</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographySansSerifTypefaces.png" /></p>

<p>As opposed to serif typefaces, sans-serif typefaces do <em>not</em> have these serifs, which makes them look drastically different. The stroke width is also more uniform and even, in general.</p>

<p>Because of this, there's less "clutter" and the fonts look cleaner on screens or at small sizes. Those serifs actually add noise to the page, but that is actually a good thing; without a bit of noise, type looks cold and mechanical, but with it, it looks alive and breathing.</p>

<h2>Graphic</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyGraphicTypefaces.png" /></p>

<p>Graphic typefaces can come from a lot of different backgrounds or themes. In essence, though, we can distinguish three categories:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Script</em>: These typefaces look like they have been hand-lettered, like someone is using his handwriting within the design. Should not be used too much, because of its reduced legibility. When displayed large, however, it can look stunning.</li>
	<li><em>Display</em>: These typefaces don't look like handwriting, yet display similar characteristics. They contain letterforms that are very useful for decorative purposes, such as within a special logo or a heading of one or two words, but not for long pieces of text.</li>
	<li><em>Symbol</em>: Everything that's left over. These can be typefaces including only symbols or icons (instead of letters), or letters written in a style that's unlike any of the others I've mentioned.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, graphic typefaces are more goofy, creative, unique, comical and better at attracting attention. More often than not, though, less is more.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Finding Fonts"
  post: "<p>With all this knowledge about letterforms and styles under our belt, we can start picking the right fonts for our typographic projects. Even when you're only going to use different fonts from the same typeface, you still need to find the font that portrays the right mood and message within your design.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, though, fonts don't come with a description "reminds people of rock 'n roll" or "radiates with joy". The meaning of a font depends on its historical and cultural meaning, its visual forms and typesetting, and most importantly its context. Before you use a font, find out what it was initially made for, how it has evolved, and what feeling the forms evoke. For example, large sweeping curves usually create a free, natural, joyful feeling, while big blocky letters create a colder, formal, or more sad feeling. But not always.</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Exercise:</strong> Pick a word, preferably an emotion or feeling, and make it look like what it means.</p>

<h2>Professional Fonts</h2>

<p>There's a difference between <em>professional fonts</em> and so-called <em>system fonts</em>. The latter is the set of fonts automatically installed on every computer, such as Arial and Helvetica, which are quite generic and neutral. Professional fonts, on the other hand, have been hand-crafted by typographers to include as beautiful and as many characters as possible. As you can pick up from my choice of words, professional fonts are the way to go.</p>

<p>Professional, however, doesn't necessarily mean expensive or paid at all. Amazing fonts have been put online for free, and I recommend you start experimenting with those first, before spending all your capital on fonts. Paid fonts, however, will always be more unique, special and specific than anything else you might encounter. Paid fonts include all sorts of different styles and weights in a single typeface, as well as support for many special features and symbols that advanced typography demands.</p>

<p>Therefore, I'd like to define a <em>good font</em> as one that has letterforms that are distinct enough to be told apart, while not so individual that one has trouble reading complete words. In typography, everything's connected to everything, and individual elements can only be noticeable at the expense of the whole---a good font combats this.</p>

<h2>Finding &amp; Acquiring Fonts</h2>

<p>If you want to compare fonts, you need to know where to find them. There's dozens of websites selling (or freely distributing) fonts, as well as large packages of fonts installed by default or by other software. On your computer, there should be an application or program that loads up all your fonts. If you can't find it, though, you can always open a new Word file and look through the list of fonts at the top left.</p>

<p>When it comes to downloading (and/or buying) fonts from websites, you can't really go wrong. There are quite a few huge, trusted websites (e.g. myfonts.com) you can compare and look around, until you find that perfect font. Once downloaded, double-clicking on a font should automatically pop up a window that allows you to install it. From that moment on, you can use it in your projects!</p>

<p>Over time, you'll be able to build your own library of typefaces. Don't rush this process, though---it's better to slowly build your library with typefaces you really like and work well for you, instead of immediately throwing in every free font you can find.</p>

<h2>The Typeface Selection Process</h2>

<p>Design is all about striking a balance between practicality and aesthetics. Your choice of typefaces must first and foremost be governed by the <em>content</em> of the message of text, then the intended audience and purpose, and only lastly by (technical) constraints.</p>

<p>With that said, you can't start a typography without at least one typeface. I also suggest, however, that you don't start a typography with more than a single typeface. This starting typeface should be the one to use for the majority of the text (the <em>body text</em>), as that is the most important to get right, and not the headers or other fancy parts.</p>

<p>The only reason, then, that you should ever add more typefaces is if you really need them. First explore the different weights and styles of the typeface you've already chosen, and you'll notice you don't need so many other typefaces.</p>

<p><strong>Type Error: </strong>In general, more than two or three typefaces is too much</p>

<p>When you do bring in more typeface families, they should fulfil a function your basic family can't, while achieving visual balance with your main font. These extras are called <em>accessories</em>, and, for example, contain bolder and more attention-grabbing letters than the main font, which makes them ideal for headlines. I must warn you though, that some fonts look very nice when set large or small, but are quite ugly when displayed at another size. Next chapter will talk more about the matching of fonts.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Matching Fonts"
  post: "<p>As stated in the previous chapter, there are several things to take into account when looking for fonts. The main concerns are: <em>legibility</em>, <em>economy</em>, <em>medium</em>, <em>history</em> and <em>message</em>. Type is made to be read, but also to be printed on a certain medium and convey a certain message. Additionally, you don't want type to take up more space than necessary, and you also don't want to create conflicting historical associations in your work.</p>

<h2>Workhorses</h2>

<p>I recommend you use a so-called <em>workhorse</em> as your first typeface. A real workhorse is a neutral and "invisible" font that brings focus to the content, to the body text that will be the largest part of most designs.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyWorkhorses.png" /></p>

<p>A workhorse typically has the following properties:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A good regular weight. It shouldn't be so light that it disappears, and not so heavy that letter shapes fill in.</li>
	<li>At least one bold and italic weight, with enough contrast to be noticed. These complement the regular weight.</li>
	<li>It is economical. It should be narrow or small enough to fit large amounts of text within the available space, but the letters shouldn't be compressed beyond recognition.</li>
	<li>It has good numerals. Confusing or misaligned figures are annoying, or maybe even dangerous, when immediate understanding of the numbers is required.</li>
	<li>It has a large array of symbols. We call these fonts <em>expert sets</em>, as they include characters only so-called typographic experts would think about using.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: I don't think any graphic font has ever been able to have those properties, and I suggest you stick to serif or sans-serif typefaces for the workhorse part of the design.</p>

<h2>Similarity &amp; Contrast</h2>

<p>Fonts match well together if they are <em>similar</em> (they are harmonious and look a lot like each other) or <em>contrasted </em>(they are very unlike each other). Choosing a font combination with properties in between will look like a mess or a mistake, rather than a stylistic choice. Similar fonts are great for signalling a subtle change in the hierarchy, such as emphasizing or highlighting a word by setting it in <em>italics</em>. Contrasting fonts are great for important and large difference in hierarchy, such as a heading versus regular body text, or even a logo versus headings.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyTypefacesSimilarityContrast.png" /></p>

<p>Strong similarities among fonts are, among others,</p>

<ul>
	<li>Roughly the same character width.</li>
	<li>Categorized within the same classification</li>
	<li>The same <em>perceived</em> x-height. As stated earlier, some serif fonts swing above and below their x-height with curves and ornamentation, which means picking two fonts with the exact same x-height doesn't necessarily make them look the same size.</li>
	<li>An even texture. This means that the darkness/lightness and the smoothness/roughness of the letterforms are the same</li>
	<li>Roughly the same shape for the letter <em>n</em>. The parts of this letter occur often in the shapes of other letters, which is why comparing the curves of the<em> n</em> can tell you a great deal about whether fonts match visually.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, by contrasting some of these properties instead of choosing them to be similar or identical, you can add more visual interest and balance to a design. The task is, as always, to not overdo this contrast, or you might still end up with an incoherent mess. One thing that doesn't lend itself to contrasting, though, is the <em>x-height</em>---try to keep it the same for different fonts (at the same point size).</p>

<p>A popular combination that always seems to work well, is combining one serif and one sans-serif typeface. A third typeface, if needed at all, could then be one of graphic type. Additionally, typefaces created by the same typographer or in the same time period often go well together.</p>

<h2>Media</h2>

<p>Workhorses work across all media, while other typefaces generally don't. For example, Garamond is a beautiful serif font used very often in printed books, but on a screen it often looks awful or illegible (it's best replaced with the sturdier Georgia). Therefore, you should always pick the fonts that will look their best when put on the final medium.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you shouldn't go against the intended use of a font. When using a digital adaptation of a letterpress face, choose fonts that are faithful  to the spirit as well as letters of old designs. Choose faces that suit the paper you intend to print on, or choose paper that suits the faces you want to use (if you have that freedom). Consider the medium for which a font was originally designed, and don't stray too far from it.</p>

<h2>Message</h2>

<p>When you design the typography for a message, you will always add some interpretation to it. Even if you choose a "neutral" typeface, you've made a choice telling your audience the message is neutral. Brands are a good example of this; they have to be authentic through typeface, and using a bland or overused typefaces carries that same message over to the brand.</p>

<p>Some typefaces are only suitable for some specific occasions, while others are only suitable at a certain time. Typographic trends exist, but they are hard to predict. When trends are followed, the entertainment value is higher than with straightforward corporate stuff, but beware that your design might not stand the test of time.</p>

<p>Most of it, though, has to do with history. Choose faces whose historical associations are in keeping with the text, and don't go against the intended use of a typeface. For example, if I showed you a few fonts, you'd be immediately able to pick out the one that screams "cowboy" or "flower power"---using them in another context will most likely feel strange.</p>

<h2>Fine-tuning</h2>

<p>When you're still not satisfied with a font, you can of course always fine-tune it yourself. You can add your own characters, or modify some of the existing ones. This should, however, be done with great care. And, most importantly, if a font requires too much changes, just drop it and pick a different one. (For now, I haven't created a course on how to design your own fonts, yet. Sorry.)</p>

  title: "[Typography] Font Styles"
  post: "<p>You've seen me mention that different <em>weights</em> or <em>styles</em> of one typeface multiple times, and now I will explain exactly what that means. They are simply variations on the basic idea or structure of a type family, which you can use for signalling changes in the hierarchy and highlighting (or commenting) certain parts of the text.</p>

<p><em>What variations could you possibly make while keeping the basic structure intact</em>? Well, you can make the type lighter or heavier, you can make it narrower or wider, you can make it blockier or rounder, or you can make it more upright or more slanted.</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Exercise:</strong> After reading this chapter, try to create a typographic design with a clear hierarchy using only different font styles from the same typeface.</p>

<h2>Heavy versus Light</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyStylesLightHeavy.png" /></p>

<p>A font is called <em>heavy</em> if its strokes are thicker than the regular version. There are, of course, gradations. When a font is only marginally thicker, it's called <em>semibold</em>. When a font is quite a bit heavier, it's called <em>bold</em>. A font that is extremely heavy is called <em>black</em> or sometimes <em>extrabold</em>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a <em>light</em> font has thinner strokes than the regular version. Because the regular letters are actually quite thin already, fonts usually have at most a single light version.</p>

<p>If there's even more heavy or light versions, however, they are often designated by numbers; <strong>100</strong> being the thinnest, <strong>900</strong> being the thickest. In this case, 400 or 500 is about regular size.</p>

<p>Bold letters have decreased white space, which actually makes them seem smaller than lighter counterparts. This is often countered by making them slightly higher or broader; either way, the counters need to stay clear and open at all sizes.</p>

<p>Light typefaces are best suited for those messages we want to look delicate and elegant. Use them to accentuate rhythm and lend emphasis to other parts of the design, or in pieces of text with a very small size.</p>

<h2>Condensed versus Wide</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyStylesCondensedWide.png" /></p>

<p>Instead of only changing strokes, it's also possible to change dimensions. A font is <em>condensed</em> if its letters are much higher than they are wide. A font is <em>wide</em> if the opposite is true.</p>

<p>Again, gradations are possible, but not often. It's hard to condense or stretch a font without making it look ugly or unreadable, and only <em>expert sets</em> have such well-designed variations.</p>

<p>Sensationalist newspapers or designs usually employ bold, condensed typefaces. This allows them to attract attention, whilst being economical with their available space.</p>

<h2>Upright versus Slanted</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyStylesRomanSlanted.png" /></p>

<p>The default form of letters is (nearly) upright, which we call <em>roman</em>. If the letters in a font are slanted, which means they have a much more diagonal stress, we call them <em>italic</em>. Italics are usually the best way to emphasize or highlight words, as they are less attention-grabbing than heavy typefaces, yet fit better within the flow of the text. In general, pick italic over bold.</p>

<h2>Blocky versus Round</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyStylesBlockyRounded.png" /></p>

<p>Though not as common, some typefaces have different styles that are more radically different. A blocky font has the curves and serifs of the original made more geometric and square. A rounded font has all parts of the letter made more round and curves exaggerated. Rounded fonts are therefore sometimes called <em>soft</em>.</p>

<p>Traditionally, rounded forms seem more playful, happy and fun, while blocky forms are more serious, formal and cool.</p>

<h2>Uppercase versus Lowercase</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyStylesCase.png" /></p>

<p>Though technically not a style, the difference between using only uppercase or only lowercase letters is quite huge. In general, refrain from using uppercase letters only for sentences longer than a single lines. Do not be afraid to use them, though, as they can be great in headlines or highlighting. Nevertheless, within body text, it's best to use <em>small caps</em> instead of fully fledged capitals, as the latter often interrupts the flow too much. Small caps are also recommended for displaying roman numerals.</p>

<h2>A Huge Word of Warning</h2>

<p>The styles I described above, should be <em>separate font files</em>. On the computer, when you want a typeface bold or italic, it will look for the corresponding font file. If it can't find it, however, it will mechanically thicken or slant the letters following a standard algorithm. Don't let this happen to you.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyStylesFake.png" /></p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Error:</strong> Never, ever, distort type or use fake variations.</p>

<p>Instead, find a typeface that naturally supports all the variations you need. This means you shouldn't use fake bolds, fake italics, fake small caps, or fake condensed/wide versions (by distorting the letters yourself).</p>

<p>You could, if needed, make a letter bolder by adding an outline around it yourself. This can actually be used to great effect, as long as they don't intrude with the letterforms---instead, always place them outside of the letter. Because it's so easy to add bold variations to a typeface, there are some fonts that had their "official" bold version added later. Be wary of this, as this is still not the way to go.</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Error:</strong> No, <u>underlined</u> is not a font style, and don't use it when you don't really have to.</p>

<p>Placing text directly over images, or images directly over letters, is not recommended. I'll discuss some ways to eliminate this problem later in the course.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Special Characters I"
  post: "<p>The first computer keyboards were made primarily for programming, which is why proper typographic characters are hard to find or use if you don't know about them. Additionally, good typographic practices concerning some punctuation and special characters aren't taught in school, which is why the information in this chapter is applicable to all branches or activities involving writing.</p>

<p>What's important to remember, though, is that special characters serve mostly as a necessary notation, and should never reduce legibility or functionality. Therefore, remove unnecessary punctuation whenever you can, and only use it to increase aesthetic value if it doesn't compromise the clarity of the design.</p>

<h2>Hyphens and Dashes</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyCharactersDashes.png" /></p>

<p>There are three flavours: <em>hyphens</em>, <em>en dashes</em> and <em>em dashes</em>. The hyphen is the shortest, while the others are the width of the letter <em>n</em> and the letter <em>m</em>, respectively.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The hyphen is used within a compound word, or when a word is broken up at the end of a sentence.</li>
	<li>Close-set en dashes are used to indicate a range of numbers, while en dashes with space around them can be used to make a comment or indicate a subordinate clause in a sentence, essentially taking over the function of the comma.</li>
	<li>Close-set em dashes can also be used as a replacement of the comma, while em dashes with space around them can introduce alternate speakers or quotes in a story.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which character you choose to use for the <em>minus</em> in mathematical notation is up to you, although it's generally recommended to use a wider dash for subtraction, than for negative numbers. If possible, find a font that has special symbols built-in for mathematical operations.</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Error:</strong> Don't use multiple hyphens after each other to simulate dashes.</p>

<h2>Quotes</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyCharactersQuotes.png" /></p>

<p>Again, there are different types to be aware of: <em>straight</em> and <em>curly quotes</em>, and <em>single</em> and <em>double </em>quotes.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use a single straight quote for <em>foot </em>and <em>inch</em> marks.</li>
	<li>Use opening and closing curly quotes for all other cases. When used as an apostrophe, make sure the quote points downward.</li>
	<li>With numerical plurals, omit the apostrophe</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, quotes obstruct the flow of the text and should be used sparingly. It is for that reason that you should default to using only single quotes when quotations are short or inline. However, when used for direct quotation of someone's speech or showing a writer doesn't buy into the meaning of a word, use double quotes.</p>

<h2>Parentheses, Brackets &amp; Braces</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyCharactersParentheses.png" /></p>

<p>Lots of fonts have these characters too thick, too thin, or too symmetrical. Try to use the best version of these characters you can find. Additionally, the spacing isn't always satisfying---there should not be too much space between the letters and the parentheses, nor too little.</p>

<p>If the text within parentheses is italic (or otherwise styled), it's generally best to keep them upright and normal. That is, unless this causes letters to collide with the parentheses.</p>

<p>As for their usage, parentheses are the most common, while brackets and braces are mostly for programming or scientific pieces.</p>

<h2>Diacritics &amp; Symbols</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyCharactersDiacritics.png" /></p>

<p>Diacritics, just as fake bolds, can be simulated by computers. As expected, it's recommended to choose a font with naturally supported diacritics instead. Either way, don't leave out diacritics, as lots of languages depend on them for their meaning. (For example, <em>papa</em> is father in Spanish, while <em>pap&aacute;</em> is a potato.)</p>

<p>Typical other symbols that are poorly designed in (non-professional) fonts are parentheses, brackets, asterisk, pilcrow (paragraph mark), section sign, and the octothorp (hashtag). You can alter them yourself if you like, but it's much easier to choose a typeface that naturally supports these properly.</p>

<h2>Ending Sentences</h2>

<p>Ending sentences with a regular dot will suffice most of the time. You can explore, however, rewriting a sentence to become a question, as this makes it shorter and more active.</p>

> "<em>I will now try to explain why you shouldn't do A but B</em>" can be rewritten to "<em>Why should you do B instead of A?</em>"

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Error:</strong> Never, ever, use multiple exclamation or question marks after each other. In fact, avoid using exclamation marks if you can.</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Error:</strong> Never use two spaces after a period. It's unnecessary and disrupts the flow of the text.</p>

<p>There's another common problem, which is: <em>should punctuation come before or after the dot?</em> In general, it doesn't really matter, as long as you're consistent with your choice. Putting the punctuation in front of the ending dot seems more logical, but positioning it after the dot is often more visually pleasing.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Special Characters II"
  post: "<p>Continuing on last chapter, I will discuss a very important special character: <em>figures </em>or <em>numerals</em>. At the end, I will also include some simple left-over rules on special characters, which are nevertheless quite important to know!</p>

<h2>Figures</h2>

<p>Much like a proper font always has uppercase and lowercase variations of the exact same letter, good fonts should have multiple versions of the same numeral. Two styles are available: <em>lining</em> and <em>old style</em>.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyFigures.png" /></p>

<h3>Lining Figures</h3>

<p>These are the figures usually linked up with the 0---9 keys on your keyboard. They are called this way, because the top and bottom ends of all numerals line up. In other words, these are the uppercase characters of the numerals---all of them have the same height as the cap height of the font. An alternative name is <em>titling figures</em>.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, these should be used in phrases with all caps.</p>

<h3>Old Style Figures</h3>

<p>As opposed to lining figures, these are designed to look like lowercase letters. They have descenders and ascenders, and in general fit in with the lowercase letters of the font.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly (again), these figures should be used among lowercase text.</p>

<h3>Tabular Figures</h3>

<p>Both lining and old style figures can be either <em>tabular</em> or <em>proportional</em>. In the first case, every figure has the exact same width (like a monospaced font), while in the second case each figure is sized proportionately to its shape.</p>

<p>As the name suggest, tabular figures are best to use in tables or spreadsheets, or any visualization of a large set of data, while proportional figures work best in most other cases.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyCharactersMisc.png" /></p>

<p>Don't use an ampersand (&amp;) in place of a simple <em>and</em>. Instead, reserve them for titles, headlines and proper names. In these cases, choose the best and most beautiful ampersand you can find.</p>

<p>Don't use <em>TM </em>or <em>(c) </em>or anything like that for copyright and trademark symbols. Use the proper symbols, &copy; and &trade;.</p>

<p>Instead of putting three dots after each other, use <em>ellipses</em>.</p>

<p>Use the <em>virgule</em> (steep slash) with words and dates, and the <em>solidus</em> (more diagonal slash) with split-level fractions.</p>

<p>Use a native dimension sign (a cross mark) instead of the lowercase letter <em>x</em> when dimensions are given.</p>

<p>When people still did inscriptions, it was common to use a <em>midpoint</em> (a dot, but slightly higher) between pieces of text to separate them, instead of a space or other character. For short pieces of text, it is actually still very useful.</p>

<p>And last but not least, if you're getting serious about typography, you might find it useful to remap your keyboard driver. Lots of useful and necessary symbols are buried far within the keyboard, and by setting your own (hot)keys you can make your life a lot easier.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Kerning & Tracking"
  post: "<p>Now that we've looked at all individual letterforms and special characters you have at your disposal, we can look at combining them into pairs of letters and ultimately words and sentences.</p>

<h2>Kerning</h2>

<p>Ironically, when letters are spaced out uniformly, their pattern isn't uniform enough. Some combinations of letters leave too much space between them, while others could actually do with a bit more space. The process of setting an alternative spacing between a specific combination of letters, is called <em>kerning</em>. Every good font has it, and you should use it.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyKerning.png" /></p>

<p>The results of such a kerning process is saved in a kerning table, included within the font. This kerning table will most likely be enabled by default, but you can turn it off or go in and change some of the values if you want. Tinkering a bit with the default kerning values is probably only needed when text becomes extremely large, as that is when tiny spacing issues become most apparent.</p>

<p>In general, fonts should have consistent and moderate kerning, or none at all.</p>

<h2>Tracking</h2>

<p>On top of kerning, you can set the amount of space between <em>every</em> pair of letters, which we call <em>tracking</em> or letter-spacing. By default, a letterform will be saved inside a font with a sliver of space around it, which we call the set width. This means a tracking value of 0 should just prevent your letters from touching each other.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyTracking.png" /></p>

<p>By increasing the value, you add more room to breathe, but you also run the risk of letters becoming too individual and seemingly unrelated. It becomes difficult to comprehend words. The smaller the type, the more space is needed. Only big, robust headlines can support closely spaced letters</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Error:</strong> "One who would letterspace lowercase, would steal sheep."</p>

<p>Only use alternative tracking for uppercase and small caps, or really bold and thick titles that create conflicting letterforms. In this case, <strong>5%---12%</strong> letterspacing is optimal. Especially abbreviations and acronyms in the midst of normal text benefit from spaced small caps.</p>

<p>Either way, make the shoe fit, not the foot. If you want to save space, don't apply negative tracking; use the proper (condensed, or lighter) style of the typeface.</p>

<p>Last tip: don't add space within strings of initials, or any sequence of capitals separated by dots really.</p>

<h2>Ligatures</h2>

<p>In some cases of conflicting letterforms, there is no benefit to be gained from kerning. Too much space would need to be added between the letters, creating weird gaps in the text. In those cases, <em>ligatures </em>come to the rescue.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyLigatures.png" /></p>

<p>A ligature is simply a combination of two letters created as a single symbol. It's a way of combining annoying colliding characters in an elegant way. One of the most common ligatures is when an <em>f</em> and <em>i </em>are combined. Without extra space, the dot would intersect with the top curve of the f, so the best solution is to create a special symbol for the two together. A good font has ligatures---use them (if they are not already automatically used by your software).</p>

<p>If you want to avoid using ligatures, pick a font that doesn't need them altogether. Such fonts have their letters designed in such a way that they never collide, so there's often no need for ligatures (or even kerning and tracking). This does, however, often take its toll on the beauty and dynamics of the font.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Leading & Measure"
  post: "<p>Having talked about the space between letters, we can look at the horizontal space between words and vertical space between subsequent lines of text. Ultimately, this allows us to say some clever things about the dimensions of text blocks.</p>

<h2>Measure</h2>

<p>When we talk about the measure of text, we talk about the actual <em>line width</em>. This is influenced by, beside kerning and tracking, the <em>line length</em> (amount of characters on a single line) and the <em>word spacing</em> (white space between words). If the measure is too long, people lose track of where they are and don't have as many pauses when reading. If the measure is too short, lines and words feel unconnected and text blocks become way too long (vertically).</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyMeasure.png" /></p>

<p>In general, a line length of about <strong>45---75 characters</strong> is recommended, whereas a length of <strong>66 characters</strong> is often seen as ideal. If you have lots of horizontal space within the design, however, you could bump up the character count a bit towards a maximum of <strong>90 characters</strong>. If you're working with multiple columns, which is highly recommended, you can use optimal line lengths of <strong>40---50  characters</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyWordSpacing.png" /></p>

<p>All of these estimates are given for when you use the regular amount of word spacing. As a rule of thumb, many designers use the width of the lowercase letter <strong>i</strong> as the word spacing. This is, however, only useful for short pieces of text. In long text blocks, word spaces need to be larger, which also means that line length should be shorter to not make the measure too long. Additionally, bold fonts often need more word spacing.</p>

<p>Therefore, another way to look at it, is that an optimal measure is about <strong>3---5 inches</strong>.</p>

<p>The main issue with measure, is that letters need to be far enough apart to be distinct, but not so far they become unrelated. Word spaces need to identify individual words, but at the same time also group them together for logical sentences. Give your text room to breathe, but don't let it break into a bunch of individual words.</p>

<h2>Leading</h2>

<p>Now that we've discussed the horizontal size of a line, we will look at the vertical size. This is called line height or <em>leading</em>. When the descenders of one line touch or collide with the ascenders of the next line, things get messy and uncomfortable. Therefore, the height of a line is usually not simply the maximum height of its letters, but also includes some extra white space.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyLeading.png" /></p>

<p>In most layouts, leading is slightly greater than cap height. This means setting it to the type size plus <strong>1---4 points</strong>, or setting it to <strong>120%---150% </strong>of the regular body text size.</p>

<p>Leading and measure, however, directly influence each other. The greater the width of a line, the greater the line height should be. If line height is larger than word spacing, it causes the reader to constantly jump to the next line on accident. Don't make the leading too large, though, as it causes the lines to read as separate paragraphs or standalone pieces of text.</p>

<p>If you want to keep a reader's attention, make sure the text has an even and coherent texture. Again, columns can help you out here.</p>

<h2>Combining our Knowledge</h2>

<p>Essentially, we've now learned to approach short and long texts differently.</p>

<p>Long texts need to be comfortable, and once you found your rhythm, nothing must disturb you again. Design it so that the reader has a chance to settle in, but be generous enough with leading to prevent the eye from slipping to the next line before finishing the current line. The reader must be relaxed; the spacing parameters need to be consistent or at least rhythmic (adding and removing space in regular intervals). Long text blocks often require a neutral and inconspicuous typeface.</p>

<p>Short texts are mostly for quick scanning and grabbing attention. Tracking can be tighter, word spaces and line height smaller. The font used should have a little verve, but not too much. </p>

<h2>Hyphenation</h2>

<p>One problem still remains, though, which is that we can't force lines to a certain length. Words can't be broken at random points, as it makes them illegible. For this, <em>hyphenation</em> was invented. You could choose to not break words, and create lines of varying width, but that often results in nothing but an unorganized design. By splitting words at syllables, and adding a hyphen to show they have been split up, text becomes more consistent and easier to read.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyHyphenation.png" /></p>

<p>Here are some guidelines on hyphenation:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Leave at least two characters behind, and take at least three forward.</li>
	<li>Avoid leaving only the last syllable of a hyphenated word, or any word shorter than four letters, as the last line of a paragraph. If at all possible, it's recommended to make the last line at least half the measure of the text block.</li>
	<li>Avoid more than three consecutive hyphenated lines</li>
	<li>Don't hyphenate (short) numerical and mathematical expressions. In fact, don't let them go over a line break at all.</li>
	<li>Avoid hyphenated breaks where text is interrupted by other design elements.</li>
	<li>Hyphenate proper names only as a last resort, unless they appear quite often in your text.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Monospaced Fonts</h2>

<p>Proportionally spaced typefaces are preferred over monospaced. There are only three reasons to still use monospaced fonts: to imitate the historic and personal look of typewriters, to write plain emails, and most of all to write code. The same is true with bitmap fonts; use them only when the theme is computers or anything digital, or when it's necessary because of extremely low-resolution screens.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Alignment"
  post: "<p>Now that we know how to distribute the space within a text block to optimize readability and aesthetics, we can look at aligning the text for the same reasons. Design always benefits from strong lines, and that is no different with typography; it's generally wise to create as many even and straight edges within the design as possible.</p>

<p>Typographic elements can be aligned <em>horizontally</em> or <em>vertically</em>. The most important is horizontal alignment, which has four different types: <em>flush left</em>, <em>flush right</em>, <em>centred</em> and <em>justified</em>.</p>

<h2>Flush Left</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyAlignmentFlushLeft.png" /></p>

<p>Flush left has a hard edge on the left, and a soft one on the right. This means that every sentence starts at the exact same position on the left, but ends at different positions on the right. It's the most popular form of alignment, and in a sense the most logical one for people reading left to right. The uneven edge at the right is called a <em>rag</em>, which is why we also call this alignment <em>ragged right</em>.</p>

<p>The good thing is that it respects organic flow of the language and avoids uneven spacing between words. The bad thing is that it can be disgraced with a "bad rag"---an ugly wedge-like shape for the rag.</p>

<h2>Flush Right</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyAlignmentFlushRight.png" /></p>

<p>Flush right has a hard edge on the right, and a soft one on the left. This means it can also be called <em>ragged left</em>. It's a welcome departure from the familiar flush left, and ideal for captions, sidebars, and marginal notes, with the same benefits as flush left added to it. It can place related elements near each other without letting them interfere.</p>

<p>The bad thing is that some readers might not be pleased by the flush right alignment, and large pieces of flush right can be hard to read for the untrained eye. Bad rags threaten this type of alignment as well, with the added problem that punctuation at the ends of lines can weaken the hard right edge. One solution to this problem is to let any punctuation hang in the margin.</p>

<h2>Centred</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyAlignmentCentred.png" /></p>

<p>Instead of pushing the start or end of lines to the left or right, one can align lines of text along the same main axis. Centred alignment means that all lines share the same centre, which means uneven lines cause a rag on both sides.</p>

<p>It's formal an classical, bearing associations with history and tradition. It breaks a text out of its flow and creates an organic shape. The bad thing is that it's static and conventional. When used too much or carelessly, it looks dull and sad. I recommend never using centred alignment ever again, especially not for text longer than a single line, unless you really have to.</p>

<h2>Justified</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyAlignmentJustified.png" /></p>

<p>In justified alignment, both the left and right edges are hard. This creates a very clean, even and uniform shape, that's also extremely efficient, which is why it's the norm for newspapers and books.</p>

<p>To force the lines into the same measure, however, word spacing is added or removed. This creates ugly gaps, which you never want. This can be avoided by making the line length long enough (in relation to the size of the type), as more words allows word spacing to be changed more subtly.</p>

<p>The best solution, however, is hyphenation. With right and centre alignments, hyphenation can be considered a deadly sin. With flush left alignment, it's okay. With justified alignment, it's a blessing.</p>

<p>The take away is: use flush right alignment more often, and choose flush left or justified for the rest of the text; there's no performance difference between the two. Centred alignment should be restricted to single lines or titles.</p>

<h2>Vertical Alignment</h2>

<p>Vertical alignment within regular text blocks is already taken care of by the fact that lines sit on a common baseline. There are times, however, when you want to stack multiple letters on top of each other or align a phrase to a vertical baseline. There are two ways to do this.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyVerticalAlignment.png" /></p>

<p><em>Stacked Capitals</em>: Use capital, roman letters on top of each other. Centring this column helps even out the differences in width. Also, pick a font where the capital letter <strong>I </strong>is not too narrow.</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Error:</strong> Don't stack lowercase. It's awkward, because ascenders and descenders make vertical spacing uneven and unbalanced.</p>

<p><em>Vertical Baselines</em>: Simply write the phrase like you normally would, and then rotate the whole element by 90 degrees. This preserves the natural affinity and texture of lowercase letters. It can run from top to bottom or bottom top, which is both fine.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Paragraphs & Pagination"
  post: "<p>Thus far we've handled text as if it were bundled in huge so-called <em>text blocks</em>, based on the topic or function. While that is true, in general, for typographic projects, there's much more to structuring text than that. This chapter will look at the main ways of subdividing large typographic projects, which is breaking it down into paragraphs, and putting it on separate pages.</p>

<h2>Paragraphs</h2>

<p>Paragraphs are a literary convention, designed to divide content into smaller portions that are easier to take in. The places where a paragraph ends and begins should therefore be clear, but paragraphs should not be so distinct that the story within them breaks apart.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyParagraphs.png" /></p>

<p>Traditionally, two common ways to mark the start of a paragraph exist. The first is to <em>indent</em> the first line by about <strong>1---4 </strong>times the <strong>point size</strong>. The second is to leave <em>vertical white space</em> of about <strong>4---10 points</strong> above the paragraph. You could do both to be certain that a new paragraph is picked up on, but it's generally recommended to stick with one.</p>

<p>The first paragraph of any chapter or text block, however, should <em>never</em> be indented. The first paragraph already stands apart on its own, and indenting only adds confusion.</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Error:</strong> "The first word of the first line is <em>the</em> critical word of that particular body of text. Let it start flush, at least."</p>

<p>A less common way to separate pieces of text---not necessarily restricted to paragraphs---is by the use of so-called <em>fleurons</em>. These are simple typographic ornaments or symbols that mark the beginning or resumption of a section.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, don't use multiple spaces or other special characters in a row to achieve a certain effect. Adding a line break or starting a new text block reliably and controllably makes text start on a new line, adding lots of spaces after each other does not. Also, don't start more than two consecutive lines with the same word (although this is partly a writer's issue).</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Exercise: </strong>Invent new ways to separate paragraphs!</p>

<h2>Pagination</h2>

<p>How you distribute your works on pages doesn't have much general rules, except for the fact that you want pages to be balanced and feel connected. Most pages are displayed side by side, and having a huge difference in the amount of content confuses the reader. You can balance this by moving single lines from one page to the other, and, of course, having a good overall typographic design.</p>

<p>To make pages feel connected, and create more beautiful overall page aesthetics, it's often best to eliminate <em>widows</em> and <em>orphans</em>.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyOrphansWidows.png" /></p>

<p>A widow is when the last line of a paragraph appears at the top of the next page. To solve this, either move more lines to the next page, or rewrite the paragraph to be shorter.</p>

<p>An orphan is when only the first line of a paragraph appears at the bottom of a page (and the rest of it at the top of the next page). To solve this, simply move this single line down to the next page.</p>

<p>Whether you do something about these widows and orphans is up to you, though, as removing them can leave weird gaps of space.</p>

<h2>Webpages</h2>

<p>Webpages can't work with multiple pages. Instead, they are often dynamic, and heavily extend in width and height. Of course, one solution is to break your content into multiple pages yourself, and if your articles become extremely long it's actually recommended to do that. In those cases, the same rules apply as described above.</p>

<p>In most cases, though, you will have to work with extremely large pages. It is for that reason that you should have a consistent and clear typographic design on the website, and a clear navigation and hierarchy, otherwise the user gets <em>lost in content</em>. More on that later.</p>

<h2>Block Quotes</h2>

<p>Before we move on to the bigger picture, I have one special text block to talk about here; quotations. I'll discuss three types: <em>inline quotations</em>, <em>block quotes</em>, <em>verse quotations</em>.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyQuotations.png" /></p>

<p>Inline quotations have only one rule: if a piece of text starts with a quotation, you should always include the initial quotation mark. The usage of quotes is discussed in the special characters chapter, while the notation for quotations is dependent on the style of the writer.</p>

<p>Block quotes have more to them than that. A block quotation is used when citing at most three sentences from an external source. They should be formatted to make clear that the text is not the author's. Here are the rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Add extra leading before and after block quotations.</li>
	<li>Indent them subtly, about <strong>0.5---1 inch</strong>.</li>
	<li>If you decide to add quotation marks at the ends, let them hang in the margin to not disturb the even edges.</li>
	<li>Subtly reduce font size and line height.</li>
</ul>

<p>Verse quotations have short lines, sometimes without much or any punctuation. It's best to indent them by quite a bit, or centre them (if they aren't too long).</p>

  title: "[Typography] Hierarchy I"
  post: "<p>I've already mentioned emphasizing and hierarchy several times, but now is the moment we can finally take a good look at it. Hierarchy is one of the most important aspects of any typographic design; if we don't know where to start, if we don't know the importance of each piece of text, if we don't understand the message or information, the design has failed. Hierarchy is all about clarifying the level of importance of a certain text block, and establishing connections and relationships between different pieces of information. It can be established in many, many ways, and this chapter will look at some of the key concepts.</p>

<h2>Contrast</h2>

<p>Difference among elements is created with contrast. One or multiple visual <em>cues</em> must signal the user that a change in hierarchy is happening. There are a lot of ways to do this, but some of them aren't really part of typography, so I will only mention typographic contrasts here.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyContrastModes.png" /></p>

<p>The general options for creating contrast are</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Size</strong>: The most obvious one, visually and structurally, which I will discuss thoroughly in the next sections.</li>
	<li><strong>Style</strong>: A change from one style to another, such as switching from regular text to boldface, is a great and common visual cue.</li>
	<li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Text blocks or phrases that are aligned differently automatically feel like they are acting together on a different level.</li>
	<li><strong>Direction</strong>: With this I refer to the general direction or dimensions of a text block. For example, body text might be put in a wide rectangular field, while a narrow column beside it might contain notes or remarks.</li>
	<li><strong>Colour:</strong> A change in colour can be very noticeable, or not at all, depending on the style and size of the text. Colour can also increase or decrease the importance of a piece of text, depending partly on the context. Read more about this in the <strong><em>COLOUR THEORY</em></strong> course.</li>
	<li><strong>Space</strong>: Indenting or adding more space around text blocks provides a way to set them off from the elements around it.</li>
	<li><strong>Placement:</strong> Readers expect headings to be at the top, for example, while text blocks pushed against the edges of the paper seem of lesser importance or an afterthought.</li>
	<li><strong>Texture:</strong> You can change the texture of a piece of text by choosing a different typeface altogether, or changing the case (as lowercase has more texture than uppercase). Whether this increases importance and attracts attention depends on the properties of this added typeface.</li>
	<li><strong>Form:</strong> The outer form of a text block (e.g. rectangular, circular, trapezoid, and so on) also provides a strong visual cue that differentiates between content. This is hard to achieve without compromising legibility, though.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, there's a lot of cues, and they can be used in near infinite amount of combinations. It's therefore recommended to never use too many signals---more than three cues is usually too much. Multiple cues should only provide backup for each other; a single subtle shift should be enough to establish hierarchy for the focused reader.</p>

<p>Because of this, it's recommended to change one parameter at a time when trying to establish your hierarchy. If you immediately assign three cues to every level of hierarchy, you'll clutter the foreground and waste time and space on something you don't need.</p>

<h2>Common Structures</h2>

<p>While you can design the hierarchy any way you want, there's a common structure that works well and everybody's familiar with. This structure is something along the lines of:</p>

> Title => Chapter => Heading => Subheading => Body Text => Notes => Structural Elements

<p><img src="media/TypographyCommonHierarchy.png" /></p>

<p>The title is the shortest, but also often the biggest and most obvious element on the page. When people see a page, they need to immediately be able to scan the title to see what it is or if it's what they were looking for.</p>

<p>From there on you can have multiple levels of headings (depending on how your content is structured), which all need to be visually distinct from each other, yet make clear that they are a heading. Use as many headings as you need; no more and no fewer. If your content has only one header or maybe none at all, go with that and don't invent headers.</p>

<p>Only then comes the body text, which is relatively small in font size and doesn't have much other contrast applied, as it makes the text (more often than not) hard to read. A separate level is also used for notes or asides that talk about the body text, but aren't important enough to be within the body text.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have the structural or navigational elements, such as page numbers, or a phrase in the margin that states your current location within a book. These should never be in view as the user is reading, but if he needs to go somewhere else, they should be easy to find and understand.</p>

<h2>Font Size</h2>

<p>The best way to start with creating your hierarchy, is by determining the fonts and font sizes for each particular level. We've already talked about matching fonts, to a maximum of about three, and never using a font you don't need. When it comes to font sizes, you usually require more variety and bigger contrasts between the different sizes.</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Error:</strong> Never use only one font size for a complete typographic design.</p>

<p>Font size should be determined with a <em>scale</em>. Which scale you use is up to you, but you should never arbitrarily pick sizes. By using a scale, such as multiplying font size by <em>1.618</em> (golden ratio) for every higher level of the hierarchy, you establish a pattern and rhythm, while keeping an adequate amount of contrast (as too little difference in font size will make it seem like you made a mistake).</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographySizeHierarchy.png" /></p>

<p>The best font size for body text in print is <strong>10---12 points</strong>, and for the web it's <strong>15---25 pixels</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Why is the recommended size for web larger?</em> Because the web is different. We usually view webpages from a greater distance, on a bigger screen. Webpages are huge projects with extra (interactive and dynamic) things added to it and scrolling ability.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Hierarchy II"
  post: "<p>Last chapter introduced the common hierarchy used in most projects, and now we will look at a few of them more intensively.</p>

<h2>Title Pages</h2>

<p>The title page is the first thing most readers will see, and should stand out yet be simple and clear. When it comes to the title page of a complete work, you have a lot of freedom and should simply set it in a style that contributes to the overall design, and conveys the right message and tone. Additionally, there should be some space (empty pages) after the title page to set it apart from the rest of the work.</p>

<p>For the same reason, multiple nearly-empty pages should be left at the end of a book to balance it out and not come to an abrupt stop. When adding preliminaries, which is always a fun thing to do, give them adequate space as well.</p>

<p>When it comes to title pages for chapters or certain levels of the hierarchy, set them in a form that works together with the overall design. If headers stand out or contrast too much, it distracts from the all-important body text. Don't let the title page oppress the text, but make it a symbol of the importance and presence of the text.</p>

<h2>Highlighting</h2>

<p>When it comes to the body text, there's always very subtle changes in hierarchy to be made. Perhaps you want to emphasize a single word in a phrase, or a single phrase within a long piece of text. The visual cues for these changes should not be so subtle that you can't immediately spot them, but it's also no good when lots of visual cues add up inside a text block.</p>

<p>Therefore, highlight no more than 10 percent of the text, as the effects of highlighting decrease as the amount increases. Use only a small number of techniques, but apply them rigorously and consistently.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyHighlighting.png" /></p>

<p>Italics should be preferred, especially for longer phrases, as they fit with the flow of the text. Bolding is the next best option, as it is more detectable or legible. Underlining should be avoided, and reserved for hyperlinks on the web.</p>

<p>Avoid using different typefaces as a highlighting technique, and also avoid making text blink. Adding animation to text can be a wonderful thing, but it should not be annoying, and there should be an option to turn it off.</p>

<p>When it comes to colour, highlighting with very bright colours is actually not recommended. They attract too much attention; a shift in colour is already enough. Highlight using desaturated colours which are clearly distinct.</p>

<p>Inversing elements works extremely well for text, and is underused in my opinion. It's effective at attracting attention, but adds considerable noise. It doesn't work that well with icons or shapes, though.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Notes can be anything; a remark about the body text, a complete paragraph with additional information, or a footnote/reference. However, the traditional way of adding notes---at the bottom or top of the page---is actually the worst one. We're used to reading top to bottom, and notes interfere too much this way.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyNotesHeads.png" /></p>

<p>A better way, is adding the notes in the margin, and perhaps adding footnotes and references as a long list at the end. If you are to use superscripts of any kind within the text, check their weight and spacing, as to not attract too much or too little attention towards them. In the notes themselves, though, always use full-size numbers. And, as always, be consistent.</p>

<p>Another name for adding the notes in the margin is <em>shoulder </em>or <em>run-in heads</em>, which gives us another opportunity here: adding the heading or title of the current section in the margin works wonders as well.</p>

<h2>Alternate Hierarchies</h2>

<p>With the rise of the web, it's become common practice for people to use your work on many different devices. Additionally, visually impaired users might make use of a screen reader to read your work aloud to them.</p>

<p>Therefore, the underlying structure of a design is perhaps more important than the final look. Even on the web, it's important to establish a proper hierarchy <em>before</em> making up any visual ornamentation or extras. If the underlying hierarchy works well, it can easily be adapted to different devices/screen sizes or use cases, and it can be used by the widest possible range of users.</p>

<p>For websites, this usually means a single, proper HTML structure and several CSS style sheets for different screen dimensions. For screen readers (and, well, readers in general) you should still caption your tables, add "alt tags" ( = descriptions) to images, place the navigation at the right spots, make it clear that it's the navigation, and provide a descriptive title for hyperlinks.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Grid"
  post: "<p>Having started at the smallest parts of typography, it's now time to look at the big picture; the overall design filling up the whole page (or any other medium you happen to be using). Because it can be quite a daunting task to fill lots of pages with lots of content, designers usually employ a <em>grid</em>.</p>

<p>A grid is nothing more than a subdivision of the design area, following a regular pattern. This might seem like the typography will become too mechanical and "perfect", but the infinite ways through which you can subdivide and fill in the grid prevent this from happening. The grid should not force you to design the page in a certain way, instead, you should use it as a tool that shows ideas for great placement and dimensions for blocks of text.</p>

<h2>Single Column</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyGridSingleColumn.png" /></p>

<p>The simplest possible grid is the <strong>single column</strong>. This column can be centred, leaving equal margins at all sides. This is highly economical, but also boring. As books and magazines have pages next to each other when opened, you should always design pages as <em>spreads </em>too. You can mirror these pages to balance them out, which also allows you to vary the sizes of the inner and outer margins. Asymmetric designs, however, can be very interesting if you manage to balance the pages with other contrasts.</p>

<p>On the computer, software usually asks you about page dimensions and margin width at the start, encouraging you to design from the <em>outside in</em>. If you're looking for inspiration, however, it's better to design from the <em>inside out</em>: design the margins and column(s) as if the page was infinitely large, experiment with them, and only add those guidelines to all pages when you've found your holy grail.</p>

<h2>Multi-Column</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyGridMultiColumn.png" /></p>

<p>There are many ways to create a <strong>multicolumn</strong> grid. By laying down horizontal and vertical grid lines using a certain pattern, you can create horizontal and vertical zones. Some of them can be filled with content, others should be left empty to keep the balance. The finer your grid, the more flexibility you have.</p>

<p>A common application of the multicolumn grid is when text and images are to be displayed together. You could split them and put them into separate columns, or put the text in separate columns and let the images flow together with them. You could reserve a vertical area for captions and notes, while the body text "hangs" from a common horizontal line.</p>

<p>How you create the grid, and how you use it, is your choice, but also determined largely by the content. Adding lots of different zones when there's nothing but body text to display, is overkill and unnecessary. If the contents, illustrations and amount of copy vary, however, a flexible grid is needed.</p>

<h2>Modular</h2>

<p><img src="media/TypographyGridModular.png" /></p>

<p>While regular grids simply draw horizontal and vertical lines, which automatically divide the page, modular grids work with <em>modules</em>. A module is nothing more than a rectangle that contains one type of content; there's no subdivision within it. By placing evenly spaced out modules of different sizes you create a varied and asymmetric grid, while automatically leaving the necessary space around elements. Overlaying multiple layers of modules can generate even more complex grids, but that often isn't necessary.</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Exercise:</strong> Pick a simple modular grid and arrange the layout in as many ways as you can imagine. If you feel adventurous, include more variables (orientation, alignment, weight, size, colour, and so on).</p>

<h2>Proportions</h2>

<p>As always, it's best to work with a scale. In this case, that doesn't only mean keeping a fixed proportion for the distance between and size of text blocks, but also keeping that proportional relationship with the rest of the type. If your font size has to follow a certain scale, it's wise to start out with a grid following that same scale. Often, it happens to look amazing. If not, you can try some other scale or tinker with the original.</p>

<p>This certainly doesn't mean, though, that you should stick to the rules always and ever. In fact, improvising and experimenting yields the best results. If you have a sudden feeling about something, try it out. First calculate the optimal settings for something, but discard them if it doesn't work out. The best grid is one that shows you what to do when you've lost track; it hides itself to give attention to the content and aesthetics of the design, but it presents itself when structure is needed.</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Exercise:</strong> Determine a small set of simple, fixed rules for yourself. Then, try to create a wide range of different visual solutions keeping yourself to those constraints.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Page"
  post: "<p>Having a grid is great for dividing the page into different sections, but not everything works equally well. People are accustomed to a certain standard page layout and reading direction, and if you want long pieces of text to be easily read it's best to follow those guidelines. It's not that you can't go wild with extravagant grids, it's that you should reserve that for title pages and places that don't require long reading.</p>

<h2>Page Dimensions</h2>

<p>The outer dimensions of any typographic work play an important role. They define the shape of the grid, and frame the design in a very strong way. It's therefore recommended to not just pick a stock size or arbitrary shape for your design, but to choose page proportions that are satisfying and suitable to the message of the content.</p>

<p>A large amount of content requires a larger page, or you'll be left with thousands of pages. A traditional layout requires a page that is longer than it is wide, while modern designs tend to have more horizontal shapes. A design with only square text blocks would do well with a perfectly square page. Take all of these factors into account when actively choosing your page dimensions.</p>

<p>When it comes to books, size is crucial---stuff for serious reading should fit in our hands. Font size should be no smaller than 9 point, and no larger than 14 point. Typefaces with a very pronounced or very small x-height are not your best bet.</p>

<h2>Margins</h2>

<p>It's perfectly possible, however, that you don't know the exact size at which a design is going to be viewed. While you perhaps can't predict the maximum size (such as the size of a user's screen, or the size of the paper used for the final printing), you <em>do</em> fully control how much space you want to take up.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyPageMargins.png" /></p>

<p>For this, we have the <em>margins</em>. Margins solve a multitude of problems;</p>

<ul>
	<li>They set off text from the edges of the paper, making it more readable and giving the design more room to breathe</li>
	<li>They create a "safe zone". If the final dimensions of the work turn out differently than expected, margins make sure none of the important information is cut off, and that the design is still intact.</li>
	<li>They create room for notes and other messages connected to the body text, but on a separate level in the hierarchy. This doesn't just mean remarks or references, this also includes things such as page numbers or displaying the current chapter you're reading at the top of every page.</li>
	<li>They balance and contrast the page by creating as much (near) empty spots as there are spots full of text or design elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Actively include the margins as you design, from start to finish, and you will notice improvements in your typography. Be aware, though, that you don't clutter the design by putting too much in the margins. You don't need to fill every header, footer and aside with extra information; an interested reader knows what chapter or section he's at and doesn't need constant reminding.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can choose to hang punctuation and ornamentation (such as quotes and drop caps) into the margin, to keep the edges of text blocks even. Sometimes it works very well, sometimes it doesn't, depending on the context.</p>

<h2>Space</h2>

<p>Besides adding space at the edges of the frame, there's also the necessary amount of space to add between text blocks. These so-called <em>gutters</em> are usually an automatic result of using a proper grid, but there's still some things to watch out for.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyPageSpace.png" /></p>

<p>There are two main reasons a typographic design needs space: to set it off from other elements (to make it more readable), and to lead the user through the design. If everything's connected to everything, the reader doesn't know where to go. If you leave a lot of space between elements, you make clear that these are unrelated, while if you leave little space, elements suddenly become a group. Similarly, if you align elements along a common line in space, this line can be followed by the user.</p>

<p>Because we read from top to bottom, text is still best set in columns that are clearly taller than they are wide, and as a result, space usually takes the form of columns as well. Columns provide a way to put a lot of information on a page, which is economical <em>and</em> increases comprehension of the information, while at the same time leaving ample room for space. Creating too much white space makes it impossible for the user to quickly find content or establish relationships between paragraphs, as there's seas of space between all elements.</p>

<p>In short, use scales to set the proportions of your text blocks (and perhaps page dimensions), but create space freely and in abundance, first and foremost shaped as columns.</p>

<h2>Gutenberg Diagram</h2>

<p>The <em>Gutenberg Diagram</em> is an image that shows the general direction in which a reader's eyes scan or read a page. It's very useful in determining where you should place your most important content, so that it's the first thing users see. This diagram, however, is mostly true for design with information evenly distributed across the page. It can always be overruled if you add enough contrast or emphasis somewhere else. The diagram looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyGutenbergDiagram.png" /></p>

<p>Western readers naturally start top left, and move across and down in a series of sweeps until they reach bottom right. Each of these sweeps begins along an axis of orientation---a horizontal line created by aligned elements---and proceeds in left-to-right direction.</p>

<p>The fallow areas receive the least attention, unless visually emphasized. This tendency is called <em>reading gravity</em>, and designs that follow it often improve reading rhythm and comprehension.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Design Elements"
  post: "<p>This course has mainly talked about text blocks, which the majority of every typographic design consists of, but there are some other special design elements that require further investigation. I'm talking about: <em>tables</em>, <em>lists</em>, <em>images</em>, and <em>forms</em>.</p>

<h2>Tables</h2>

<p>Tables (and Graphs) are like grids within grids. You might use a certain grid for the overall page design, but a table is too fine-grained to fit within that large grid. Instead, you have one of the hardest tasks imaginable: you need to make a large set of numbers or data interesting and understandable, while at the same time keeping the table consistent with the overall layout.</p>

<p>Luckily, I have some guidelines for you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Always set all text horizontal.</li>
	<li>Letterforms that are too small or condensed may <em>not</em> be used to save space</li>
	<li>A minimum amount of "furniture"---such as rules, boxes, and dots---should be used. This allows for a maximum amount of information, and makes it easier to establish relationships between data.</li>
	<li>Rules, tint blocks, or other guides and dividers, if you deem it necessary to use them, should run in the reading direction. Vertically, in the case of lists, indices, or numerical tables; horizontally otherwise.</li>
	<li>A rule located at the edge of a table (either top/bottom, or left/right side) serves no function.</li>
	<li>Leave enough white space.</li>
	<li>As expected, use <em>tabular figures</em>, and align columns. For figures, flush right alignment or on the decimal is usually best.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/TypographyElementsTable.png" /></p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Error:</strong> Prevent <em>data prisons</em>; don't overemphasize the grid of the table, don't lock data inside a box with thick borders.</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Type Exercise:</strong> Find a poorly designed chart or table from an old text-book, and redesign it.</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>Lists are meant to stand out from the rest of the text, and sum up lots of items in a short and quick manner. For this, using the standard bullet (unordered lists) or numbers (ordered lists) are still the best way to go. Alternatives to the bullet are squares or arrows, as long as you keep them small---they should be big enough to be noticeable, but no bigger.</p>

<p>Lists, by default, are indented from the left in most software. Some people recommend hanging the bullets in the margin instead, but that should only be done if you have other means to make the list stand out from the rest of the body text. Additionally, don't leave too much space between list items, or they will be perceived as separate paragraphs, instead of items from a list. And lastly, avoid over-punctuating your lists; they should be short and sweet.</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyElementsLists.png" /></p>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Images have already (partly) been discussed, but here's a list of the rules again:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoid placing text over images; let text and images stand in their own right.</li>
	<li>If you can't or don't want to do so, make sure the text remains legible, and the image discernible.</li>
	<li>To keep text legible, you can lower the contrast of the image (by placing a coloured, partly transparent box over it), or set off the text by putting it on top such a transparent box.</li>
	<li>To keep the image visible, make it lighter/darker to create more contrast with the text, or use a gradient. This gradient starts at the place where the text block is positioned, but disappears at places where no text is present.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/TypographyElementsImage.png" /></p>

<p>Either way, avoid <em>textured type</em>---putting  an image on top of text---as much as you can.</p>

<h2>Forms</h2>

<p>The idea behind forms is that they ask a user for input, and expect the user to put exactly the right information at the right spit. To accomplish this, people tend to put boxes and vertical lines around everything. Don't. Remove them, and use space to separate elements on the page. Use horizontal lines to accentuate areas of the page; rather <em>above</em> a heading to signal a new section, than underneath it (as is the default for most people).</p>

<p><img src="media/TypographyElementsForm.png" /></p>

<h2>Websites</h2>

<p>It used to be common practice to misuse tables on the web to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. Nowadays, luckily, most people know how bad that is. Not only does it add extra overload and unnecessary problems to a site, it also corrupts the structure; browsers expect what's inside a table to be data, not a complete website. In the same sense, websites made entirely in Flash should be eliminated. Of course, Flash has some advantages such as animation or making a game out of your website, but most of this has been taken over by CSS and JavaScript (and other web libraries). If you do create a Flash website, make sure the text inside it is easily accessible somewhere.</p>

<p>Webpages also require more contrast, and columns of smaller line-width than usual; more than 70 characters becomes tiring. Screens are becoming good enough to use serif fonts for the body copy, but mixing it with sans serif still remains the wise choice.</p>

<p>Colour is free on the web, so use it. Instead of full white or black, however, it's often better to use light or dark greys. Colour is a good way to increase the contrast without meddling with other typographic choices, but should not be your only visual cue.</p>

<p>And last of all, <em>symbol fonts</em> are very effective. By linking information to a symbol, you make a design more interesting, while at the same time conveying lots of information in little space. It also works across different languages and cultures.</p>

  title: "[Typography] Editing & Proofreading"
  post: "<p>The last stage of the design process is checking and rechecking everything; both design decisions as well as the actual textual content. You shouldn't find major problems in this stage (if you do, go back to the start), but instead fix grammatical, spelling and punctuation errors. There's not really a performance difference between accurately reading text in print (<em>hard copy</em>) or on a screen (<em>soft copy</em>), so whatever process you choose is up to you.</p>

<p>Before we begin: the term <em>proofreading</em> comes from the fact that, before final printing begins, multiple test copies called <em>proofs</em> are made. This is, of course, only applicable to when something has a final form; websites, for example, are dynamic and ever-changing, and will probably need constant updating.</p>

<h2>General Advice</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Let other people check your text; they will spot errors and mistakes much easier.</li>
	<li>Don't over-format your text. As you're writing, you shouldn't think about the typography, but only the text itself. This is especially true for authors, as the final design of their books is usually not chosen by themselves, and depends on the length and structure of the final text.</li>
	<li>Don't wait for proofs to examine the text. Read the content, and whenever you spot an error and think you've found an inconsistency, immediately change it or at least keep a list of possible errors at all times.</li>
	<li>As you proofread and edit a text, don't obfuscate the original text, and don't just put down a red cross mark. Let the original text stay visible, and state what exactly is wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Soft Copy</h2>

<p>Editing soft copy is quick, as you can immediately change things within the editor. On the other hand, however, you must scrupulously remove all the edits before final production begins. You're also more limited in your choices for editing; you can't write on the page as you can with hard copy.</p>

<p>Typographic styles (such as <em>italic</em>, <strong>bold</strong> or <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">small caps</span> can be changed directly, just as converting hyphens to dashes, or <em>dumb quotes</em> (straight quotes) to <em>smart quotes</em> (curly quotes). When it comes to changes in the text itself, though, the editor needs to communicate with the author. The following notation is common:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Words to be removed are <s>struck out</s></li>
	<li>Words to be added or substituted are <u>underlined</u>, <span style="background-color:yellow">highlighted</span>, or <span style="color:red">coloured</span>.</li>
	<li>Comments to the author are [set within brackets]</li>
	<li>When it comes to punctuation, strike out the entire word instead of just the punctuation, as underlining punctuation is messy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hard Copy</h2>

<p>The image below shows easy ways to show what's wrong within the text, as well as marks to add in the margin to make clear what exactly should be done.</p>

  title: "[Typography] The Design Process"
  post: "<p>This course has discussed the design process from start to finish; from a blank page and lots of text, to a finished typographic design. We've looked at everything in great detail, which might make you lose sight on the bigger picture. In this chapter I want to lay out a step-by-step plan for designs, to sum up everything that has been discussed. Of course, you're not required to strictly follow the plan and can do steps in a different order or to a different extent whenever you feel like it.</p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Look to the Past:</strong> Look at existing typographic designs and fonts that you like. If you can find out what is so good about a design, or why it is able to stand the test of time, you can transfer those elements to your own design. Don't directly copy other people's work; but be inspired, and always look at the history of typefaces and layouts for ideas.</li>
	<li><strong>Body Text: </strong>Most of your project will be body text. Start with it, and most other elements will fall into place. Body text requires a careful look at the <em>font</em>, <em>point size</em>,<em> measure</em>, and <em>leading</em>.</li>
	<li><strong>Create Hierarchy: </strong>Establish the hierarchy of your design. If you're stuck, it's often wise to start with a general distinction between <em>foreground</em> and <em>background</em>. The foreground contains the most important elements that need attention (such as body text), while the background contains everything else that doesn't require immediate attention (it's not necessarily empty). First try to establish hierarchy with only one typeface and a limited amount of tools, only include more typefaces or visual cues if all else fails. If you do so, at least make sure the <em>x-heights</em> align.</li>
	<li><strong>Use (White) Space: </strong>Let the white space flow through the design. Leave large amounts of blank space to bring more attention to the really important parts. Don't clutter the page, don't make things too large or spread out. Work outward from the (body) text, not inward from the page edges. Use grids, margins and gutters to your advantage.</li>
	<li><strong>Connect the Elements: </strong>Every element within the design should be there for a reason; it needs to have a relationship with the rest. Show this relationship in the way you typeset every element, and don't let anything hang loose. An incoherent design is never good.</li>
	<li><strong>Be Consistent:</strong> Elements with a different meaning should always look different. Elements that are very similar should always look (nearly) the same. Whatever style you choose to apply, be consistent and don't arbitrarily switch between styles. If you've decided on a set of style rules for the body text, transfer the majority of those to other text blocks.</li>
	<li><strong>Keep it Simple: </strong>Don't use more than three fonts, don't use more than five colours in a palette, don't place information on every page that could just as well have been stated only once. Highlighting nearly every word destroys the effect of highlighting, while making everything big, bold and beautiful destroys the effects of contrast and balance. Before you add anything, think about whether it's really necessary.</li>
	<li><strong>Make Small Adjustments:</strong> Placing the bulk of the matter is easy with some knowledge about typography and usage of a grid. The secret to success, however, is in the fine-tuning. Don't make changes in steps that are too large; you might miss the sweet spot. In most cases, the difference between not enough and too much is naught.</li>
	<li><strong>Experiment: </strong>Logical and calculated decisions can kickstart your design and help you when you're stuck. You can never completely predict how something will look, though, and experimenting will add just that little bit extra to any design. Maybe you find an amazing new way to separate paragraphs, maybe you find the perfect but weird solution to a problem you were having. Don't be afraid to try things out; you can always undo it.</li>

  title: "[Typography] Tips & Tricks"
  post: "<p>I tried my best, but some advice just couldn't be placed anywhere without seeming out of place or making things unnecessarily complicated. This chapter will provide you with a list of leftover guidelines, rules and tips.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Garamond is one of the best fonts for usage in print. For web, however, one of the best (neutral) serif alternatives is Georgia.</li>
	<li>Type cannot be disconnected from material nor language. Some languages require different symbols, or the more frequent use of certain letters or diacritics, and you must account for that. On the other hand, for example, if the type is going to be carved into wood, a different font should be used than when it's simply displayed on screen.</li>
	<li>Dark text on a light background needs to be thicker. Light text on a dark background needs to be thinner. Therefore, when a text is back-lit or "glowing", such as is the case with airport signs, the type needs to be thinner to stay legible.</li>
	<li>Avoid confusion about characters. When picking a font, pick one where each character has clear, distinct features. An example is the huge similarity between the lowercase letter L and I.</li>
	<li>Since the invention of printing (15<sup>th</sup> century), the alphabet (and some typographic practices) haven't changed much. It's therefore reasonable to expect it won't change much in the future; so look to the past for inspiration.</li>
	<li>We read best what we read most. People have been told that roman fonts are the most legible, but if every book would have been set in proper italics, that would be fine as well. This is even true with badly designed typography. Therefore, sometimes, it's best to break the rules to account for user behaviour or expectations.</li>
	<li>When testing a font, the word <em>Handgloves</em> contains enough information about a font and its letterforms for you to decide if you want to use it.</li>
	<li>Some words just naturally sound better or look nicer than others, and some are just scarier or more boring. Keep in mind the meaning and natural form of words; facts or numbers may need some extra emphasis to come across, while already strong words may need less emphasis to keep the balance.</li>
	<li>Dark emotions call for a black typeface with sharp edges; pleasant feelings are best evoked by informal, light characters. Or not. Context matters a lot.</li>
	<li>For printed text, 9 to 12 point body text is optimal. Smaller sizes are acceptable for captions and notes. Larger type should be reserved for low-resolution displays or more senior audiences.</li>
	<li>Dark text on a light background, or vice versa, still works best. Coloured text on coloured backgrounds must be executed with caution. Performance is optimal when the contrast levels exceed 70 percent, which is another reason to avoid heavily textured backgrounds.</li>
	<li>Whatever typographic genius you come up with, don't let it turn into a gimmick. When one master design is used to fit all sizes and content, subtleties are lost. "Jack of all trades, master of none."</li>
	<li>Be aware of the situation people will read your design in. A how-to manual or cookbook are read in situations that are often less than ideal. Text along the highway will have to be read from great distance and with great speed (without compromising driver safety, of course).</li>
	<li>When going for an advertisement, or something like it, use no more than eight elements, and arrange it in a predictable layout. You don't want your ad to be ignored, or read without people realizing it's an ad.</li>
	<li>Make the bulk of the matter fit, and only then go back to the exceptions or extremes and work them out one by one. If you don't work this way, your design will only handle a few exceptions well, but fail overall.</li>
	<li>Sometimes, however, design needs to fail. By doing something odd or unusual, you direct attention towards the text which might otherwise be missed.</li>
	<li>When looking for inspiration, lots of typographers use their own handwriting.</li>
	<li>There is no such thing as bad type. There's only type suited for particular purposes, and perhaps not for others.</li>
	<li>In a single surface packed with well-organized information is often better than multiple pages with gigantic amounts of white space. Typography is just as urban life; density invites intimate exchange among people and ideas.</li>
	<li>Combining a very traditional layout with a not-so-traditional (though not too silly) typeface often has a wonderfully surprising effect.</li>
	<li>Sans serif x-heights tend to be larger in relationships to their cap heights than serifs. This means sans serif typefaces can often be read at very small sizes, as opposed to serif typefaces.</li>
	<li>Read the text before designing it, and use typography to honour this content. In general, typography needs to do the following things: invite the reader into the text, reveal the meaning and message, clarify the structure and order, link it with the other design elements, and create an energetic response.</li>
	<li>Check the license of fonts. Some fonts may not be used on the web, some may only be used in non-commercial projects, some may only be used by a restricted amount of users, and so on. Not all fonts you find for free are actually free.</li>
	<li>Typography should be very <em>ordinary</em>, so that attention is drawn to the quality of the composition. No aspect should stand out; leading, measure, letterforms, space, everything should harmoniously work together.</li>
	<li>Be aware of typographic expectations. Fresh produce always seems to want a handwritten sort of message, while high-tech applications seem to demand a cool, technocratic look. Warm and cuddly products work well with a soft serif, while grainy whole foods are often represented by a handmade, rough typeface, and serious business want to relive the era of copperplate engraving.</li>
	<li>Good typography has a rhythm, just like music.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Digital Typography</h2>

<img src="media/TypographyDigitalHinting.png" />

<p>I want to remind you here that the typographic principles I've discussed, and that have governed print for the last decennia, work across all types of media---even screen. The only thing to be aware of, is that screens consist of pixels, which means the letters you see are actually tiny square blocks put together to give you the illusion of smooth curves. Certain algorithms, such as <em>hinting</em> and <em>anti-aliasing</em>, are often automatically performed on text displayed on screen. You actually don't have much control over this---in some rare cases you can choose to turn them off, but it's best to leave them on, as they make the curves of fonts appear smooth. Be aware, though, that for this reason type on screen may differ from the final print or different screen resolutions. Design for both low- and high end technology, and follow the work to the printer.</p>

  title: "The Guide to SASS"
  post: "<p>With CSS you can already do amazing things, but some crucial features are missing. Have you ever typed the same values for something ten times in a row, and wished you could have just saved it once in a variable? Have you ever wished you could take an existing value and dynamically add 10 pixels to it? Well, all of that (and more) can be done with <strong>SASS</strong>.</p>

<p>SASS stands for <em>Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets</em>, and it's a so-called<em> CSS pre-processor</em>. This simply means that you can write something in SASS-syntax, and then <em>compile </em>or output the file to regular CSS. This way, you can use very powerful variables and extra functions that SASS provides while you're editing the stylesheet---simplifying your life. Additionally, you can choose how to compile the stylesheet to save space and bandwidth.</p>

<p><img src="media/SASSWorkflowOverview.png" /></p>

<p>So, unless you're a beginner and don't know anything about CSS yet, there's no reason <em>not</em> to learn SASS! It will make your life easier. And more fun. I promise. I really do.</p>

  title: "[SASS] Installation"
  post: "<p>To be able to use SASS, unlike CSS, we need to install it on the computer. Don't worry; the package is very small and easy to install. The installation, however, works via something called <em>gems</em>, which is a cool feature of the <em>Ruby</em> language. So, what do we do? We install Ruby, then we install SASS.</p>

<h2>Installing Ruby</h2>

<p>How the Ruby installation works depends on your operating system.</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>Linux installs Ruby (and lots of other things) through package management systems. The Ruby website has an excellent page explaining how to do so for every Linux system; <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#package-management-systems">Ruby Installation</a></p>

<h3>Mac</h3>

<p>Yay, Ruby is installed on Macintosh computers by default! You can skip to the next step.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>For Windows, you need to download the <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org">Ruby Installer</a>, and then simply run it and perform a few clicks.</p>

<p>Make sure the option <em>Add Ruby executables to your PATH</em> is checked.</p>

<h3>Check if it Worked</h3>

<p>To really make sure installation was successful, open the command line tool on your system. This is (probably) <em>Command Prompt</em> for Windows, <em>Terminal</em> for Mac, and <em>Bash</em> for Linux. Then type</p>

<pre data-lang="ruby">ruby---v</pre>

<p>And it should return your current Ruby version.</p>

<h2>Installing Sass</h2>

<p>Now, with Ruby installed, getting SASS is quick and the same line across all systems. Again, in your command line tool, type</p>

<pre data-lang="ruby">gem install sass</pre>

<p>It should show you the steps it's taking (downloading, installing, parsing, &hellip;) and say something like "<em>1 gem installed</em>" when finished. If it fails, you will need to use</p>

<pre data-lang="ruby">sudo gem install sass</pre>

<p>All this does is access the command line as an administrator of your system, which gives you more rights for installing and modifying the system. That's it! You can check if installation was successful by typing</p>

<pre data-lang="ruby">sass -v</pre>

<p>Again, it should return he the current version of SASS.</p>

  title: "[SASS] Compiling"
  post: "<p>Just as CSS, you can write SASS code in any regular text editor. (You can also write it in fancy expensive text editors, don't worry.) What's really important to understand, are two things:  the <em>file formats</em> and <em>how to compile</em>.</p>

<h2>File Formats</h2>

<p>In the early days of SASS, files---not surprisingly---carried the extension <code>.sass</code>. While cool, it had to change when the language changed a lot and became bigger and better.</p>

<p>Nowadays, files that contain SASS code carry the extension <code>.scss</code></p>

<p>So, all you need to do is create a text file, and change the extension. You can do this in the default text editor of your system, or you can use a text editor made specifically for CSS and all its brothers and sisters. (There are more pre-processing languages, but they are smaller and more specific than SASS.)</p>

<h2>Compiling</h2>

<p>Compilation can be done through the command line tool, or by using software.</p>

<h3>Command Line</h3>

<p>If you only want to compile a file once, use:</p>

<pre data-lang="ruby">sass inputfile.scss outputfile.css</pre>

<p>But, as it so often happens, you're probably making continuous small changes to the stylesheet and want some files to compile automatically. For that, we can <em>watch</em> a file or folder for changes, and if a file is saved with changes, our computer will automatically compile it.</p>

<p>To watch a single file, use</p>

<pre data-lang="ruby">sass --watch inputfile.scss:outputfile.css</pre>

<p>To watch all the files within a folder, use</p>

<pre data-lang="ruby">sass --watch inputfolder:outputfolder</pre>

<p>NOTE: You need to keep the command line tool open to keep watching. It will probably tell you that.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the command line tool, this might be hard to understand. In the code above, I assume you've navigated your command line tool to the directory that contains your SASS files or folders.</p>

<p>If you haven't, or don't know how to do that, you can use <em>absolute paths</em>, such as</p>

<pre data-lang="ruby">C:\\Users\\yourusername\\somefolder\\somesassfile.scss</pre>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>I personally like the free and open source <a href="http://koala-app.com">Koala</a>, but the paid <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> and <a href="http://compass.handlino.com">Compass.app</a> are also popular and contain more features. Compiling with software usually amounts to selecting the file, and clicking <em>compile</em> somewhere.</p>

<h2>Compilation Options</h2>

<p>There are four styles to use for compilation: <em>expanded</em>, <em>nested</em>,<em> compact</em>, and <em>compressed</em>. The second one is selected by default. To override the current compilation settings on a file, use</p>

<pre data-lang="ruby">
sass --update somefile.scss --style expanded
sass --update somefile.scss --style nested
sass --update somefile.scss --style compact
sass --update somefile.scss --style compressed</pre>

<p>These compilation styles go from large to small. The expanded style gives all properties and selectors their own lines and indents them properly, while the compressed style places everything immediately behind each other. The first one's easier to read, understand and work with, while the last one's small and fastest to load.</p>

<img src="media/SASSCompilationOptions.png" />

<p>So, I suggest you use one of the first two when developing, testing, and checking if everything works as expected. I suggest you use one of the last two when deploying to an actual live website.</p>

  title: "[SASS] Variables"
  post: "<p>Perhaps the greatest advantage of using SASS, is being able to use <em>variables</em>. Instead of copying or retyping similar or exactly the same bits of code, we can save it inside a variable name once, and use that. To declare a variable, use the following dollar syntax:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$some-variable-name: <em>value</em>;</code>

<p>A variable can be one of six different types:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>String</strong>: Any piece of text. Usually enclosed within quotes, but not necessary.</li>
	<li><strong>Number</strong>: Any number (with and without unit).</li>
	<li><strong>Colour</strong>: Any colour.</li>
	<li><strong>Boolean</strong>: Either <em>true</em> or <em>false.</em></li>
	<li><strong>List</strong>: A list of properties of varying types. This can be a spaced list, or one with commas.</li>
	<li><strong>Maps</strong>: A mapping of values to other values.</li>
	<li><strong>Null</strong></li>
</ul>

<pre data-lang="scss">
$a-cool-string: "Juan is a cool guy";
$a-number: 350;
$some-colour: #FFAA22;
$boolean: true;
$a-fancy-list: 5px solid grey;
$an-intricate-map: (text: green, header: red, remark: grey);
$null-variable: null;
</pre>

<p>NOTE: As you can see, maps are created with a syntax that is quite peculiar for CSS. The general form is <code>(key1: value1, key2: value2, &hellip;)</code>. Nevertheless, maps can be extremely useful sometimes.</p>

<p>When you use a variable, it just inserts the literal value of that variable into the CSS code. This makes it very easy and intuitive to use, and allows for great flexibility. I suggest you put anything that is likely to be used more than once inside a variable.</p>

<p>I also suggest giving the variables descriptive names, and working with scales. For example, <code>$font-stack-body</code> and <code>$font-stack-headers</code>, is better than <code>$font-stack-one</code> and <code>$font-stack-two</code></p>

<p>The naming convention is to place dashes between words, just as regular CSS does with its properties. This is, however, not necessary if you prefer your own methods.</p>

<h2>Variables in Selectors</h2>

<p>Variables are typically used to insert a value somewhere, but we can also use them in selectors or property names. To do so, we need to wrap the variable name inside the <em>interpolation syntax</em>. Sounds difficult, but it simply looks like</p>

<code class="longsyntax">#{$some-variable-name}</code>

<pre data-lang="scss">
p.#{someclassname} {
	font-size: $paragraph-size;
	color: $paragraph-colour;
}

  title: "[SASS] Mixins"
  post: "<p>We've seen how to store values and lists of values, but what if we want to store a bunch of declarations? That's when we use <em>mixins</em>.</p>

<p>To create a mixin, we need to make up a name and determine the variables it will use. Then, we use the following syntax</p>

<code class="longsyntax">@mixin some-function-name(variable<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, variable<sub>n</sub>) {
	<em>declarations</em>
}</code>

<p>Now we've created our mixin, but how do we use it? For this, we need to <em>include</em> it somewhere with the following syntax</p>

<code class="longsyntax">@include some-function-name(value<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, value<sub>n</sub>);</code>

<pre data-lang="scss">
@mixin set-border-radius($radius) {
	border-top-left-radius:$radius;
	border-top-right-radius:$radius;
	border-bottom-left-radius:$radius;
}

//Now paragraphs have border radius of 10px on all corners, except bottom right
p {
	@include set-border-radius(10px);
}
</pre>

<p>As you can see, not only can you easily copy the same set of declarations around, you can also change the parameters every time you include it. If you know you're going to use the same parameters every time, you can of course ditch the variables and just use fixed values within the mixin.</p>

<p>Mixins are especially useful when working with vendor-prefixes. Instead of retyping the same property for all browsers, just put it inside a mixin.</p>

  title: "[SASS] Operators"
  post: "<p>Now that we know how to save values and declarations, wouldn't it be nice if we could make those values dynamic? For example, instead of setting something to a fixed number, we could let SASS calculate the number (based on other variables) when it compiles.</p>

<p>To do so, we can use the standard math operators: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code></p>

<p>We can use numerical variables, as well as regular numbers, to perform those mathematical operations.  What's also important to notice, is that SASS can convert between several different units. If you use a number without unit, it will automatically take on the value of the other units. If you multiply the value by percentages, it will turn into a percentage.</p>

<p>Additionally, we can concatenate strings with the plus symbol, and add colours together. Adding colours goes piecewise; it adds the Red, Green, and Blue channel separately.</p>

<pre data-lang="scss">
h2 {
	font-size:$font-size-h1 / 1.618px;
	color: #FFAA22 + #0055DD; //#FFFFFF
}

#main {
	width: 800px / 1200px * 100%; //66.667%
}

#sidebar {
	width: 400px / 1200px * 100%; //33.333%
}
</pre>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Besides the default multiline CSS comments (created with <code>/* */</code>), SASS also supports single line comments. These are created with the standard double slash, <code>//</code>, and are removed from the file when compiled.</p>

<pre data-lang="scss">
/* I AM 
   A
   MULTILINE
   COMMENT 
*/

// I'm a single line comment
</pre>

<h2>Shorthand Properties</h2>

<p>Within CSS, some shorthand properties exist that already use the slash. When SASS encounters two fixed values with a slash between them (and no space), it will assume you want to use the shorthand property and doesn't apply division. In all other cases, such as with variables, SASS performs division.</p>

<p>So, if you want to divide fixed values, leave spaces around the slash. But, if you want to use the shorthand property with variables, use the interpolation syntax.</p>

<pre data-lang="scss">
font-size: 12px/18px; //Interpreted by regular CSS as 12px font size, 18px line height
font-size: 12px / 18px; //Calculated by SASS
font-size: $some-var/$another-var; //Calculated by SASS
font-size: #{$some-var}/#{$another-var}; //Shorthand again
</pre>

<h2>Parentheses</h2>

<p>Lastly, you can force SASS to perform division, and to group numbers together, by placing parentheses around it. Additionally, this can be used to make sure a negation operator is associated with the corresponding number.</p>

<pre data-lang="scss">
font-size: 20px - (5px + 5px); //10px
font-size: 20px (-5px) + 5px; //Error
font-size: 20px - 5px + 5px; //20px

  title: "[SASS] Nesting"
  post: "<p>One of the reasons HTML is so simple and easy to use, is its clear nesting structure---which CSS unfortunately lacks. Again, SASS comes to the rescue!</p>

<p>We can nest selectors inside other selectors, simply by placing them within each other. This way we can create styles for different elements within the same parent element, without having to retype the path to the parent every time.</p>

<code class="longsyntax">selector {
	otherselector {
		<em>styles</em>
	}

	anotherselector {
		<em>styles</em>
	}

	<em>general styles</em>
}</code>

<pre data-lang="scss">
#nav {
	a {
		background-color: lightblue;
	}

	background-color: blue;
}

/*** OUTPUTS TO ***/
#nav {
	background-color: blue;
}

#nav a {
	background-color: lightblue;
}
</pre>

<p>Be aware, though, that overly nested rules create overqualified CSS, unnecessarily increasing file size and complexity. If you don't necessarily need to specify something in a selector, by all means, leave it out. Keep things simple, keep things short.</p>

<h2>Parents</h2>

<p>Sometimes when you're nested, you want to access your parent. For example, if you want to add pseudo-elements or pseudo-classes. This is done with the <code>&amp;</code> symbol.</p>

<pre data-lang="scss">
#nav {
	//Executed when user hovers over #nav element
	&:hover {
		background-color: lightblue;
	}
}
</pre>

<h2>Media Queries</h2>

<p>Media queries work exactly like in regular CSS, but with SASS you can also nest them inside other selectors. This way, you can put media queries close to the element they belong to, and make them more specific.</p>

<pre data-lang="scss">
#nav {
	width:600px;
	margin:auto;

	//Special styles for #nav for certain maximum screen size
	@media screen and (max-width:600px) {
		width:100%;
		margin:0;
	}
}

  title: "[SASS] Import & Extend"
  post: "<p>With mixins, we've seen how to save a set of declarations in a function with parameters. However, if you don't require parameters, there's an easier way. You can copy <em>all</em> the declarations from inside another selector to somewhere else by using</p>

<code class="longsyntax">@extend selector;</code>

<pre data-lang="scss">
.specialParagraphs {
	color:brown;
	font-size:10px;
}

.specialLinks {
	@extend .specialParagraphs;

	text-decoration:none;
	border-bottom:2px solid brown;
}

/*** OUTPUTS TO ***/
.specialParagraphs {
	color:brown;
	font-size:10px;
}

.specialLinks {
	color:brown;
	font-size:10px;
	text-decoration:none;
	border-bottom:2px solid brown;
}
</pre>

<p>Note, though that this selector needs to be <em>single element</em> (perhaps with pseudo-class or pseudo-element added to it). More complex selectors won't work.</p>

<p>Additionally, SASS provides an extra type of selector called the <em>placeholder selector</em>. It looks like a regular <em>class</em> or <em>id</em> selector, except that the <code>#</code> or <code>.</code> is replaced by a <code>%</code>. These placeholder selectors will be ignored and not rendered, <em>unless</em> they are extended somewhere. This allows you to create styles that you know will only be extended in some stylesheets, and never used directly in your HTML---which saves space and avoids naming collisions.</p>

<pre data-lang="scss">
%specialParagraphs {
	color:brown;
	font-size:10px;
}

.specialLinks {
	@extend %specialParagraphs;

	text-decoration:none;
	border-bottom:2px solid brown;
}

/*** OUTPUTS TO ***/
.specialLinks {
	color:brown;
	font-size:10px;
	text-decoration:none;
	border-bottom:2px solid brown;
}
</pre>

<h2>Importing</h2>

<p>And lastly, we can modularize our CSS even more by splitting it into multiple files. SASS allows us to place snippets of code inside separate files, and then import those into multiple other big files.</p>

<p>Such a snippet is called a <em>partial</em>, and requires the filename to start with an underscore (e.g., <code>_partial.scss</code>).</p>

<p>To import the snippet, we use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">@import 'partial';</code>

<p>The underscore and extension can be left behind; SASS knows what you mean and will figure it out.</p>

<p>CSS already has a native import option, but it has one large drawback; CSS creates another HTTP request for every import. Therefore, it increases server load and page load time. SASS, on the other hand, can put everything in a single file as it compiles. Yay!</p>

<p>NOTE: The special file naming and importing syntax in SASS is, therefore, used to bypass the native importing function.</p>

  title: "[SASS] Functions"
  post: "<p>When we created mixins, we already learnt how to create our own <em>functions</em>. By simply choosing a name and filling in the variables, we could insert lots of rules in lots of places. Fortunately, our life can become even easier---we don't even need to create some of the mixins, as SASS has a huge amount of <em>built-in functions</em>!</p>

<p>There are way too much of them to cover here, and you probably won't ever need most of them, but some of them are too useful to pass up. You can find a list of all functions in the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html">SASS Documentation</a></p>

<p>As usual, functions are executed with the following syntax:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">some-function-name(value<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, value<sub>n</sub>)</code>

<p>Alternatively, if you don't like to remember the order of the parameters, you can pass the values by keyword:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">some-function-name(param: val, &hellip;, param: val)</code>

<p>Here's an example using some of the colour functions, useful for dynamic colour palettes.</p>

<pre data-lang="scss">
$main-colour: #995511;

body {
	background: darken($main-colour, 80%);
}

h1, h2 {
	color: lighten($main-colour, 40%);
}

p {
	color: $main-colour;
}

.logo {
	background: saturate($main-colour, 20%)
}

.metadata {
	color: desaturate($main-colour, 40%);
}
</pre>

<h2>Returning</h2>

<p>Like any proper programming language, you can also create your own functions that don't create any rules, but instead return a value (after some complicated calculations). To do so, use the following syntax:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">@function some-function-name(variable<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, variable<sub>n</sub>) {
	<em>stuff</em>

	@return <em>value</em>;
}
</code>

<p>As expected, you can use multiple return statements to return different values based on certain conditions. And, once such a statement is executed, the compiler immediately stops going through the function and continues compiling the rest of the stylesheet.</p>

<pre data-lang="scss">
@function mix-text-colour($colour-one, $colour-two) {
  $new-colour: $colour-one + $colour-two;
  @return $new-colour;
}

p {
	color: mix-text-colour(green, blue);
}

  title: "[SASS] Control Flow"
  post: "<p>This chapter's title is just a fancy name for controlling how the stylesheet is compiled. More specifically, it's about controlling which parts are ultimately going to be rendered, and how often. The program determines this based on certain conditions and expressions you provide. If you've done any sort of programming work, you should be familiar with these.</p>

<p>I'll give you a quick overview about <em>if-else</em> and <em>loops</em>. If you want to know more, I suggest you check out the <em>JavaScript </em>course. It uses the same principles, and if you're learning advanced CSS stuff, you'll probably also like (and need) JavaScript.</p>

<h2>If-Else</h2>

<p>To create a simple <strong>if-else</strong> statement, that adds one value if the condition is true, and another if it's false or null, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">if(condition, <em>value if true</em>, <em>value if false</em>)</code>

<pre data-lang="scss">
p {
  color: if(lightness($background-color) > 50, #000, #fff); //Set text colour dark/light based on background colour
}
</pre>

<p>To create more complex statements that add a certain set of styles based on multiple conditions, we use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">
@if condition {
	<em>styles</em>
} @else if condition {
	<em>styles</em>
} @else {
	<em>styles</em>
}
</code>

<p>Of course you can use as many <code>@else if</code> statements as you like, which means you can also omit them entirely.</p>

<pre data-lang="scss">
p {
  @if (lightness($background-color) > 50) {
    color: #000000; // Light background, make text colour dark
  } @else {
    color: #ffffff; // Dark background, make text colour light
  }
}
</pre>

<h2>Loops</h2>

<p>To repeat a set of styles, without having to retype it yourself, we can use a loop. To create a <strong>for loop</strong>, use one of these two syntaxes:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">@for $var from <em><start></em> through <em><end></em>
@for $var from <em><start></em> to <em><end></em></code>

<p>Note that the first syntax <em>includes</em> the <code><end></code> value, while the second syntax doesn't.</p>

<pre data-lang="scss">
//Set first nine children to gradually darker background colours
p {
	@for $i from 1 to 10 {
		&:nth-child($i) {
			background-color: darken($main-colour, ($i*5)%);
		}
	}
}
</pre>

<p>To create a <strong>for each loop</strong> through a list or map, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">@each $var in <em><list or map></em></code>

<pre data-lang="scss">
$map = (cat1: "Panda", cat2: "Jaguar", cat3: "Koala", cat4: "Bushdog");

//Sets elements with classes cat1, cat2, cat3, cat4 to their respective animal
@each $cat, $name in $map {
	.#{$cat}::after {
		content: $name;
	}
}
</pre>

<p>To create a <strong>while loop</strong>, which keeps looping as long as a condition is true, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">@while condition</code>

<p>Note that this is rarely necessary, and also make sure you don't create infinite loops. Check if there's always a way for the condition to return false and exit the loop.</p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p>Last, but certainly not least, it can be very useful to debug your SASS code in case there's an error. If something doesn't go as planned, but you don't know why, it's helpful to debug. This means letting the compiler spit out the values of certain variables or functions or whatever, while it's compiling. This way you can check if everything actually is going like it should be.</p>

<p>To print out a value to the standard error stream---which is the command line tool if you use that, or part of the software if you use that---we use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">@debug <em>expression</em></code>

<pre data-lang="scss">
$some-variable: 20px;
$some-other-variable: 30px;
@debug $some-variable + $some-other-variable; //Should print 50px

  title: "Fundamental Design Principles"
  post: "<p>Design has always been a large part of our lives. Whatever product you make, you want it to be as beautiful and simple to use as possible. Even stories need a form of visual design---good typography---when they are to be successfully published as books. Because design is always present in any and every project, I think everybody should know and understand the basic principles underpinning what makes a good design.</p>

<h2>The Two Fields</h2>

<p>There is, however, an important distinction to be made between two fields of design: <strong>graphic design</strong> and <strong>usability</strong>. The first field looks at how a product looks and feels, be it a photograph or webpage or an actual real-world object. The second looks at how a product works, sells and interacts with its users. These two fields are closely related, and creating well-designed products will always be a combination of applying principles from both fields. To make a design usable, everything has to be laid out in a clear and simple manner. To make a design look good, every part and process needs to be at the right place and executed in the right way. Furthermore, for a product to be embraced by society, it needs to sell and be fun and memorable. The two fields influence each other all the time.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignVersusUsability.png" /></p>

<p>This course will only look at the first one: <em>graphic design</em>. We will look at what techniques you should use to structure your information and convey a message, as well as the actual methods you should use to create the visual shapes belonging to these techniques. In other words: the course starts with a description of the basic building blocks of visual design, and then continues with explaining how they relate to each other to create good design.</p>

<p>Because visual design is such as huge topic, though, some parts (<strong><em>colour theory</em></strong> and <strong><em>typography</em></strong>) have received their own separate course. I highly recommend reading those as well, as they raise your design skills to a more advanced level. You can read them at any time you want, and I won't include them in this course's table of contents, but I suggest you read them very early in your design learning process.</p>

<h2>The Two Main Purposes</h2>

<p>Throughout the course, you'll notice that there nearly every design wants to meet one of two main purposes, which are</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> You want a design to convey a sense of beauty. It needs to leave a positive impression, make somebody feel positive emotions, make people happier and impressed by looking at the design.</li>
	<li><strong>Functionality: </strong>You want a design to convey information of any kind. People need to be able to understand things from a quick glance at your design, and they need to learn about your product, company, mission, or story by looking at the design.</li>
</ul>

<p>The best designs of course want to mix these two purposes, but you'll notice that they are not easily combined. Some elements of a design increase beauty but decrease usability, while other elements are very practical and efficient but don't look so good. Keep this distinction in mind, and decide which of the purposes is most important for your design before you begin.</p>

<p>Good luck becoming a designer!</p>

  title: "[Design] What is Graphic Design?"
  post: "<p>Every design has the same starting point. No matter what you're doing, you need to have a <em>purpose</em> for your design. Whether you're designing assets for a game, or designing a software's interface, or creating expressive paintings---you'll always have a purpose your design should fulfil.</p>

<p>Most of the time, this purpose will be a message you want to send. Even when you're just drawing a fantasy character for a game, you want that particular design to send a certain message. For example, the hero of the game should send messages related to that; strong, heroic, the perfect leader, muscular, and so on. As opposed to a minor background character, which should recede in the composition and make itself look small.</p>

<p>Similarly, as I'm writing this course, I am thinking about the best way to present the information I want you to understand---should I use images? What sections and subsections should I use? What colours should I use on the website for this course? How long should I make chapters?</p>

<p>Visual design is all about collecting your content and finding the message you want to send, and then using visuals to send that message using this content you have.</p>

<p>I do want to stress once more that fifty percent of visual design, is a direct result of usability design. Usually, if you focus on making your product as simple, effective and efficient as possible, its visuals will automatically present themselves to you and take shape. Only part of the purpose of visual design is enriching and "beautifying" designs, the other part is the important structuring and messaging of information.</p>

<p>Before we continue, let me just remind you that this course isn't about <strong><em>drawing</em></strong> (which has its own course), mostly because you'd be missing the point of visual design. Drawing is about learning to represent cubes, spheres, trees, elephants, whatever by drawing lines with your pencil. Design is about putting abstract ideas or information into a visually engaging format.</p>

<h2>The 3 Basic Components</h2>

<p>Visual design consists of three basic components:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Visual Elements:</strong> The actual visual marks made on the page. Examples are dots, lines, and squares.</li>
	<li><strong>Visual Properties:</strong> The properties of those visual marks, which we can alter to change their meaning and effect. Examples are colour, texture, and proportions.</li>
	<li><strong>Visual Principles:</strong> Principles, rules and guidelines about how best to combine the other two components. Examples are alignment, proximity, and balance.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignThreeComponents.png" /></p>

<p>This course follows the order in which I presented these components, as every new component builds on the previous one(s). By splitting the whole field into such basic units, I hope to make it easily accessible to anyone, and to keep it as broad and general as possible. After this course, you can pick your software or materials, and perhaps specialize in some aspects of design, and you should be able to do so quickly because you've learnt these fundamentals of design.</p>

<p>NOTE: Of course, on this website I can only show you two-dimensional (computer) designs and not let you touch and look around actual three-dimensional objects, but all the same principles and guidelines still apply to those!</p>

<h2>Tools &amp; Software</h2>

<p>This course tries to be as general as possible, which means you can use your own tools and/or software to apply the principles. The most popular products, however, are from the family of Adobe products:</p>

  title: "[Design] Point"
  post: "<p>The smallest possible visual element you can put in a design, is a <em>point</em>. In the mathematical or abstract sense, a point indicates a precise location, but can't be seen or felt. It's a pair of (x,y) coordinates without area or mass. It's also the smallest unit of measurement---one point is equal to 1/72 of an inch, and we use it to describe font size and the thickness of paper stock.</p>

<p>Graphically, however, it must take on some sort of shape. Even though a point is the smallest <em>possible</em> element, it doesn't necessarily have to be tiniest thing in a design. Usually, points take form as dots or small circles, but any element within a design that stands alone with a recognizable centre is also a point. For example, in a field of text every letter may be considered a point, or the centre of a closed square may be considered a point.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignPoint.png" /></p>

<p>Because of these characteristics, points---when standing on their own---are the best way to indicate single data points or individual and independent information.</p>

<p>The real power of points, however, appears when you use a large group of points to create something bigger. A series of points creates a line. A mass of points can create shape, form, texture, tone, and pattern.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignMultiplyingPoints.png" /></p>

<p>Points don't have a direction; they simultaneously radiate inward and outward. Points are therefore, by themselves, perceived as static and balanced. If you want your design to be calm, relaxed and harmonious, points are the way to go. If you want a more interesting or exciting design, opt for other elements.</p>

<p>A good example of this stasis is the fact that in typography, the point is a period---the definitive end of a line. The point stops movement.</p>

  title: "[Design] Line"
  post: "<p>In a mathematical sense, a line is an infinite series of points next to each other. In the case of design, however, many more variations count as lines. A line can be the path between a start and end point. A line can curve, change thickness, and even have gaps.</p>

<p>Geometrically, this means that lines have length, but no breadth. A line is the path created by a moving point.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignLinesOverview.png" /></p>

<h2>Individual Lines</h2>

<p>Lines, on their own, can fulfil many functions. The most important are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Connect</strong>: When a line is smooth and easy, the eye follows it subconsciously. We can group multiple elements together by drawing smooth and natural lines between them.</li>
	<li><strong>Separate</strong>: On the other hand, when a line is rough and irregular, it impedes movement. By adding rough lines (or line that go against the general direction) between multiple elements we can show there is no connection. This way, lines create boundaries and edges between multiple shapes.</li>
	<li><strong>Direct</strong>: Because lines are automatically followed by viewers, they are the easiest way to direct attention to something or establish an order in which a design should be observed.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignLinesFunctionality.png" /></p>

<p>Additionally, each line brings a certain amount of energy and emotion with it, whether you want it or not. The feeling lines convey is mostly dependant on <em>direction</em>, <em>thickness</em> and <em>path</em>.</p>

<h2>Direction</h2>

<p><strong>Horizontal Lines</strong> are stable, calm, and serene. They rest on the paper, balanced.</p>

<p><strong>Vertical Lines</strong> are more exciting, active, and powerful. They are defying the earth's gravity, and imply energy or reaching towards heights or heavens.</p>

<p><strong>Diagonal Lines</strong> are even more dynamic, and imply motion or tension. Because of this, they also give a feeling of depth.</p>

<p>As you can see, as opposed to static points, lines are inherently dynamic gestures.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignLinesDirection.png" /></p>

<h2>Thickness</h2>

<p><strong>Thin Lines</strong> are soft and restrained. They are subtle and seem to recede in the distance.</p>

<p><strong>Bold Lines</strong> communicate strength and power. They grab attention and seem to come forward in space.</p>

<p>Lines with <strong>varying thickness</strong> (such as drawn with a brush) convey more fluid and undisciplined messages, as opposed to perfect or mechanical lines that convey precision and disciplined messages.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignLinesThickness.png" /></p>

<h2>Path</h2>

<p><strong>Straight Lines</strong> are mechanical, formal and cold. They are simple, effective and efficient, but have more negative or unnatural feelings associated with them.</p>

<p><strong>Curvilinear Lines</strong> are natural, approachable and comforting. They are harder to incorporate without creating total chaos, but you get more warmth and likeability in return.</p>

<p>Path is the most important factor in determining the quality and character of a line.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignLinesPath.png" /></p>

<h2>Combining Lines</h2>

<p>On top of their own functions and properties, lines are the fundamental element of visual geometry. Without it, the triangle, square and circle wouldn't exist. When lines multiply, they can describe planes, shapes, volumes, and textures.</p>

<p>Because of this quality, lines also serve as the edges of objects, as the contours of elements, and can leave positive marks or negative gaps.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignMultiplyingLines.png" /></p>

<h2>Implying Lines</h2>

<p>Lines are perhaps at their strongest when they're invisible. By aligning and shaping elements in a certain way, we <em>imply</em> a line, which not only creates unity and cohesion, but also engages the viewer with the design and makes them more interested. Because things line up, it's easier to find relationships between elements and understand the groups of information. On the other hand, the viewer has to explore and find these implied lines himself, making the design come to life. For example, in typography, characters group into lines of text, and columns align into text blocks. You can clearly see the lines, even though they aren't explicitly drawn.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignLinesImplied.png" /></p>

<p>This is a very important topic, and will be elaborated on further in later chapters.</p>

  title: "[Design] Shape"
  post: "<p>When we give a straight line not only length, but also breadth, we get the simplest of all shapes: a rectangle. But that's a bit boring, so it might be wise to extend our definition of shape to: <em>a shape is any area enclosed by lines</em>. A square is the result of four lines closing off an area, while circles are the result of one large, sweeping curve closing itself. Again, these lines don't necessarily need to be drawn, but can also be implied.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignShapesDefinition.png" /></p>

<p>Whereas a point had zero dimensions, and a line had one (length), shapes have two: <em>width</em> and <em>height</em>. Similarly, whereas the line had one important property we could change to alter its character (line quality), we now have two properties to change: <em>line</em> and <em>fill</em>. Other words for line are <em>stroke</em>, <em>outline</em> or <em>border</em>.</p>

<p>For example, shapes can be transparent but have a solid border, or they can be filled with texture but have no visible outline. This means that shapes can be much more complex and attention-grabbing than lines or points, but it also means they have similar characteristics; flat and horizontal shapes are stable, while vertical and diagonal shapes are more active. Triangles point towards something and imply motion, while circles are static and peaceful.</p>

<p>In general, a line and fill that don't go together well will never result in good design.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignShapesFillStroke.png" /></p>

<p>While our definition of shape is already quite broad, you should try to understand it in an even broader sense. In typography, for example, a field of text is also a plane (built from points and lines). Even though letters are very complex lines, and enclose complex shapes themselves, they---combined together---form a single texture that fills a shape.</p>

<h2>Basic Shapes</h2>

<p>All the shapes you'll ever create, will be created out of certain basic shapes, which are the <strong>triangle</strong>, <strong>square</strong> and <strong>circle</strong>. No matter how complex, any shape can be derived from those in some way or another. I'll therefore only look in depth at the properties of the basic shapes, which you can then easily transfer to any composition. Another advantage that comes from looking at shapes this way, is that you learn to simplify complex shapes, and simpler is always better in the world of design.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignShapesBasic.png" /></p>

<h2>Three Types of Shapes</h2>

<p>In general, a shape is either <em>geometrical</em>, <em>organic </em>or <em>random</em>. To which group they belong determines their inherent message and feeling. A soft, curvilinear shape may appear warm and welcoming, whereas a sharp, angular shape may appear cold and threatening.</p>

<h3>Geometrical</h3>

<p>Based on mathematical formulas. Their contours are always regularized, angular, or hard edges. We are most familiar with these shapes because they are the first shapes we tend to encounter when we are small children.</p>

<p>Straight lines and angular corners create rectilinear, geometric shapes. Circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles are geometric shapes that are crisp and mathematically precise with straight lines and consistent profiles. As you can see, circles and ellipses are also geometric shapes, because they are symmetric and defined by a formula (but we do call them <em>soft</em> geometric shapes).</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignShapesGeometric.png" /></p>

<h3>Organic</h3>

<p>Created or derived from nature and living organisms. These shapes are used more freely than geometric shapes, and are usually irregular and soft. A natural or organic shape <em>can</em> be regular, but that doesn't happen too often. Too much irregularity, on the other hand, tends to convert designs into total chaos quite quickly.</p>

<p>Curvilinear lines typically create these amorphous, organic shapes. As you might have noticed, the three "basic shapes" from which you can built any shape are all part of the geometric group, so shouldn't every possible shape be in that group? Well, sure you can create a flower or squirrel from only basic shapes, but that would take <em>a lot</em> of time and effort. Starting out with rounded shapes that support the feeling of a design is much easier.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignShapesOrganic.png" /></p>

<h3>Random</h3>

<p>Created from invention or imagination, no sense of order, resemblance, or relationship to the other categories of shape. They will borrow subtle characteristics from both categories, but whether these random shapes work out and what feeling they convey is up to you to determine. Random shapes are often heavily abstracted shapes, used for icons, branding or stylizations.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignShapesRandom.png" /></p>

<h2>Positive &amp; Negative Shapes</h2>

<p>We've thus far only looked at adding a shape to the composition, but there's an important process we need to be aware of. Whenever we add a shape, we actually add two shapes! When we place a rectangle in the centre of a page, all the empty space around it (with no shapes in it) is also a shape. Every time you add something to the composition, you create more and more complex empty spaces. The shapes you add yourself are what we call <em>positive shapes</em>, and the empty shapes that come with it are called <em>negative shapes</em>. The negative shape around an element is just as important as the positive shape of the element itself.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignPositiveNegativeShapes.png" /></p>

<p>A better word for negative shape is simply <em>space</em>, as the very definition of that word is "that which has nothing in it". This not exactly true for our negative shapes, as it often contains the background or elements that just don't attract much attention. But, because our eye (at first glance) perceives the negative space as empty, space is a good word to use.</p>

<p>Why then, should we be interested in these spaces? More explanation will come later, but the main idea is that there are often more negative shapes in a composition than positive ones, and it's just as important to make those look good. To some extent, this is accomplished automatically: organic circles will create soft and curved negative shapes, while geometrical squares create angular negative shapes. Nevertheless, consider negative shapes in your design and use them to your advantage by actively employing them as a design element.</p>

  title: "[Design] Form"
  post: "<p>Stepping up our game, we arrive at the biggest elements with as much as three dimensions. Whereas a shape has a two-dimensional character, form is three-dimensional, having width, height and depth. However, because we can't draw 3D shapes on paper or on the computer, form is merely a collection of shapes creating the illusion that an object has <em>mass</em> or <em>volume</em>. Form is what happens when multiple shapes come together in an elegant way to create a bigger element with more dimensions.</p>

<p>Creating this illusion of three-dimensional space is a very important aspect of any design, as it creates a sense of depth, realism and naturalness. Adding that third dimension makes some elements seem to pop out of your design, and some to recede. Adding depth adds a texture and dynamic quality to a design, even though the page is still flat.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignFormOverview.png" /></p>

<h2>Types of Forms</h2>

<p>Forms can be real or illusory. Real form contains actual volume or physical weight, and are three-dimensional objects such as sculpture, architecture, and packaging. Illusory two-dimensional forms are perceptual, and give the illusion of three-dimensional space through several graphic conventions. Because this is a course on graphic design displayed on a web page, I will focus on the latter.</p>

<h2>Basic Forms</h2>

<p>Just as we used basic shapes, we can use basic forms to establish any form. These basic forms are direct extensions of the basic shapes; squares becomes cubes, circles become spheres, triangles become pyramids.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignFormBasic.png" /></p>

<h2>Projections</h2>

<p>When we convert a complex three-dimensional form into two-dimensional shapes, we say we <strong>project</strong> it onto a flat surface. There are multiple types of projections available to do so:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Isometric: </strong>Easiest of projection methods where three visible surfaces of a form have equal emphasis. All axes are simultaneously rotated away 30 degrees from the picture plane and kept at the same angle, all lines are equally foreshortened, and the angle between lines is consistent.</li>
	<li><strong>Axonometric: </strong>An axonometric (<em>plan oblique</em>) projection is a projection of a form viewed from a skewed direction, to reveal more than one of its sides in the same picture plane. To achieve this, axes are rotated 45 degrees.</li>
	<li><strong>Linear Perspective: </strong>Realistic perspective, but also the hardest to do. It simulates optical distortions, making near objects appear large as far objects become small. The angle at which objects recede reflects the position of the viewer. Parallel lines converge in the distance or at the horizon.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignFormProjections.png" /></p>

<p>(If you really want to fully understand linear perspective, I suggest you read the corresponding chapters from the <strong><em>drawing course</em></strong>.)</p>

<p>In contrast to linear perspective, isometric and axonometric projections depict volume without making elements recede into space; the result is often more abstract and impersonal. Additionally, all vertical lines remain vertical and all parallel lines remain parallel---which isn't realistic, but people still understand the spatial meaning.</p>

<h2>Principles of Depth</h2>

<p>Aside from those projections, there are other visual cues that signal the viewer that depth of three dimensions are present in a design. These can---and should---be combined with projections, but can also be used outside of them. For example, you can make a bunch or circles seem to have depth simply by adding shadow behind them, in which case you don't need to project anything.</p>

<p>The visual cues suggesting three-dimensional objects are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Overlapping:</strong> The object that is being overlapped seems farther away than the object that is overlapping it.</li>
	<li><strong>Size:</strong> Smaller objects are perceived to be farther away.</li>
	<li><strong>Height:</strong> The object higher up the page is perceived to be farther away.</li>
	<li><strong>Texture:</strong> When a surface texture varies in density, areas of greater density are perceived to be farther away than areas of lesser density.</li>
	<li><strong>Shading:</strong> Shaded areas are perceived farthest away from the light source, and light areas as closest.</li>
	<li><strong>Atmospheric Perspective:</strong> Objects that are bluer and blurrier are perceived to be farther away. Alternatively, if some components of the design are extremely close to the viewer and not the main point of attention, you can blur them to make the design easier to look at.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignFormVisualCues.png" /></p>

<p>Of all these cues, <em>overlapping</em>, <em>size</em>, and <em>shading</em> are by far the most important. In the real world, the surfaces of a form curving or facing away from the light appear darker than surfaces facing towards it. This effect suggest the rounding of a two-dimensional shape into a three-dimensional form.</p>

<p>Although shading seems like a difficult and elaborate process, light and shadow can be expressed in lots of different and simple ways, which will add a lot to any design. Therefore, next chapter will be about the first property we can alter on our design elements, which is <em>Light</em>.</p>

  title: "[Design] Light"
  post: "<p>Without light, we would see nothing. When we look at something, there'll always be some light that is acting on it, and the kind of lightning heavily influences the look, mood, and interpretation of a design. Because we're so used to always having one or multiple sources of light, a design is aesthetically pleasing when it doesn't contradict the rules of light, but instead uses them to establish hierarchy and order. On top of that, light automatically creates the illusion of depth, and helps with one of the most important principles of design: <em>contrast</em>.</p>

<h2>Types of Light</h2>

<p>As you start with your design piece, you'll need to establish the light source(s) working on it. Arbitrarily applying lighting to every element is never a good idea, as it would create inconsistencies and confuse your audience about the setting and environment of the design. Every light source has a few properties you need to figure out: <strong>position</strong>, <strong>strength</strong> and <strong>colour</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignLightProperties.png" /></p>

<p>The <em>position</em> is the placement in the three-dimensional world. The light can be above all elements, in between them, behind, in front---whatever you want. Objects with top-down lighting look natural and friendly, while objects with bottom-up lighting look unnatural and scary. In general, it's also preferred to have a light source shining from an angle, instead of straight down at objects.</p>

<p>The <em>strength</em> is the amount in which the light influences its surroundings. A weak light (such as a light bulb) only affects the elements nearest to it, and only adds a little bit of contrast. A strong light (such as the sun) affects all elements in the exact same way, and is very apparent. A weak light creates shadows and highlights with very soft edges, while a strong light creates hard edges.</p>

<p>The <em>colour</em> of the light is, obviously, what colour light waves the light emits. The sun shines with yellow/white light, which is good, as it shows every object in its true colours. But, for example, a blue light sets a much grimmer or darker mood, while a red light creates the sensation of warmth and sunset.</p>

<h2>Visual Cues for Light</h2>

<p>How then, do we create these illusions of light in our designs? Well, just as with the illusion of three-dimensional form, there are certain visual cues we can employ.</p>

<p>Light shows itself through <strong>highlights</strong> (where light hits the object directly) and <strong>shadows </strong>(places the light can't reach). No matter what colour an object is, its highlights will have a higher brightness, and its shadows a lower brightness than usual. We call the amount an element is in the light or shades its <strong>value</strong>.</p>

<p>The most apparent shadow of any object is its <em>cast shadow</em>, which is a shadow cast on surrounding elements. Technically, this means that it isn't part of the element anymore, as the actual value difference happens on the other affected elements. I think it's important to realize this property of light, as it binds elements together and can create unexpected shapes.</p>

<p>The <em>highlight</em> on objects is often smaller and less obvious, but it still excites strong feelings of power, brilliance, fluorescence, and amplitude.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignLightHighlightsShadows.png" /></p>

<p>The general rule is that elements of higher value draw attention or add emphasis. By adding a smooth transition between the light and dark parts of an element (a <em>gradient</em>), we invite the viewer's eye to then follow that path, helping us direct the viewer around the design.</p>

<h2>Transparency</h2>

<p>The other important visual cue is <em>transparency</em>, sometimes called <em>opacity</em> or <em>alpha</em>. When an element is transparent, we can see through it (to some degree). When an element is opaque, which most elements in the real world are, we can't see through it at all.</p>

<p>The important thing to notice is that an element can only be transparent if there's light acting on it! When a transparent object overlays another object, the light waves that return to our eyes are a mix of the colours and textures of both objects. Therefore, more transparency creates a stronger sense of lighting.</p>

<p>You must be careful, however, not to overdo it. Most objects in the real world aren't transparent (I mean, can you name anything transparent besides glass?), and ignoring that fact in your designs could turn it into a big, artificial mess.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignLightTransparency.png" /></p>

<p>Nevertheless, transparency is a good method for adding multiple layers of complexity to a design, and overlapping shapes while still being able to see both of them. It's effective in creating depth, without sacrificing visual data.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this means that transparency is rarely suited for the purpose of clarity, but instead used to create dense, layered imagery. Transparency connects the two (or more) objects that mix, and automatically combine or contrast them. Our brain simultaneously perceives both objects at different spatial locations---sometimes one seems in front of the other, sometimes it's the other way around. This adds to the visual intrigue of a design, but is a bad idea for efficient or simple designs.</p>

  title: "[Design] Scale"
  post: "<p>At first, I wanted to call this chapter <em>size</em>, but then I realised that wouldn't be entirely correct. Following <em>light</em>, how large or small an element is determines most of its message. However, size is fixed, but <em>scale</em> is relative. When you put a gigantic square on the canvas, it still feels relatively small when you put even larger squares next to it. The exact size you eventually give elements should be a result of the relationships between elements, which means you should think of elements as being scaled larger or smaller with respect to other elements in the composition.</p>

<p>Another distinction has to be made, however, between scale and proportions. While this chapter looks only at the size of one design element, proportions look at the differences or ratios between the scale of <em>all</em> the elements on the page, including negative space or white space. The two concepts are directly linked, and you'll see many more principles applied in the <em>Proportions</em> chapter, but I just wanted to already mention some key concepts here to get you started.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignScaleVersusSize.png" /></p>

<h2>The Meaning of Scale</h2>

<p>A design whose elements all have a similar size generally feels dull and static, lacking in contrast and hierarchy. To improve our designs, we want to use scale to convey a sense of depth and movement, and draw attention to our focus points.</p>

<p>Large elements seem to pop off the page and convey a surprising sense of scale. Smaller elements tend to recede and seem further away. This creates a sense of depth, but bigger elements don't always have to draw attention. A small element surrounded by a vast amount of space is equally effective.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignScaleEmphasizing.png" /></p>

<p>Besides creating depth, scales inherently create a hierarchy and rank among elements. When other variables are kept constant, the largest elements will seem first in rank and most important, and the smallest last and least important.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignScaleHierarchy.png" /></p>

<p>Scale is also a property of elements you can change over time. By gradually making an element bigger and bigger, you can make it seem like its moving towards you. Conversely, by making it smaller and smaller, it seems to move out of sight. Even when applied subtly, this is a very effective way for making designs more dynamic.</p>

<p>Because scale is so dynamic, it can be used to direct the viewer's eye towards certain elements. By gradually changing the scale of elements, you imply a line running through the elements, pointing towards something else.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignScaleProgression.png" /></p>

<h2>Objective versus Subjective Scale</h2>

<p>The reason scale is so dependent on context, is that we automatically make comparisons whenever we receive sensory input. In order to understand new things, we compare it to things we already know or have already seen. This can be other elements of the design, but will at first glance most likely be personal memories of the viewer.</p>

<p>We differentiate two types of scale:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Objective:</strong> The actual, literal size of an element expressed in some globally accepted unit. When relation to an object's size in real life is important---such as with maps or architectural plans---objective scaling is necessary. One needs to measure the lengths of lines in the real world, and use a fixed ratio to convert that to a line within the design.</li>
	<li><strong>Subjective:</strong> Refers to a person's impression of the object. For humans, a house may seem incredibly large. For ants, humans are huge. When working with objects viewers might be familiar with, keep into account how they may feel about the relationship in scale. Depicting a woman and a house next to each other as if they were equally big may work in abstract cases (such as icons), but not when you're trying to be more realistic or concrete.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignScaleObjectiveSubjective.png" /></p>

<p>A direct consequence of this, is that scaling something disproportionately leaves the viewer confused and uncomfortable. Within objects in the real world, there's a relationship between their width, height, and depth. On the paper, this results in a fixed relationship between width and height. A guitar viewed from the front, for example, is far wider than it is high, which means depicting it differently looks odd and unnatural.</p>

  title: "[Design] Texture"
  post: "<p>Up until now we've only seen shapes filled with one flat colour, but that is soon to change. Whether you like it or not, almost nothing in the real world is just a single flat, evenly coloured surface. Every object has a certain <em>texture</em>, a certain look and feel created by the bumps and grooves in its surface. The material of which objects are made, as well as the process through which it was made, are the reason you'll rarely find two identical objects, even when they have the same form. For example, a ball of glass will look very different from a ball used to play soccer.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignTextureOverview.png" /></p>

<p>Not only do textures increase the richness, beauty and interestingness of a design, they also make it feel more realistic, natural, and comfortable. Even sharp textures in a design (perhaps used to convey a sense of violence or danger) are deemed better than no texture at all. This doesn't mean, however, that you should start applying as much special textures as you can to all elements. As always, <em>contrast</em> between areas of texture and no texture (or other textures) is the best way to go. Instead, I want to talk you through all the different types of textures and what feelings they evoke.</p>

<h2>Three Types of Texture</h2>

<p>In general, we can put a texture into one of these three categories.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Physical</strong> (or literal): Actual tactile variation on an object's surface. Examples are wood, sand, fur, or canvas. It's three dimensional, which means it can be felt, and the look of the texture is determined by how light acts on it. Rough surfaces reflect light very differently than smooth surfaces, glossy material looks different than matte, fabric can be nubby or fine.</li>
	<li><strong>Visual</strong>: The illusion of real-life texture, created by our familiar points, lines, and shapes. It can't actually be felt, but it looks as if it were real and tactile, and as if it has depth.</li>
	<li><strong>Abstract</strong> (or implied): Texture that doesn't resemble any material from the real world. This doesn't mean that it's random or ugly; it simply means that it's not something you'd just find lying around as you stroll through the park. For example, a field of text is an interesting texture as well, just as a bunch of circles overlapping.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignTextureTypes.png" /></p>

<p>As you can see, to fill an element with texture, you simply need to combine all the basic elements we've already seen in an elegant way. You can base your textures on real life materials, or abstracted versions of it, or invent them yourself.</p>

<p>The most important thing to notice is that, if you're working on digital design, you'll always start with flat shapes and no texture, whereas in product design every material you'll use has a default texture attached to it. This means that different mediums ask for a different approach towards textures; with one you'll have to be careful about the textures that come with your materials, and try to minimize their conflicts, while the other requires you to actively think <em>would this benefit from a texture?</em></p>

<h2>Feeling the Texture</h2>

<p>Texture can be used to establish a mood, or convey a sense of physical presence. Every texture adds richness and detail to any composition, but its impact and power depend on the surrounding textures. Textures add overall surface quality, as well as reward the eye when viewed up close.</p>

<p>Rough textures are visually active and kinetic. Smooth textures are passive and calm. Other characteristics of textures depend on the characteristics of the elements involved (lines and shapes), as well as the material that is being used or visually replicated. Wood always has a comfy and natural feeling to it, while metal is harsher and colder. Typography, perhaps, has the most interesting and varied texture of all---if, and only if, you apply it well.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignTextureFeelings.png" /></p>

<p>You could look at texture as being descriptive adjectives in visual communication. Appropriate and meaningful texture can give the simplest visual element resonance and a spark of life. Effective use of texture can connect a variety of emotions and messages to simple shapes.</p>

<h2>Creating Texture</h2>

<p>Of course, there isn't one golden method to create every texture. Some textures have a high degree of contrast and are built from relatively large elements; others are low contrast and have a fine, delicate grain created from lots and lots of small elements.</p>

<p>A good texture is one with a familiar and recognizable pattern, but enough variation to not make it look too artificial, formal or cold. Confusion is bad, but "perfect regularity"---continual, relentless repetition---is even more horrifying. Life needs a mixture, a balance between regularity and chaos.</p>

<p>Therefore, the best way to create a texture is by building it from the ground up, overlapping layers and layers of the same set of elements.</p>

<p>Because of that, creating physical textures is a result of, for example, adding multiple brushstrokes on top of each other, or putting several layers of the same material on top of each other in different ways. Non-physical textures can be created by establishing a basic, recurring shape or line, and copying multiple times, slightly adjusting it in scale, rotation and placement every time. Of course, there's also always the option of using images as textures, although it might be hard to incorporate them well into a design.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignTextureCreation.png" /></p>

<p>Depending on where your light is coming from, you can use darker and lighter tones of an object's colour to signal grooves and bumps in the surface. While this process often takes some time, the result will---more often than not---be a surprisingly realistic texture.</p>

<p>And lastly, because text is such an interesting texture, a popular method for creating texture (among designers, anyway) is by solely using text. The legibility isn't necessarily important; the visual texture it creates is.</p>

  title: "[Design] Pattern"
  post: "<p>Perhaps the simplest, yet most effective form of texture is a <em>pattern</em>. Because it's so powerful and found nearly everywhere in design, I've dedicated a whole chapter to it.</p>

<p>A pattern, just as a texture, is achieved when points, lines, and shapes combine into something that subverts the identity of the separate elements in favour of a larger texture. In other words, the individual elements become unnoticeable and give away the attention to the larger texture that appears.</p>

<p>What's different about patterns, is that they are <em>perfect</em>. Instead of adding subtle variations or changing the colours here and there, a pattern is a consistent, undisrupted collection of repeated elements. Because of this, a pattern---even though it may consist of maybe hundreds of smaller elements---can be seen as one individual design element within a composition.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignPatternOverview.png" /></p>

<h2>Repetition</h2>

<p>Humans are always subconsciously seeking for patterns. Patterns are noticed and interpreted quickly, which means they can attract attention and create interesting visuals. On the other hand, repetition of a simple basic pattern is predictable and boring, and can make elements automatically recede into the background.</p>

<p>Either way, every pattern is the result of <strong>repetition</strong>; actually, it's the result of two kinds of repetition. The fundamental element of the pattern is repeated in a consistent and fixed way, without variation or change. This fundamental element, on the other hand, is created by picking a small set of basic design elements, and copying them while making (slight) adjustments every time, creating endless variations and complexity.</p>

<p>There are five common properties you could change to get a new configuration for every new copy: <em>placement</em>, <em>rotation</em>, <em>size</em>, <em>colour</em>, and <em>shape</em>. The last two are a bit trickier, and you'll need to make sure you don't change too much, or the contrast within one fundamental piece of the pattern is too big and makes it fall apart.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignPatternFundamentalElement.png" /></p>

<p>Obviously, you shouldn't just randomly start repeating everything. Every pattern follows some repetitive principle, be it a <em>grid</em>, (computer-generated) <em>algorithm</em>, or <em>physical rhythm</em> found in nature.</p>

<p>For example, in real-life flora we can find lots of <em>fractals</em>. The idea behind them is simple: every step, you copy an existing element two times, place them at the end of the previous element, and reduce their size by a fixed ratio. The results are often pretty pictures.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignPatternFractals.png" /></p>

<p>Note, though, that modifications aren't absolutely necessary. Lots of patterns are actually better when copies aren't altered, because they are simpler. Nevertheless, when you <em>do</em> make modifications, make sure it's <em>always</em> in an organized and structural manner, or the pattern becomes a chaotic texture.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Good Pattern</h2>

<p>You should see patterns as minimalist textures. When overtly decorative surfaces don't suit your design's purpose or make the whole composition too chaotic and complex, they are often better replaced with much simpler patterns.</p>

<p>Interesting pattern designs often result from a mix of regular and irregular forces, as well as abstract and concrete or recognizable imagery. A pattern should have a strong relationship to geometry, as it's a repetition of fundamental elements in a predictable and organized manner. Due to this underlying structure, patterns are always synthetic, man-made, and mechanical---never organic.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it's actually recommended to <em>draw ideas</em> from organic textures. Some common patterns to explore are: arabesques, branching, circulation, helixes, lattices, meanders, nests, spheres, spirals, symmetry, volutes and waves.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignPatternOrganic.png" /></p>

<p>Patterns are best when they are as simple as possible. When patterns become too complex, they create the illusion of complete randomness. If you really want your pattern to be complex, structure can be recovered by tiling the pattern using seamless tiles.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignPatternSeamless.png" /></p>

<p>In the rest of this course, patterns will be referred to as <strong>motifs</strong>, just as a motif is a recurring element or object in books and stories.</p>

  title: "[Design] Mass"
  post: "<p>We have so far looked at the most important properties of elements we can change to improve a design, and we've also seen that <em>depth</em> is a very important factor. Only depth, however, doesn't necessarily mean anything; we could create a nice three-dimensional sphere, but if it has no <em>mass</em>, it still feels lifeless, flat, and unimportant. A solid form weighs heavier---literally as well as metaphorically---in a design than a see-through or air-filled one. A two-dimensional shape is perceived as a paper-thin element with no mass, while a three-dimensional form automatically receives more mass.</p>

<p>The principle of mass is a bit of a vague one at the beginning, but perhaps also the most important, as it encompasses all previously mentioned principles---so bear with me.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignMassOverview.png" /></p>

<h2>Force</h2>

<p>Something with a bigger mass, has a bigger force acting on it. In physics, force is calculated as <em>mass</em> times <em>acceleration</em>, and that relationship right there is just as important in design.</p>

<p>Something with a solid or heavy mass will draw your attention to it, but also makes you feel more uncomfortable and restless. The forces acting on it are too strong to allow your eyes to rest or focus. On the other hand, something with a light mass will recede more into the background, but is easier and more comfortable to look at for a while. Big media with less content seems lighter in mass, while small elements with too much content seem heavier.</p>

<p>For example, a body of text is much easier to read when the line height is bigger, which means there's much more white space between subsequent lines. If you want to attract attention or establish a starting point for reading the text, however, you usually employ big and bold headlines within a small amount of space.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignMassForces.png" /></p>

<p>There are several forces we encounter in nature on a day to day basis, which we subconsciously read into designs as well. The strongest and most obvious one is <strong>gravity</strong>, accompanied by <strong>motion</strong> and <strong>tension</strong>. Of course, there's many more forces, such as electromagnetic and friction, but all of those aren't really directly applicable to graphic design. (Although, one could study "friction" as a negative force when it comes to User Experience design. The more friction between design and user, the less likely somebody is to like and/or use that design.)</p>

<h2>Gravity</h2>

<p>Even though it's essentially the same force, for our design purpose we can distinguish between two types of gravity: the gravity of the earth that pulls objects towards the ground, and the fact that every physical body attracts all bodies around it. Because most objects in our world are really small, we don't actively notice the second type, but we can see its effect on a larger scale; for example, the sun attracts all the planets around it, forcing them to circle around her.</p>

<h3>Downward Gravity</h3>

<p>The force we see in action every day, is the gravity that pulls us and everything around us to the ground. We're used to it, and we expect things with reasonably large mass to quickly drop to the ground. In order to give your design elements more depth and realism, you should keep this illusion of mass in place.</p>

<p>As a result, the bottom half of a picture feels heavier, sadder, or more threatened and constrained; objects placed in the bottom half feel more "grounded".</p>

<p>On the contrary, the upper half of a picture is a place of freedom, happiness, and triumph; objects placed in the top half often feel more "spiritual". An object placed higher up on the page has "greater pictorial weight"; our attention is drawn to the object more, or it feels more important, because it is perceived to have a high mass.</p>

<p>Think of it this way: there's a reason the nasty fine print is always at the bottom of a page.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignMassDownwardGravity.png" /></p>

<p>Again, the idea comes from physics. When an object is held up in the air, it receives extra potential energy proportional to its mass, whilst standing on the ground makes the object static, seemingly without mass.</p>

<p>Consider this example of a bunch of dots, with one placed higher on the page. Doesn't it seem like that dot is jumping, doesn't it attract your attention? Of course, there are other design principles at play as well, but we somehow automatically assume the other dots are at some sort of ground level, and that the other is defying gravity. When we turn it around, though, the effect feels much weaker.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignMassJumpingDots.png" /></p>

<h3>Spherical Gravity</h3>

<p>Spherical gravity simply means that objects attract elements in a circle around it towards its centre point. Objects with more mass---which are usually just extremely large elements---display a stronger gravitational effect, and seem to pull elements in their neighbourhood towards themselves, essentially grouping multiple elements together. Elements of lighter mass don't portray this effect, unless its compensated by a large distance between itself and its surrounding elements.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignMassSphericalGravity.png" /></p>

<p>The most obvious case is the fact that the centre of a page is automatically the focus point (if no other elements reposition this focus point). There's a reason we say things are the "centre of attention". This effect can actually work against you, if you want your viewers to see more of the design than just its centre. It's your job, therefore, to be aware of this effect and redirect the viewer's eyes towards other elements on the page.&shy;</p>

<h2>Motion &amp; Tension</h2>

<p>By creating the illusion of motion, we can direct a viewer's eyes around a piece and make it more dynamic. We've already seen lots of ways to do so, and will see many more, but I just wanted to point out the relationship with mass here. A heavier object takes more force to move. When using motion within your piece, make sure you apply the principle to elements with light pictorial weight---otherwise it just asks too much of the user's attention or energy.</p>

<p>Similarly, tension will be discussed in further detail later, but it's essentially the invisible force connecting two elements---or, rather, connecting the space or elements between them. Two similar and heavy elements spaced apart will create tension on the direct line between them, pointing your eyes towards that line and actually drawing attention away from themselves. Elements of light weight don't have the same effect.</p>

  title: "[Design] Hierarchy"
  post: "<p>Now that we've discussed the fundamental visual elements, and each of their properties, we can move on to the bigger picture: placing all the elements together within the same design, without turning it into complete chaos. Expressing order is the central task of the graphic designer. Without it, graphic communication is flat, boring and difficult to navigate.</p>

<p>The keyword to making any design good, is <em>hierarchy</em>. To reduce chaos, we need to (visibly) put things into groups and establish relationships between every pair of elements on the page. And as we create those relationships, we create a hierarchy; what is the most important element in the design? What is the least important element in design? How do we make every headline important, and in doing so attract attention towards the piece of text below it?</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignHierarchyOverview.png" /></p>

<p>Because this is the all-important age-old question within design, one chapter isn't enough to explain it. From now on, all chapters will explain one very important design principle. You'll notice that these principles are all based on one thing: how the human brain works and eyes observe. These principles are the result of a basic understanding about how people perceive certain visual stimuli, and you should think about design that way as well; what can I do to make people interpret a flat picture or design as more than just that, and how do I make them interpret it the way I intended?</p>

<p>Remember that design isn't (necessarily) art; the first and foremost function of design is to communicate the same message to every user, its secondary function is to make it visually appealing or interesting. Usually, if you work on getting your hierarchy right, the visual elements will automatically fall into place.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignHierarchyPyramids.png" /></p>

<h2>Tools of Hierarchy</h2>

<p>All the tools you need for hierarchy, is everything we've already discussed! To create structure, you can use: points, lines, position, orientation, size, colour, typography, texture, patterns, mass, and shape. Hierarchy employs these clear marks of separation to signal a change from one level to another.</p>

<p>For example, if you have an equal amount of square elements and round elements in the design, the squares will automatically be grouped together in the viewer's mind, and will be the first to attract attention because of their sharp outlines.</p>

<p>Good, small examples for studying hierarchy are <em>table of contents</em>. A poorly designed table of contents uses conflicting or contradictory alignments, redundant numbering systems, and an overall graphical clutter. Analyse table of contents to get a good grip on hierarchy. (But, as this is more of a typography issue, check the <em>Typography</em> course for those kinds of things!)</p>

<p>One thing to pay attention to is <strong>dimensional hierarchy</strong>. When your design is three-dimensional, you have the added challenge of legibility across and around curved planes. Three-dimensional objects are bathed in light and shadow, and you need to take those into account in your hierarchy as well.</p>

  title: "[Design] Gestalt Principles of Perception"
  post: "<p>The first step for creating hierarchy, is grouping. Grouping serves to both combine and separate. As a process of combining, grouping transforms elements into larger elements. As a process of separating, grouping serves to break down large and complex objects into smaller, simpler ones.</p>

<p>Once elements are grouped, we can use principles to assign a ranking that shows how important groups are in relation to each other. This chapter will talk about all the ways to group elements, which were formulated as part of a study on the psychology of perception, and which are called the <em>principles of Gestalt</em>.</p>

<p>There are eight of them: <em>proximity</em>, <em>similarity</em>, <em>closure</em>, <em>symmetry</em>, <em>common fate</em>, <em>continuity</em>, <em>good gestalt</em> and <em>past experience</em>. (The first six, however, are the most important.)</p>

<p>NOTE: Most of these principles are elaborated on later in the course, because they are just too important to quickly glance over.</p>

<h2>Proximity</h2>

<p>Elements close to each other are perceived as related and grouped. Elements far apart are perceived as dissimilar and unrelated.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignGestaltProximity.png" /></p>

<h2>Similarity</h2>

<p>Similar elements are automatically perceived as a group. In order for this to work, of course, there need to be different elements within the design. It's also not necessary for elements to be identical; by rotating or slightly changing an element, there still appears to be a connection with the other similar elements, as long as the change is not too big. Similarity will generally overpower the other Gestalt principles.</p>

<p>Two strategies for applying similarity in a design, which are also related to proximity, are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Common Regions:</strong> Formed when edges come together and bound a visual area, grouping the elements within it. Useful for grouping text elements and clusters of control elements.</li>
	<li><strong>Connecting Lines: </strong>When an explicit line joins elements, grouping the connected elements. Useful for grouping individual elements and implying sequence.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignGestaltSimilarity.png" /></p>

<h2>Closure</h2>

<p>Incomplete objects (with holes or gaps) are automatically completed by the viewer's eye. This means that the mind automatically groups several elements with space between them into one big element. For this to work, of course, the object can't be destroyed too much.</p>

<p>Closure is strongest when elements approach simple and recognizable patterns, such as geometric forms, and are located near one another. This principle enables designers to reduce complexity and the number of elements needed. Not completing some of your lines also increases interest---viewers subconsciously participate with the design.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignGestaltClosure.png" /></p>

<h2>Symmetry</h2>

<p>The mind automatically perceives objects as symmetrical and forming around a centre point. Not only is it perceptually pleasing to make elements symmetrical, when multiple elements seem to be symmetrical around the same centre point, the mind will automatically group them together.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignGestaltSymmetry.png" /></p>

<h2>Common Fate</h2>

<p>Elements moving in the same direction are perceived to be more related than elements moving in different directions or stationary elements. This refers to elements that imply motion, as well as elements that actually move (like a video or animation)</p>

<p>The effect is strongest when motion occurs in exactly the same amount of time and velocity, and in the exact same direction. Moving objects will be perceived as foreground, and stationary objects as background.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignGestaltCommonFate.png" /></p>

<h2>Continuity</h2>

<p>When multiple elements come together and sections are mixed, we still perceive them as separate elements, <em>if</em> they are formed along a straight line or smooth curve. When parts of elements intersect, good continuation leads the eye to continue along the visible elements. As the angle becomes more acute, the elements will be perceived as less related. In other words, our brain assumes shapes to continue the way they usually do when we can't actually see it.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignGestaltContinuity.png" /></p>

<h2>Good Gestalt</h2>

<p>Elements tend to be grouped together if they form a pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly. When presented with a set of elements that can be interpreted in multiple ways, people will interpret it in the simplest way. (Fewer rather than more elements, symmetrical rather than asymmetrical, and so on.)</p>

<p>Minimize the number of elements in a design to reduce extra cognitive effort needed from viewer. Favour symmetrical composition when efficiency is priority, and asymmetrical compositions when interestingness is priority.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignGestaltGoodFigure.png" /></p>

<h2>Past Experience</h2>

<p>Past experiences help group or separate elements. We know from experience that a word consists of multiple letters, even though one could interpret it as one large symbol when looking from a distance. Change the way people group or separate elements in your design by giving them a certain experience at the start, or relying on what you assume to be common knowledge.</p>

  title: "[Design] Figure-Ground"
  post: "<p>The first step towards ranking the elements in our design, is establishing the <em>figure-ground</em> relationship. I've referred to the distinction between foreground and background several times already, and the term figure-ground is essentially just design language for the same thing.</p>

<p>We all know that the <em>foreground</em> is what attracts attention and contains the actual content of the design, while the <em>background</em> is the space around the foreground that supports it without getting noticed. This means that the largest part of any design will actually be background, which is why it deserves some further investigation.</p>

<p>For example, designs with white or light backgrounds feel safer to us than those with dark backgrounds, because we can see well during the day and only poorly at night. (Of course, there are exceptions.) On the other hand, white maximizes the effort of our colour receptors, while black enables the eyes to rest.</p>

<p>By determining what should be fore- or background, and choosing the graphical style and setup that belongs with them, you've already made a big first step towards any great design. From now on, the foreground will be called <strong>figure</strong>, and the background simply <strong>ground</strong>.</p>

<h2>Figure versus Ground</h2>

<p>Figures are positive shapes, active, and objects of focus. Ground is negative space, passive, and the rest of the perceptual field.</p>

<p>Figures seem to move forward and have a clear position in space, ground recedes and has no clear location. There's only one ground, but there can be multiple figures.</p>

<p>Figures have a definite shape and borders, ground is shapeless and continues behind the figures and beyond the edges of the design.</p>

<p>Elements above the horizon line are more likely to be perceived as figures, while elements below the horizon line are more likely perceived as ground. (Which is quite logical, as the ground comes underneath the sky in the real world. Well, at least as long as you're not tilting your head.)</p>

<p>It's best to use figures for key elements that you want the viewer to be able to recall. Especially familiar, figurative, and representational objects are easy to see and identify as figure.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignFigureGround.png" /></p>

<h2>The Relationship</h2>

<p>There are three basic types of figure-ground relationships:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Simple: </strong>An independent figure is placed on top of the space that represents its ground. The ground can be shallow or have depth. The figure is clearly visible and separate from the ground.</li>
	<li><strong>Reversible: </strong>Figures functions as ground, while ground functions as figure. This graphic inversion takes place because of the shapes that appear within the ground. It's a dynamic way to make neutral empty space more active and engaging in a composition, because positive and negative elements attract our attention equally and alternately.</li>
	<li><strong>Ambiguous:</strong> Graphic relationship between figure and ground is unclear or undetectable. Pairs of objects share the same edge or profile.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignFigureGroundRelationships.png" /></p>

<p>It's important to notice that they are fully dependant on each other. The figure determines the ground, and vice versa.</p>

<h2>Stability</h2>

<p>We say a figure-ground relationship is <strong>stable</strong>, if it's clear what the figure is. We're only focused on the figure, and never the ground. The figure receives more attention and immediacy than the ground. In such cases, the focus point is clear and perceptual confusion is minimized, but it's also potentially boring and static.</p>

<p>When a figure-ground relationship is <strong>unstable</strong>, the figure and ground are ambiguous or reversible. The design can be interpreted in different ways, and tension is created. In such cases, the design is interesting, energetic, and powerful---but, it can also be confusing.</p>

<p>A good design, therefore, seeks balance between figure and ground. Creating some ambiguity or reversible effects to add visual energy and surprise, while at the same time keeping most of the relationship simple. The design becomes active and animated, while still focusing attention.</p>

  title: "[Design] Layering"
  post: "<p>Once the figure-ground relationship has been established, it's time to establish the general hierarchy between smaller groups of elements. The best way to do so, is to use <em>layers</em>.</p>

<h2>What are Layers?</h2>

<p>Layers are simultaneous, overlapping components of an image or sequence. Any design is build up out of multiple layers, and those layers have always been embedded in the process of mechanical reproduction.</p>

<p>A layer contains elements that are visually or logically connected. For example, a layer could hold all the headlines of a page, or it could hold all the elements at the bottom of a three-dimensional design. Layers can be obvious and serve as a graphical element within your design, but most of the time they will just be a useful tool to get structure information for yourself and get where you want.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignLayeringOverview.png" /></p>

<h2>Types of Layers</h2>

<p>Two general types of layers exist: <strong>physical</strong> and <strong>virtual</strong>. <em>Physical</em> layers can be felt, and are a result of building up material in a design (such as cutting and pasting). <em>Virtual</em> layers are structural layers, including the layer systems seen in design software (such as Photoshop).</p>

<p>Additionally, layers can be <em>linear</em> or <em>non-linear</em>. Linear layers have a clear beginning, middle, and end. They are useful for leading or guiding a viewer through a design, telling a narrative. Non-linear layers are useful for reinforcing relationships between layers.</p>

<h3>Linear Layers</h3>

<p>Within the realm of linear layers, these kinds of layers are commonly used:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Sequential: </strong>The simplest layering structure available. Layers are put next to, after, or on top of each other based on their place in the sequence. The layer representing the start of the story is shown first, and the one concluding the story last.</li>
	<li><strong>Temporal</strong>: When working with a sequence of simultaneous events---such as in film or music scores---it's best to create multiple parallel layers. Any other type of (layering) system will most likely only confuse your audience.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Linear Layers</h3>

<p>Within the realm of non-linear layers, four more specific types exist:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Grouping</strong>: Layers that aren't necessarily visible, but in general group elements together. For example, you could decide to cut elements that represent the same thing out of the same material, or you could decide to put elements about the same topic within the same layer in your software. They're sometimes called <em>hierarchical layers</em>, and used---not surprisingly---when information has superordinate and subordinate relationships with each other.</li>
	<li><strong>Typographic</strong>: It's often wise to put textual elements that belong together in the same layer. This could be the case if they're part of the same narrative, or if they all have the same rank of importance.</li>
	<li><strong>Data</strong>: When conveying data or information, multiple overlays are often used. By putting these on different layers you allow users to read levels independently, as well as perceive the connections between the levels. Make sure, though, that those layers are distinct yet follow the same general design style.</li>
	<li><strong>Web</strong>: When information is a network with many different kinds of relationships with itself, revealed by associative linkages to other layers.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignLayeringTypes.png" /></p>

<p>Sometimes, it's also helpful to make a different distinction; between <em>two-dimensional</em> and <em>three-dimensional</em> layers. The first type refers to separating information such that only one layer can be viewed at a time, while the second allows multiple layers to be viewed at any given time (usually through overlapping or transparency). Three-dimensional layers are the most common, and the previous examples already showed what they look like.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignLayeringTwoDimensional.png" /></p>

<h2>Using Layers</h2>

<p>In summary, use layers to structure the information and message you want to send with your design. Then, try to determine if these layers have visual importance you can utilize as well. Either way, keep a well-organized layer structure in mind during every step of the design process. Especially on the computer, dividing your project into useful layers will make your work a lot easier and more efficient.</p>

  title: "[Design] Grid"
  post: "<p>Grids are the basis of every design. Before I introduce any principles to you, I want to show you how behind every great design is a grid, and how you can create and utilize these yourself. I must say, however, that grids aren't <em>mandatory</em> in any way; if you find that a grid is not working for you, abandon it and try something else. Grids exist only to aid and accelerate the design process.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignGridsOverview.png" /></p>

<h2>Why Grids?</h2>

<p>We've already seen that people like patterns and logical structure a lot. A grid is the ultimate tool to achieving such pleasing and understandable designs, while at the same time giving you lots of room for creativity and variation. A well-constructed grid encourages designers to vary scale and placement of elements, without relying solely on arbitrary or whimsical judgments.</p>

<p>A grid provides a starting point, converting a blank canvas into a structured field. By dividing space into numerous equal units, the edges of the composition become just as important as the centre. Grids encourage designers to create open and dynamic compositions without turning it into a complete mess.</p>

<h2>Types of Grids</h2>

<p>So far I've assumed you're familiar with grids being horizontal and vertical lines dividing a composition into smaller and smaller squares. While this is perhaps the simplest and most popular use, there are lots of different types of grids, which all provide the same benefits in their own way.</p>

<p>These five types are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Regular: </strong>The type of grid everybody is familiar with; straight horizontal and vertical lines positioned at regular intervals.</li>
	<li><strong>Angled: </strong>A variation on the regular grid, where horizontal and/or vertical lines are angled instead of straight. A simple but powerful variation on the basic grid. Works best if the angle is bigger than 30 degrees.</li>
	<li><strong>Circular</strong>: Bigger and bigger circles around the centre, accompanied by diagonal lines running through that same centre. Actually quite easy to work with, if you're going for a dynamic and organic design.</li>
	<li><strong>Organic</strong>: Instead of straight horizontal and vertical lines, the lines are curvilinear. Tricky to get right.</li>
	<li><strong>Irregular: </strong>Instead of placing lines or curves at regular intervals, they are placed irregularly. Very tricky to get right.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignGridsTypes.png" /></p>

<p>Of course, you can use even more grids within the global grid, which are called <em>local grids</em>. This is, again, helpful to keep complex designs simple and structured. That, however, will only be the case if those local grids fit well together with the global grid. For example, if you used a regular, rectangular grid for the whole composition, and an irregular local grid on every element, things would still look like they were arbitrarily placed. Local grids are awesome, but watch out you don't take it too far.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignGridsLocal.png" /></p>

<h2>Visibility</h2>

<p>A grid can work quietly in the background, or it can be obvious or clearly visible in a design. In the first case, the grid still influences a lot of the design decision and overall feeling of the composition, but people can't really point out the grid you used from looking at your design. In the second case, the grid becomes an active element within a design, and the visual properties assigned to the grid play an even bigger role.</p>

<p>When a grid works quietly in the background, it provides more flexibility and more opportunities to break out of the grid and do special things. When the grid is clearly visible---which could be by actually drawing it into the composition, or showing parts of it through other elements---you'll need to adhere to it much more. Neither way is better than the other---it's a stylistic choice.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignGridsVisibility.png" /></p>

<h2>Using Grids</h2>

<p>The type of grid you choose to use should naturally come forth from the meaning or narrative of the design. If your style is modern and formal, for example, it would be unwise to choose an organic grid.</p>

<p>The lines and intersections that result from the grid should be used for the <em>position</em> and <em>scale</em> of elements. The lines can be used for the edges of shapes, actually visible lines within the composition, or simply aligning elements. The intersections are usually great places to position or centre elements.</p>

<p>On top of that, grids help you create active and asymmetric compositions, for you can visually balance the elements by counting how many space they take up in the grid. In doing so, grids also provide an opportunity for you to leave more areas open or empty, rather than filling up the whole page.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignGridsUsageExample.png" /></p>

<p>Either way, a designer uses a grid actively and not passively. It's often helpful to let the grid suggest the shapes and placements, instead of doing what's fixed inside your head. Newspapers, for example, use the same grid on every page but with slight variations on the size and position of tiles, as required by the different lengths of articles. Similarly, webpages are dynamic and can extend infinitely vertically, which means the grid used for layout is mainly concerned with horizontal placement and allows the rest to vary.</p>

<p>Lastly, you might be wondering: <em>how do grids help with design that's not printed or on a page?</em> Well, a three-dimensional design still has a surface you can use a grid for. And, if the design consists of multiple three-dimensional objects, you can use a grid on the floor to determine how they should be placed.</p>

  title: "[Design] Contrast"
  post: "<p>Contrast allows our eyes to see; without it, everything would be the same, and we wouldn't be able to distinguish different objects or elements in a design. Our eyes <em>like</em> contrast, which means it's not only necessary for structure and clarity, but it also enhances the aesthetics of a design.</p>

<h2>The Purpose of Contrast</h2>

<p>Therefore, the purpose of contrast is two-fold. First of all, it creates an interesting and appealing design. Secondly, it allows the viewer to instantly recognize the organization and structure of the information within the design. By giving elements near each other completely opposite properties, the eye becomes interested in this design, and it shows that those two elements are certainly not the same and represent a different level within the hierarchy.</p>

<p>By placing a single, small black square somewhere on a uniformly white page, for example, we immediately establish a focal point and make the page more interesting through contrast. By placing something red next to something green (its complementary colour), it becomes even "redder" and more vibrant. A curve becomes even curvier when it's next to something orthogonal and straight.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignContrastOverview.png" /></p>

<h2>How to Create Contrast</h2>

<p>If you are putting two elements on the page that are not the same, they cannot be <em>similar </em>---for contrast to be effective, they must be very different. This is achieved by exaggerating the visual difference of one or multiple properties of both elements. These properties can be anything we've already discussed; size, colour, shape, texture, typeface, orientation, and so on.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignContrastTypes.png" /></p>

<p>The juxtapositions between elements, however, can also be expressed in a more general way; smooth versus rough, geometric versus organic, organized versus chaotic, static versus kinetic. This way, by contrasting more properties, the effect becomes more apparent and immediate.</p>

<p>On the other hand, instead of using contrast to make elements distinct, it can also be used on elements that have some type of relationship to each other or belong together. As long as you use Gestalt grouping or other principles to show the positive relationship, the contrast will enhance this effect instead of working against it.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignContrastWithGestalt.png" /></p>

<h2>Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>

<p>The contrasting elements should never serve to confuse the reader or to create a focus that is not supposed to be one. Contrast can be too light, which seems more like a mistake than a choice. Contrast can also be too heavy, which overwhelms the viewer.</p>

<p>Don't be a coward, be brave! If you're going to contrast, do it with strength. Avoid contrasting a sort-of-heavy line with a sort-of-heavier line. Avoid contrasting black text with brown headlines. Don't be afraid to make words very large or very small; to speak loudly or speak in a whisper. Don't be afraid to make your graphics very bold or very minimal, as long as the result complements or reinforces your design or message. If the items are not exactly the same, make them <em>very</em> different.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignContrastBoldBrave.png" /></p>

<p>Contrast can exist on many obvious and subtle levels in a composition. Not all contrast has to be equally exaggerated, nor does contrast have to use only one property. The human eye can simultaneously detect contrasts in scale, value, shape, direction, and surface---as long as they're large enough.</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>Contrast creates emphasis, importance, weight, or dominance for an element of a composition. A composition lacking contrast may result in visual monotony, neutrality, and even confusion.</p>

<p>Contrasting relationships can be further articulated by combining elements to achieve variety and unity. The ultimate challenge is to create a composition made up of disparate elements that work together as one orchestrated whole.</p>

  title: "[Design] Alignment"
  post: "<p>Following contrast, alignment is the strongest principle. It does the same as contrast, but reversed and more general. Elements that are aligned seem to belong together, even when such an alignment spans across the whole width of a design, and across many elements. Instead of contrasting properties, we're trying to establish hierarchy and increase aesthetics by making elements share a common alignment.</p>

<h2>The Purpose of Alignment</h2>

<p>The main purpose of alignment is to bring order to chaos. As a result, because humans like order, alignment makes a piece of design more visually interesting. Elements that share the same alignment are immediately recognized as having something in common, while elements on a different alignment path are recognized as belonging to distinct groups. By using several common alignment paths, we create <em>unity</em> within a design, leading to cohesiveness and a feeling that all elements in the design are related to each other in some way or another. You don't want your design to feel like it's three different designs mashed together.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignAlignmentOverview.png" /></p>

<h2>How to Create Alignment</h2>

<p>There are two types: <strong>edge alignment</strong> and <strong>area alignment</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Edge Alignment</em> requires elements to be placed such that their edges line up along common rows or columns. Alignment along diagonals is also possible, as long as the angle is more than 30 degrees, otherwise it's too subtle. It might be necessary, though, to highlight diagonal alignment in some other ways as well.</li>
	<li><em>Area Alignment </em>requires elements to be placed such that their centres line up along common rows or columns. When elements have different or complex shapes and can't be aligned by edges, area alignment is the best alternative.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though I only mentioned straight horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines, alignment can be applied just as well to organic curves. In the <em>Grid</em> chapter we saw that we could create circular and organic grids as well, which means your alignments can follow the same pattern <em>if</em> you've chosen to use such a grid for your design. If you chose, for example, a regular grid, it's best to stick with horizontal and vertical alignments.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignAlignmentTypes.png" /></p>

<p>Be conscious of where you place elements; nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Always find something else on the page to align with, even if those elements are far away from each other. When elements can't be close to each other, alignment makes them <em>appear </em>connected, related, or unified with the other information, simply by their placement.</p>

<h2>Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>

<p>In general, prefer edge alignment over area alignment. Use the strongest alignment you can get, which means left, right (or justified), and not centred, unless you're going for a formal or dull design. Area alignment results in ragged edges and sometimes seemingly displaced elements, so use it with care. It is often a <em>strong</em> alignment---combined with the proper typefaces and other elements---that gives a design its sophisticated, formal, fun or serious look.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignAlignmentRags.png" /></p>

<p>There is, in theory, no such thing as too many alignments; no matter how wild and chaotic piece may initially appear, if it's well-designed, you can always find the alignments within. I must say, however, that simplicity is still always better. If you can reduce the amount of alignments to only a few, if you can align one element to multiple already existent paths, do it!</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignAlignmentSimplicity.png" /></p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>Every element should have some visual connection with another element on the page, and alignment is the easiest and strongest way to do so. Choose your alignments consciously and with care, and use it to lead your viewer through a design via the implied lines. Good alignment should go by without viewer's notice, bad alignment is immediately noticed and only good for creating tension or making one specific thing stand out.</p>

  title: "[Design] Proximity"
  post: "<p>Together with alignment, proximity is the second strongest design principle. Simply put, elements that are close together are perceived to be more related than elements that are farther apart. Your eyes only have a limited field of view, and will automatically connect the elements it can easily see, and interpret elements outside or in the corners of their view as disparate.</p>

<h2>The Purpose of Proximity</h2>

<p>Unlike the previous two principles, there's only one purpose to proximity. It groups elements together and organizes, but it doesn't necessarily improve the aesthetics or interestingness of a design. That's the reason why, even though it's very powerful, I've listed it as the third principle. Proximity reduces complexity, and reinforces relationships. Conversely, lack of proximity results in the perception of several disparate chunks, and reinforces differences among elements.</p>

<p>On top of that, proximity can be used to direct the viewer's eye and create points of interest. As explained earlier, groups of elements with close proximity can be seen as a single element with a heavy mass, which attracts attention, but also quickly gives that attention away to something with a lighter mass.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignProximityOverview.png" /></p>

<h2>How to Use Proximity</h2>

<p>Think about what elements belong together, and place those near each other. Similarly, think about what elements certainly don't belong together, and place those far apart.</p>

<p>It helps to squint your eyes slightly, and count the number of visual elements on the page by counting the number of times your eye stops. If there are more than three to five items on the page---of course, it depends on the size and structure of the design piece---see which of those separate elements can be grouped together into closer proximity to become one visual unit.</p>

<p>Proximity can also be interpreted in a more general, thematic way. For example, connecting or overlapping elements are commonly interpreted as sharing one or more common attributes, whereas proximal but non-contacting elements are interpreted as related, but independent.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignProximityMeaning.png" /></p>

<h2>Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>

<p>Avoid too many separate elements on a page. Avoid leaving equal amounts of white space between elements, unless those single elements represent a subgroup by themselves (which means it's the only element on a certain level of the hierarchy).</p>

<p>Avoid even a split second of confusion over whether a headline, subhead, caption, graphic, or whatever, belongs with its related material; actively create this relationship with close proximity. Ensure labels and supporting information are near the elements they describe, use direct labelling on graphs instead of legends.</p>

<p>On the other hand, don't (accidentally) create relationships between elements that don't belong together! If they are unrelated or ambiguously related, move them (relatively) far apart from each other.</p>

<p>And lastly, don't stick things in the corners <em>and</em> in the middle.</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>When several items are in close proximity to each other, they become on visual unit rather than several separate units. Items relating to each other should be grouped together. If the information is organized, it is more likely to be read and more likely to be remembered. As a by-product of organizing the communication, you can also create more organized and appealing white space.</p>

  title: "[Design] Repetition"
  post: "<p>We've already seen the importance of repetition with regard to a single element or single group of elements, such as with patterns and alignment, but now we can take it one step further. Repetition within a design could also just be called <em>being consistent</em>, and in general refers to the fact that designs should be simple and consist of only a few elements that are repeated across the page(s) in many different ways.</p>

<h2>The Purpose of Repetition</h2>

<p>The purpose of repetition is, again, to bring order to chaos. It unifies and strengthens a piece by connecting what would otherwise be separate parts. Repetition is useful on small or single-page designs, but absolutely critical in big or multi-page designs. On top of that, it can create visual interest; if a viewer sees---at a glance---the same odd shape appear once or twice, he will probably look for more instances and see what connects them or what they mean.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignRepetitionOverview.png" /></p>

<p>Repetition gives people a sense of security, and reduces confusion. It also makes a piece come to life; which is why it's also often called <em>rhythm</em>. For example, magazines and websites have the same basic layout with repeated elements---such as the header, footer, colours, and typographic choices---which is adapted to the content that has to fit on any particular page.</p>

<h2>How to Create Repetition</h2>

<p>Constancy is something everybody already does, to some degree. It's easier than the alternative, because it's easier to re-use the same basic building blocks instead of inventing new ones for every design element. To get the most out of repetition, however, you'll need to push those consistencies even further.</p>

<p>First look at the elements you're already repeating. See if you can make them an active part of the composition by making them more prominent. Then, check with the elements whose sole purpose is repetition; lists, tables, and so on. When you're done finding <em>existing</em> and necessary repetitions, and strengthened them, start trying to <em>create</em> new repetitions to make the design clearer and more interesting.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignRepetitionExample.png" /></p>

<p>Of course, repetition should come naturally when you're working off of a grid, which is why I highly recommend doing so. Grids are, in themselves, a pattern made from repetition, and placing elements along the lines or at the intersections will allow you to see other places these exact elements would fit perfectly.</p>

<h2>Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>

<p>Avoid repeating elements so much that it becomes annoying or overwhelming. Be aware of the value of contrast; unless the repeated elements are the most important part of your design, you don't want them to stand out too much, but instead blend in with the rest of the design.</p>

<p>Also, "perfect" regularity---continual, relentless repetition---is even more horrifying than confusion. Life needs a balance between regularity and chaos, between pattern and variation.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignRepetitionVariation.png" /></p>

<p>NOTE: When it comes to repetition, just remember "Less is more, but less is usually at least a few." If that makes sense to you.</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>Repetition creates hierarchy efficiently throughout large design projects. Following patterns while styling creates consistency, as long as you don't overdo it and leave lots of room for creativity and variation. Try to keep your designs as simple as possible, without losing visual interest.</p>

  title: "[Design] Balance"
  post: "<p>The last of the five big principles is actually more of an umbrella principle; <em>balance</em> talks about achieving balance between the previous four principles. And it even goes beyond that, as balance is something that should be achieved in all areas of a design, from colour schemes, to texture, to shape. Balance simply means that no area of the design overpowers other areas---or, at least, not so much that you can't see the other areas anymore.</p>

<h2>The Purpose of Balance</h2>

<p>The purpose of balance is to create a design that feels stable, coherent, and lively. People have a strong sense of weight and balance, as seen in the <em>Mass</em> chapter, and will immediately notice it when something feels off. When a design is not balanced, attention is pulled away from its message and people will be focused on other things instead, or on only one particular aspect of the design.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignBalanceOverview.png" /></p>

<h2>How to Achieve Balance</h2>

<p>Balance is achieved by properly applying all the principles. By applying a principle not too little and not too much, balance is automatically created. By placing not too little nor too many elements on the page, balance ensues.</p>

<p>Symmetry is inherently stable, and perhaps the strongest form of balance, but asymmetric designs can be balanced as well if you manage to contrast other aspects of the design. As mentioned in the <em>Figure-Ground</em> chapter, when figure and ground are balanced, the slight ambiguity between background and foreground adds surprise and visual interestingness.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignBalanceExamples.png" /></p>

<p>Of course, this is quite a subjective principle, and it will require some experience and a lot of trying out to find what works and what doesn't. The best way to achieve balance is just <em>try your best</em>, and then ask friends or colleagues what they think.</p>

<p>One thing to notice though, is that all principles automatically present themselves when using a grid. If you're stuck or don't know what to do, go back to your grid and literally count the size of elements, count the distance between elements, check the alignments and non-alignments between elements, and try to balance it all.</p>

<h2>Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>

<p>There aren't really any pitfalls when it comes to balance. You either have it, or you don't. If you don't, you need to add or remove some elements or properties to achieve it, based on your own observations.</p>

<p>The only thing you need to look out for is that your designs are not balanced in exactly the same way. If you balance everything by symmetry, your design will look formal, static, or even like it's quickly been generated by a computer. Beauty arises from the mix of things; seek rhythms punctuated with change and variation.</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>Balance elements so every part has an equal mass. Don't put too much of one thing in the design, don't put too much of the design in one corner---contrast and balance everything. Balance a heavy area with an area of white space or light mass. Balance a warm, intense colour with a cool, relaxing colour. Balance a complex shape with simple shapes. The list goes on and on, and the possibilities for balance are endless!</p>

  title: "[Design] Proportions"
  post: "<p>Proportion is a way of expressing how the size or magnitude of one thing relates to that of another thing. This could be the length of a line in relation to the length of another line, or the scale of a square in relation to another square, or the height of a circle in relation to the height of a square.</p>

<p>As you can see, these proportional relationships exist within an element itself, and between all elements on the page. Using a proportional scale helps with choosing the size of any element within the design, as well as creating more visually balanced designs. Every element automatically has a certain proportional relationship with regard to another element, whether you want it or not, so it's your job to make sure this relationship makes sense.</p>

<p>Proportions are usually expressed in a mathematical sense, as a ratio between the lengths or sizes of elements. If we say the proportion between two lines is "<em>1:2</em>", we mean that one line is exactly twice as long as the other (and the other way around, one line is exactly half as long as the other).</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignProportionsOverview.png" /></p>

<h2>The Golden Ratio</h2>

<p>Most people have heard of this ratio, as if it were some magical thing you should always adhere too. While the Golden Ratio <em>is</em> a beautiful proportion, which can be found all over classical architecture and paintings, it's not the best ratio for every design. If it's not at the expense of other design objectives, explore the golden ratio, otherwise, try to find a better suited proportion.</p>

<p>So, what is this Golden Ratio? The golden ratio is the ratio between two segments such that the smaller is to the larger, as the larger is to the sum of both. In mathematical terms that becomes a proportion of <strong>1:1.618</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignProportionsGoldenRatio.png" /></p>

<p>The golden ratio pops up everywhere in nature, not only in the length of lines, but also the size of curves, number of leafs, seed patterns in centre of sunflowers, and so on. It is for that reason that we often perceive it as natural and comfortable. Additionally, we feel it's balanced, because of its property that it preserves ratio (smaller to larger is same as larger to sum of both).</p>

<h2>The Root 2 Proportion</h2>

<p>The root 2 proportion is called that way because it refers to the fact that if you divide a square of equal width and height into half diagonally, that diagonal line would have proportion root 2. In mathematical terms, the proportion is <strong>1:1.414</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignProportionsRoot2.png" /></p>

<p>This proportion, therefore, has the property that it maintains its ratio when divided in half. Forever. Again, this means more balance in your design, as smaller and bigger elements will keep exactly the same ratio. Not surprisingly, this proportion is used for standard paper sizes (A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, &hellip;)</p>

<h2>The 2:3 Proportion</h2>

<p>The 2:3 proportion is a result of the human fascination with things that come in threes. Similar to the <em>rule of three</em> in writing, it suggests anything that comes in triples is more visually pleasing. In mathematical terms, the proportion is <strong>1:1.667</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignProportionsTwoThirds.png" /></p>

<p>This proportion has the property that, anytime you have three of something---no matter how you divide them---the proportion stays 2:3. As long as you rigorously stick to this proportion, this property makes it balanced as well.</p>

<h2>The 3:4 Proportion</h2>

<p>Lastly, the 3:4 proportion is a more workable alternative to the 2:3. It still uses that magical number three, but combines it with the four, which allows things to be easily put into squares and grids. In mathematical terms, the proportion is <strong>1:1.334</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignProportionsThreeFourth.png" /></p>

<p>The biggest reason for using this proportion is that it's easily divisible into multiple combinations, making it flexible to work with when constructing grids. Otherwise, this proportion is less balanced and seems to be less visually appealing than the other.</p>

<h2>How to Apply Proportions</h2>

<p>There is no single best proportion. Pick the proportional scale you think is best for your specific design. While we're at it, you also don't have to follow the scale exactly. By skipping multiple steps, you create a <em>varied scale</em>, which adds to the contrast and dynamics of your design.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignProportionsVariedScale.png" /></p>

<p>When it comes to actually applying proportions, it's a simple matter of performing some very simple and quick calculations, every time. When you place a new element on the page, check with the size of another element, and multiply or divide it by the ratio of your proportional scale.</p>

<p>For example, say you were using the golden ratio for your typography. Your biggest headline is 62pt, and you're satisfied with that. Then, your second biggest headline could be 62 / 1.618 = 38pt big. Furthermore, your body text could be 62 / 1.618 / 1.618 / 1.618 = 14pt big. It's fast and simple, but it should provide you with a balanced and good-looking design.</p>

<h2>A Last Note</h2>

<p>One last thing to be aware of, is that the outer dimensions of the medium you use for your design are very important as well. If your design is going to be put on a standard A4 paper, you'll already have the proportions of that paper you need to take into account. It's often best to work with the proportions your medium gives you, but working against it can create interesting visuals if you're up for the challenge. The other way around, if you have an amazing design but don't know what size of paper to put it on, let the proportions decide!</p>

  title: "[Design] Space"
  post: "<p>I intentionally left out any remarks about space in the previous chapter. People often forget the importance of space, and I want to dedicate an entire chapter to the subtleties involved with the concept.</p>

<h2>Horror Vacui</h2>

<p>The Latin phrase <em>horror vacui</em> translates to <em>fear of emptiness</em>, and it's the tendency---instilled into every human being---to fill all the space we have available. Somehow, we favour filling blank spaces with objects and elements over leaving them empty; we often fill our living rooms with lots of stuff, without knowing exactly why we feel the need to do so. We can see this principle in action with budget stores, who fill their entire show window with products and "sale" signs, as opposed to expensive, specialized stores that are for the most part empty and employ minimalistic text. People associate an overcrowded design with restlessness and cheapness, and find it overwhelming and difficult to focus on.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignSpaceOverview.png" /></p>

<p>Essentially, the main take away here is that, if you want your design to look good and promote associations of high value, employ more white space! Dare to leave more empty room, and instead of building on top of your design time and time again, spend some time figuring out what you can <em>remove</em>.</p>

<h2>Types of Space</h2>

<p>Space can actually mean two things; space as in emptiness or an area with no elements in a design, or space as another name for the three-dimensional world (with depth). The second meaning has already been discussed thoroughly in the <em>Form</em> chapter, so this chapter will focus on the first meaning.</p>

<p>We can identify three general types of space:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Physical Space:</strong> In a three-dimensional design, actual empty space between objects. Of course, there's always <em>air</em> between objects, but nothing else.</li>
	<li><strong>Visual Space:</strong> In a two-dimensional design or surface, space between elements where no other element has been placed. Of course, you have to see <em>something</em>, and that would be the (back)ground.</li>
	<li><strong>Pictorial Space:</strong> When designs need to represent an actual physical space, such as maps or building plans for a house, we call it pictorial space. In this case it actually encompasses both meanings of space; we represent a space in the three-dimensional real world with carefully chosen areas of (relative) emptiness in a design.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignSpaceTypes.png" /></p>

<p>In all cases, though, the principles about space hold up. In all cases, as well, you'll always have a background for the empty space. This background could be a white wall, or a complex pattern, or a gradient, or a window---as long as this background is meant to be ground, and not figure within the composition, the concept of space holds up.</p>

<h2>Properties of Space</h2>

<p>Space has a direct relationship with time. When there's space between you and a certain threat, there's time to react to it (or just become scared). When there's space in front of you, you can spend time moving forward. As you can see, space can imply <strong>tension</strong> and <strong>motion</strong>; the same forces we saw earlier in the <em>Mass </em>chapter.</p>

<p>Lots of space isolates a figure. It makes the element alone and free, but also vulnerable, creating tension between itself and whatever other elements are in the design. Overlapping objects violate the space of another, creating tension, but they are also joined together into a single unit.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignSpaceTension.png" /></p>

<p>On the other hand, only a sliver of space is scary as well, as the element can't move. Space allows for movement and brings life to a design; placing elements near each other with progressively smaller or bigger amounts of space implies an element is moving forward/backward in space, or accelerating/decelerating.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignSpaceMotion.png" /></p>

<p>Remember, that space can't be placed on a page like elements---it's a secondary effect of adding the figures, which means it can be unpredictable what happens. Using a grid certainly helps with leaving enough space of the right shape, and using the principles and properties I've outlined should help you even more with using space effectively. When positive and negative space are equal, spatial depth is lacking and a more visually static composition is the result. With space as an active design element, it should come to life.</p>

  title: "[Design] Symmetry"
  post: "<p>The strongest principle of graphic design is <em>balance</em>, which means that the strongest visual property of any element or design is <em>symmetry</em>. On the other hand, there's balance achieved through other properties---such as colour or weight---which we call <em>asymmetry</em>. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, and I'll try to help you choose which one to use for your project in this chapter.</p>

<p>I have to remind you, though, that symmetry or asymmetry can be at many places; it can be within an element, between multiple elements or areas of a design, or across a complete design.</p>

<h2>Symmetry</h2>

<p>Symmetry can be found everywhere in nature, and is inherently balanced and harmonious. Symmetric objects are easy to see and identify, because they are simpler to understand, and are automatically perceived as groups (as seen with the <em>Gestalt principles</em>). They are typically seen as figure, and not ground, which allows them to get more attention and be more memorable. Symmetry of (positive) shapes also has the additional effect that the negative space is symmetric as well.</p>

<p>This makes them seem like the ideal candidate for every design, but symmetrical designs are also often static, stationary, formal, or even dull.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignSymmetryOverview.png" /></p>

<h2>Types of Symmetry</h2>

<p>Three types of symmetry can be distinguished:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Mirroring an element along a <em>mirror line</em>. This could be a central axis, essentially flipping the element, or it could be a line somewhere else. This mirror line can best be horizontal or vertical, but diagonal mirror lines are not unheard of.</li>
	<li><strong>Rotation:</strong> Rotating elements around a common centre point. Again, this can be the centre of the element itself, or some point way outside of it. Any angle and frequency can be used, but regular intervals and a medium angle often work best. Small angles would seem like you made a mistake, while irregular intervals kind of destroys the symmetry.</li>
	<li><strong>Translation:</strong> Locating an equivalent element at another position within the design; a symmetry occurs between two elements, but it's not a reflection, because both elements are oriented the same way.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignSymmetryTypes.png" /></p>

<p>Reflection along a diagonal line and rotation are perhaps the most adventurous and playful, while regular reflection or translation is a little more formal and ordinary.</p>

<p>Symmetry is an especially helpful tool in creating patterns. By copying one or two elements, yet performing a symmetry on them, beautiful patterns automatically start to emerge.</p>

<h2>Asymmetry</h2>

<p>Theoretically, asymmetry is everything that's not symmetry. But, that means total chaos and cluttered design is also included in the definition, which is never what we want. Instead, we want to focus on asymmetrical balance (<em>informal balance</em>), the opposite of symmetry. Instead of balancing elements with the same element, only reflected/rotated/translated, we balance elements with other things. This could be anything; balancing a colour with its complementary colour, balancing an area of heavy weight with areas containing lots of space, balancing lots of sharp shapes with soft, organic shapes, and so on.</p>

<p>Asymmetry fixes all the bad things about symmetry, as it's inherently active, informal, dynamic, and organic. It's a non-systematic and more creative way to achieve balance. Now asymmetry seems like the best thing to do with any design, but there's a big disadvantage: it's much more complex and difficult to achieve. When an asymmetrical composition is disturbingly <em>off</em> balance, the result is automatically jarring and disorienting. That's why it's recommended to start with a little symmetry (such as a grid), and then try to transform parts of the design to asymmetry.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignSymmetryAsymmetry.png" /></p>

<p>Think of it this way: nature mostly consists of symmetry, but there's also something going on called "handedness". We, humans, have symmetrical bodies, yet strongly prefer using one hand over the other. Symmetry makes everyone a little beautiful, handedness makes everyone a little special and unique.</p>

<h2>Types of Asymmetry</h2>

<p>There aren't really any clear-cut types of asymmetry you can employ. The whole idea is that you find your most important, big, dominant element, and then balance or contrast it with lots of smaller, lighter elements.</p>

<p>The process is best visualized as a literal balance scale. Place your focal point or biggest part of the design on one end, and see what amount and what type of elements you need on the other end to balance it out. You could assign a high value to a red element, for example, and low values to blue and purple ones (as they are cooler colours). Similarly, you could assign higher values to sharp shapes than to organic shapes, as the first attracts attention more. Again, contrast is key here.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignSymmetryBalancingScales.png" /></p>

<p>To make the concept more clear, I want to introduce a very effective and popular compositional principle that relies on asymmetry; the <strong>rule of thirds</strong>.</p>

<p>By dividing an area into 9 equal blocks, by drawing three horizontal and three vertical lines, you essentially get 4 intersections around the centre. If you place your dominant element on one of these intersections, you can balance it out by placing contrasting elements (<em>counterpoints</em>) at the opposite intersection.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignSymmetryRuleOfThirds.png" /></p>

<p>Of course, this only works if your dominant element isn't too big or strong; if that's the case, centre it and go for more symmetry.</p>

  title: "[Design] Tension & Motion"
  post: "<p>These principles, <em>tension</em> and <em>motion</em>, have popped up time and time again throughout this course. They aren't a necessary principle or element for a design to work, but they are often what makes a design dynamic and makes us feel like it comes to life. A design could do very well without any implementation of these principles, but I suggest you try to incorporate at least some of it in every design. Additionally, by knowing how they work, you're less likely to accidentally use them in the wrong way.</p>

<h2>Tension</h2>

<p>Perfect tension occurs when two (or more) elements attract each other equally. They pull on each other, contrast each other, or balance each other with equal power. The end result is that none of the elements moves, shifts or changes, but instead creates tension. Because of this, tension is usually a direct result from applying all the principles mentioned earlier, especially contrast.</p>

<p>The difference between tension and just stationary elements, is that tension attracts attention and is a form of imbalance, as the focus point is constantly shifting between the elements in tension. Therefore, if everything is tensed up within a design, it's not balanced and will probably feel uncomfortable; tension needs to be balanced with places of rest, stability and calm.</p>

<p>Remember that tension can be bad thing and a good thing. When you're scared, you're tense, but when you're full of joy or energy, there's also tension in your body. The context---i.e. the other elements within a design---determine what mood the tension conveys.</p>

<h2>Creating Tension</h2>

<p>In this section, I want to give you some more specific guidelines and how tension can be realized, in addition to the principles you've already learned.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bad alignment causes tension. An element that is not in line with the others, actively breaks that line and causes contrast or conflict.</li>
	<li>The edges and the centre of a design are the points of greatest attraction, and elements near it will compete for this attention. The closer something is to the edge or centre, the greater the tension.</li>
	<li>When the figure-ground relationship in a design is ambiguous, tension is created as shapes and forms tend to be foreground one second, and background the next.</li>
	<li>Diagonal shapes, especially multiple diagonal lines that do not all move in the same direction, cause tension. It feels like elements of the design are collapsing or falling over.</li>
	<li>Asymmetrical compositions automatically cause some tension, although it depends on how far you go with the asymmetry.</li>
	<li>Elements extremely far apart or extremely close cause similar levels of tension. The only difference is that elements in close proximity are seen as related or even grouped as a single unit, while elements far apart are naturally regarded as distinct.</li>
	<li>Varying the space between elements creates a dynamic interest, but also tension. Equal and regular spacing creates visual static and uniformity.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignTensionExamples.png" /></p>

<p>Our lives are filled with opposites, and therefore tension. Making those opposites come together and have a conversation with each other, so to speak, makes design much more engaging and meaningful.</p>

<h2>Motion</h2>

<p>Motion occurs when two (or more) elements <em>don't </em>attract each other equally. One is stronger, heavier, and more important than the other. This force causes the other elements to move toward it. Looking at it this way, we need to view elements in a broad sense; the edge of the paper is a design element, and the different properties of an element can imply motion by themselves as well.</p>

<p>Because actual motion isn't really possible in graphic design---as all we're seeing is static images or products---you need to find ways to provide the illusion or feeling of motion. The main purpose of implying motion, then, is to direct the viewer's eyes where you want them to go, and to keep them moving around the design instead of wandering off or focusing on only one aspect.</p>

<p>If you're working with product design, motion of course can also mean actual motion and movable pieces, in which case the same principles hold true; make it clear that something moves and how it moves, and make people inclined to try it out and play with it.</p>

<h2>Creating Motion</h2>

<p>The closest and most effective thing we have to imply motion is repetition or <em>rhythm</em>. By repeating certain elements, yet (progressively) changing some things, we can give the illusion that those changes are actual motion happening in real time. Think of it as music; repeating a fixed set of alterations creates the "tempo" or "beat" of the design. Every element becomes a note, and the white space the silence. The properties of the element determine the kind of note; a high element is a high note, a heavy element is a low, bass-like note, and so on.</p>

<p>You can apply this any way you like. For example, if you see a line of rectangles with progressively larger amounts of space between them, you're inclined to follow it and get the feeling a single rectangle is moving along the paper. If you repeat a set of circles, and one of them has a different vertical placement, it seems as though that circle is jumping.</p>

<p>Lines are critical to implying motion. Multiple diagonal lines going in the same direction show motion and direct the viewer's eye towards whatever it is they're pointing towards. The same is true for a pointed, triangular shape. Rectilinear lines appear static, while sinuous lines appear to flow.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignMotionExamples.png" /></p>

<p>All in all, structured variety is the keyword. Let properties and elements flow on a fixed scale to give a feeling of rhythm and constant motion, but make sure you don't overdo it and make the design piece too energetic and chaotic. Variety in a single beat can come from making things progressively larger or smaller, but irregular, asymmetric, or exaggerated beats can be applied just as well.</p>

  title: "[Design] Framing"
  post: "<p>In the chapter on proportions I already said that the proportions of the paper or material you're using, the so-called <em>frame</em> of the design, plays an important role as well. This chapter looks at that specific frame, but also at another powerful type of framing; within the design itself.</p>

<h2>What is a Frame?</h2>

<p>Framing an element is a way to emphasize or deemphasize it. When emphasizing, a frame makes its contents stand apart from its surroundings. This can be done in numerous ways, such as putting a visible border around it, or using contrast and tension between the element and its surrounding elements (by, for example, leaving a lot or very little space around the element).</p>

<p>When deemphasizing, the frame is subtle and makes its contents blend in with the rest of the design. This, again, can be done in numerous ways, such as removing any border or leaving a regular amount of white space around the element.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignFramingEmphasis.png" /></p>

<p>Either way, every element has a frame, and what you decide to do with it is perhaps the most important factor in determining how much attention the element gets. A strong frame around an element makes it clear for the viewer this is where their attention should be. In turn, this means you shouldn't use too many strong frames, or the design becomes convoluted and chaotic. On the other hand, no frames at all---more often than not---create an unclear hierarchy.</p>

<h2>Common Frames</h2>

<p>In most designs, at least some of the following frames are present:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Cropping: </strong>Essentially, cropping is the process of cutting an image or design into different and smaller proportions. By cutting off some of the original image, you can close in on detail and create interesting negative space. It can also suggest motion.</li>
	<li><strong>Margins: </strong>The margin is the area of white space between the edge of a paper and its contents. A wide margin places attention on the whole content, a narrow margin can make it seem like the content is bigger than it actually is; like it's bursting its seams. Margins also provide space for extra small and informational elements.</li>
	<li><strong>Bleeds: </strong>We say an image or design bleeds when it runs off the edges of the page. A bleeding image makes it seem like it's bigger and closer to you than it actually is, but it also creates lots of asymmetry and removes space for other elements.</li>
	<li><strong>Image &amp; Text: </strong>Images and text have such a complicated texture that they are often framed to make them clearly stand apart from their surroundings as one individual object. Additionally, putting text on top of an image poses a challenge, and the best way to solve it is putting a box around the text or reducing the contrast within the image.</li>
	<li><strong>Border:</strong> An actual, visible border can be put around elements. Borders define elements that lack an obvious edge, and can strongly emphasize anything. Borders are nothing more than lines, although some are simple and subtle lines, and some are complex and also meant as decorative elements. Sharp borders set elements apart, while soft borders let them blend in.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignFramingTypes.png" /></p>

<h2>Natural Frames</h2>

<p>Lots of elements and types of design have a natural, inherit frame that neither strongly emphasizes or deemphasizes an element---it's just a neutral frame.</p>

<p>For example, the edges of a simple, white piece of paper are natural frames. Putting a border against those edges often makes a design feel small, constrained and contained---it's like we're looking at the design through a small window. Similarly, basic elements such as lines, squares, and circles have their own simple contour that is easily recognizable and automatically frames them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, works of art are often framed within very obvious and explicit frames, in order to set them off from its surroundings or background. Because paintings are often displayed together with lots of other paintings, and hung upon a wall of certain colour, it needs to have a frame to make clear where it starts and ends.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignFramingContext.png" /></p>

<p>Be aware of the surroundings of an element or complete design, and also be aware of an element's natural borders. Framing small things makes them stand out, while framing large things can actually make them feel smaller and more contained. This is not only true in two-dimensional design; if you were to put a wall in front of a design, with a window in it through which you could view the whole design, it would still feel a lot smaller, even though you can see everything you'd see without the wall in front of it.</p>

<p>A frame can be a merely functional, as well as aesthetic element within a composition. Use framing well, and know that every element inherently has a frame---it's your job to emphasize or deemphasize it.</p>

  title: "[Design] Abstraction"
  post: "<p>A big part of design is abstracting the infinitely complex real world, and trying to capture the good parts on paper or within a small product. Most elements within a design represent something bigger and more advanced that people are familiar with, and it's your job as a designer to make this relationship obvious and quick to make. The most prominent example of this is of course the <em>icon</em> or <em>symbol</em>; a simple picture that should represent something, whether viewed at small or large sizes. But there are many other cases you will have to find a way to simplify something into an understandable graphical element, yet still allow people to see or feel the relationship.</p>

<h2>Levels of Abstraction</h2>

<p>Everything in a design is abstracted in some way, but the degree to which this happens differs. In other words, an element's (and design's) level of abstraction ranges from low to high. A low level of abstraction means a very objective but also full and overwhelming design, while a high level of abstraction means a very subjective but also simple and memorable design.</p>

<p>At the lowest level of abstraction is the photographic image. It captures something exactly as it is in real life, in all its complexity and diversity. Displaying an image is very objective, as you haven't removed things from the picture, or turned the objects into symbols.</p>

<p>At a medium level of abstraction is recognizable form based on reality, expressed using signs and symbols. Letters, numbers, and words are in this level, as they are something we as a society have made up, and agreed to possess a certain meaning.</p>

<p>At the highest level of abstraction are (some) pictograms and icons. They don't need to bear any resemblance to actual things, and are usually made up by the designer and subsequently linked with a certain word, principle, or action.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignAbstractionLevels.png" /></p>

<p>By deconstructing your message into a lot of abstract entities you increase the likelihood that people will like, remember and recognize your design. Nevertheless, it also reduces realism and increases subjectivity, as you decide completely what to include and how to display it to your audience. Abstracted designs have a greater chance to be liked by some, yet hated by others, based on preference. Abstraction helps express opinions and things other than information, but make sure your design doesn't turn too much into a piece of art.</p>

<h2>Icons and Symbols</h2>

<p>Within the realm of icons and symbols, there's also some distinctions to be made. It's highly recommended to learn to create good icons and use them everywhere you can, in two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional design. For example, everybody knows how to find the <em>off-button</em> on any device, based on an extremely simple made up icon created out of two lines.</p>

<p>We identify four types of iconic representation:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Similar: </strong>Visually identical or highly similar to an action, object, or concept. Most effective for simple actions or concepts, less effective when complexity increases.</li>
	<li><strong>Example: </strong>Uses images of things that exemplify or are commonly associated with an action, object, or concept. Particularly effective for complex matters.</li>
	<li><strong>Symbolic: </strong>Uses images that represent an action, concept, or object at a higher level of abstraction. Effective when things involve well-established and easily recognizable objects.</li>
	<li><strong>Arbitrary: </strong>Uses images that bear little resemblance---the relationship has to be learned by the user. Should only be used when developing unique new cross-platform, cross-cultural or industry standards that will be used for long periods of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, icons should be labelled at one point within the design (at least), and share the same visual motif.</p>

  title: "[Design] Composition"
  post: "<p>In case you haven't noticed, we've been moving from the smallest possible pieces towards the biggest throughout this course. We start with basic elements (point, line, shape), then continued with principles applicable to lots of elements and the whole design, and now we're at the chapter that's about everything design is: <em>composition</em>. Good graphic design is about creating an interesting and informational composition. This means that you already know quite a lot about how to do that, and this chapter might seem unnecessary, but I wanted to use it to show specific uses and applications of everything you've learned. This should help you jumpstart your designs and give a better understanding of everything you've seen.</p>

<h2>What Exactly is Composition?</h2>

<p>Composition is everything, literally. Composition is <em>which</em> elements you place within a design, and <em>how</em> you place them; it's the total package. It's about how elements are arranged throughout the design, but also about which elements to choose and which not. On top of everything you've already learned, I want to leave you with three tips: how to <em>avoid unintended visual illusions</em>, how to create an <em>overall interesting design</em>, and <em>common composition types</em>.</p>

<h2>Avoid Unintentional Visual Illusions</h2>

<p>One thing you definitely want to avoid, is using a framing that creates unwanted visual illusions. These so-called <strong>tangents</strong> occur when picture elements just touch, but do not overlap. This can create bizarre illustrations where things seem to be connected or on top of each other, while they are actually far away from each other.</p>

<p>Additionally, avoid cutting off objects at small or narrow places. If somebody's hand is cropped out of the picture, you'll only see a person's arm and think the poor soul has lost his hand. If you frame the picture in such a way that, for example, also part of the arm is cropped out, it won't seem to be that way.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignCompositionTangents.png" /></p>

<h2>Use Interesting Contrasts</h2>

<p>By embracing opposing ideas in a single picture, you can establish creative tension. A few ideas are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Repetition and Variation</li>
	<li>Simplicity and Complexity</li>
	<li>Clarity and Ambiguity</li>
	<li>Balance and Imbalance</li>
	<li>Brightness and Darkness</li>
	<li>Sharpness and Softness</li>
	<li>Active and Passive (Shapes)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/DesignCompositionStraddles.png" /></p>

<h2>Common Compositions</h2>

<p>To finish off this chapter, and ultimately the whole course, I want to leave you with five ideas for your next composition. As I said before, these are just guidelines, and there's no specific right or wrong here.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Centre Biased</strong>: The centre is the focal point. Pieces around it direct focus towards the centre by (invisible) perspective lines.</li>
	<li><strong>Background, Midground, Foreground</strong>: These three levels of distance complement each other.</li>
	<li><strong>Focal Point---Contrast</strong>: Create an (artificial) focus point by heavily contrasting it with the rest of the drawing.</li>
	<li><strong>Focal Point---"Camera" Blur</strong>: Blur everything you don't want the focus to be on. On the computer it's easy, in real life you'll need to work with gradients and smudging.</li>
	<li><strong>Using Asymmetry</strong>: Rotating stuff, displacing them, using non-symmetric shapes---all sorts of things that can create a sense of discomfort, danger, or exciting/thrilling things happening in the drawing.</li>
	<li><strong>Rule of Odds:</strong> Create a focal point by framing an element with an even number of surrounding elements. The odd number of elements makes it interesting and asymmetric, while the even number of background elements create symmetry.</li>
	<li><strong>Rule of Space: </strong>By leaving white space in a certain direction, you encourage the viewer's eye to move in that direction, implying motion towards a focal point.</li>
</ul>

  title: "[Design] The Design Process"
  post: "<p>In this course we have, thus far, only intensively discussed one topic at a time. The only questions remaining now read: <em>where do I start? What steps do I take and in what order?</em></p>

<p>Well, this is essentially completely up to you, and it depends on the project what is easiest to start with, and whether certain stages of the process overlap. There are, however, some general steps that need to be taken, that are commonly pursued (in the same fixed order).</p>

<p>These steps are: <em>brainstorm</em>, <em>create hierarchy</em>, <em>formstorm</em>, <em>prototype, apply principles</em>,<em> finish</em>.</p>

<p><img src="media/DesignProcess.png" /></p>

<h2>Brainstorm</h2>

<p>In this stage you research the topic, collect all information and determine your message and minimal requirements. For example, say you need to design a poster to recommend a certain new product that helps you write a book. Then the first thing you do is research everything that has to do with books and stories, to find visual symbols that people relate to good stories or perhaps to find what people struggle with the most when they try to write their own book.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when you've collected lots of data, you look at the requirements your client (implicitly) gives you. Perhaps they want certain colours to be used, or they have certain graphic elements all over their website they want to bring back, or they only want posters in a certain paper format.</p>

<h2>Create Hierarchy</h2>

<p>When you have everything you want to tell your audience, you need to structure it. You'll need to divide it into groups and determine levels of importance. The most important thing to get right is of course the focus point; once you've established it, you can create a hierarchy of all other elements simply by checking their (subordinate) relationship to the focus point. How you're going to visually display that hierarchy is not of importance at this step; you've learned numerous ways to do so, and they can all be applied.</p>

<h2>Formstorm</h2>

<p>With your information structured, you're ready to start thinking about visual forms. This can be done from two different points of view.</p>

<p>Firstly, you could look at all techniques you know for grouping and establishing hierarchy, and try them out one by one. Just go through all of them and apply them the best way you can with the data and restrictions you have. Don't be judgmental now---try a lot, even when you think you got it or you think something will never work out.</p>

<p>Secondly, you could forget those principles and think out of the box. Search for visuals related to what you're doing and see if you find out why they work so well, or if you can copy some parts of them in your design. Research action verbs related to your topic and data, and try to find visual elements solely based on that verb.</p>

<h2>Prototype</h2>

<p>Once you've established a basic idea of what forms and shapes you want, and how you want to create the composition, you can put it all together and start prototyping. This simply means that you take all your ideas, and see if you can put them together, and perhaps change some things here and there to fit all elements. An idea can seem awesome on its own, but it's all the elements together that will have to make up the final design. This means it's okay to change an original idea or remove elements completely, <em>if</em> they really don't do your design any good.</p>

<p>This process should actually be executed at the same time as the next stage; they are intertwined, and go hand in hand.</p>

<h2>Apply Principles</h2>

<p>Apply the principles you've learned, and let them decide optimal placement and properties for an element. Especially adhering to strong alignment, repetition and contrast will give you good starting points for creating the final composition.</p>

<p>NOTE: Remember, if everything is big and bold, nothing is big and bold! Apply the principles, but take a step back and do some prototyping before it goes out of hand.</p>

<h2>Finish</h2>

<p>Once you have a prototype, it's time to refine it into one final design. If you have multiple prototypes, you'll have to choose between them before starting with this stage---adding finishing touches to all of them won't help your decision and will take lots of time.</p>

<p>These finishing touches can be anything; small changes in placement or size, addition of extra (explanatory) text, subtle changes in colour, removing or adding one or two small elements. Especially important is that you revisit the design multiple times after taking a break for at least a day, and also try to look at it from different positions and angles. When you're caught up in designing something, you often forget that everybody else won't look at it and feel about it the same way as you, the creator, do.</p>

<p>If you have to make large decisions now, you've messed up in some earlier stage and should go back to the beginning.</p>

  title: "[Design] Conclusion: what now?"
  post: "<p>I don't think any more can be said about graphic design, in general. From this point, you should do two things; start designing and practicing with the tools I gave you, and look at specializations. The first one helps these tools become second nature to you, while the second will give you advanced, specific design knowledge. For example, you could look further into logo design, or learn absolutely everything there is to know about typography, or the colour red, if you want to be that specialized.</p>

<p>If you're ever stuck, here are some design exercises to do:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Restricted Library:</strong> Set yourself some strong and some subtle restrictions, such as a fixed grid or limited colour palette, and see what you can do with them. Simply take a piece of text or an illustration, and make an awesome design out of it, within the restrictions you set yourself.</li>
	<li><strong>Dailies: </strong>Create a simple design every day, for a relatively long period of time. Start with a simple idea, such as "keep a journal" and design the text you write (or things you draw). Then, every subsequent day, change the parameters or restrictions a little, and create another simple design. These should not be time consuming---instead, they will teach you how to design something unique very quickly, even when your inspiration well is dry.</li>
	<li><strong>Persona Portraits: </strong>Develop a fictitious persona, however complex you want it to be. A name, appearance, and character traits should do. Then, design something about that character, through the lens of the character. For example, the person could be very scared of squirrels---use your knowledge of line and shape and design principles to show this fear.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I said at the start of the course, there's another large part of design: <em>usability</em> or sometimes called <em>user experience</em>. This course has only been about graphical design, which is only one (small) part of designing anything. I recommend you follow the <strong><em>usability</em> </strong>course as well, to get the full picture and understand more about what lies at the basis of any good design.</p>

<p>I hope to have been of service to you, and keep designing!</p>

  title: "The Complete PHP Guide"
  post: "<p>PHP never expected to become this big, but nowadays the language is present in nearly every top 10 list of programming languages. Anybody who wants to create dynamic websites (or <em>web apps</em>) will at some point require some of PHP's magic. After you've learned the ins and outs of HTML and CSS, and perhaps JavaScript, it's usually time to learn about PHP. Fortunately, the language is easy to learn.</p>

<p>Whereas HTML stood for HyperText Markup Language, <strong>PHP</strong> is a recursive acronym for <em>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</em>. As the name suggests, it is executed before the HTML is loaded---it pre-processes the HTML.</p>

<p>This means that it's executed on the <em>server</em>, and not within the user's browser. Such a language is called a <em>server-side language</em>, and has the obvious advantage that it can interact with data on the server. The typical use case for PHP is, therefore, to load data from a server, or upload data to it. This data can be blog posts, files, user login information, comments---anything you want.</p>

<img src="media/PHPOverview.png" />

<p>However simple or complex, however large or small, PHP will probably be able to do the job for you. This guide will teach you the core fundamentals of the language in a way that's as general as possible, so that you can apply it to anything, not just specific examples. Nevertheless, PHP can't do it all on its own, and you'll probably need to learn about <em>SQL</em> as well at some point. This is not a bad thing; SQL is another language that is crucial to the world wide web, and it helps a lot if you can use it.</p>

<p>Ultimately, when you've become all excited and want to know more, you can keep reading and move towards the <strong><em>Advanced PHP Tutorial</em></strong>. It's up to you how far you take it. (But I hope you take it very far; the more you know, the better and more secure your code.) Either way, have fun!</p>

  title: "[PHP] Installation"
  post: "<p>Computers don't automatically come with code that runs PHP, as computers aren't servers. Therefore, to test your PHP, you can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use a free or paid hosting plan that has PHP installed, where you host your website on their servers. Almost all hosting has PHP pre-installed, so no need for you to worry about it.</li>
	<li>Turn your own computer into a small server-like environment. This can be done by downloading and installing a small piece of software, or by doing a manual installation yourself. Fortunately, PHP is completely free.</li>
</ul>

<p>I myself, for example, use both. I host this website on a server so that you can all access it, but when I write and test new code I use software to host the website on my own computer. Not only is this kind of local testing quicker, it's also cheaper and reduces the load on my website's server.</p>

<p>If you're just a novice at PHP, doing a manual installation is unnecessarily complicated, which is why I recommend using software. (On the other hand, if you're already a PHP wizard, manual installation have some advantages for you. For information about that, visit the official <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/install.php">PHP Install Manual</a></p>

<h2>Using Software</h2>

<p>The most popular software, which is also available on all three platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux), is <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">XAMPP</a></p>

<p>Once you've downloaded it, install it. There's no harm in installing all components, but you only really need <em>Apache</em>, <em>PHP</em> and <em>MySQL</em> for this course. The default path (<code>C:\\xampp</code>) is fine.</p>

<h2>How do I start/stop the Server?</h2>

<p>Once installed, you can find the software like any other on your system, and fire it up. The interface might be intimidating, but to <strong>start the server</strong>, simply click <em>Start</em> on the Apache module. Similarly, to <strong>stop the server</strong>, click <em>Stop</em>.</p>

<h2>Where do I place my files?</h2>

<p>By default, the software will create the folder <code>C:\\xampp\\htdocs</code>. This is where you should place all the files from your website, or at least all the files you want to test. You can simply remember it by the fact that <em>htdocs</em> stands for <em>html documents</em>.</p>

<h2>How do I view my files?</h2>

<p>Just like every other website, you can visit the website on your own server by typing a URL in the browser bar. Because it's a local server that nobody else has access to, you can do so by typing <code>localhost</code> or <code>127.0.0.1</code></p>

<p>Visit it, and you should see a welcome message from XAMPP, which means it was successfully installed. If you see an error, installation was unsuccessful, or the service is not running.</p>

<h2>Let's do a Quick Test</h2>

<p>To test if PHP is actually working, let's quickly create our first PHP file. PHP files are essentially no different from HTML, CSS or JavaScript files---you can create and edit them with any text editor of your choice. The only difference is that PHP files---not surprisingly---carry the extension <code>.php</code>.</p>

<p>So, fire up your favourite text editor, or the default editor on your operating system (which is probably <em>Notepad</em> for Windows, and <em>Text Editor</em> for Mac). Create a new file, and type</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
<?php
	echo "Hello World!";
?>
</pre>

<p>What does this mean? It simply starts a PHP block, and prints the phrase <em>Hello World!</em> to the page. Save the file as <code>test.php</code>, and to check if everything works as expected, access it by visiting <code>localhost/test.php</code>.</p>

<p>If it does, congratulations! You've written your first bit of PHP, and you even have a local test environment working perfectly.</p>

<p>If it doesn't, there's a good chance you accidentally unchecked PHP on installation. If you made any type error, XAMPP will automatically throw an error message to let you know what went wrong so you can fix it. Or, you might have forgotten to place the file in the right directory.</p>

  title: "[PHP] Syntax"
  post: "<p>Like any proper programming language, PHP has a fundamental syntax that is at the basis of <em>everything</em>. This chapter will tell you all about it.</p>

<h2>Integration with HTML</h2>

<p>As you saw in last chapter, PHP files are simple text files that don't need to be compiled. You can simply write some code within the file, and load it up in the browser to see how it works. This is great, because it allows us to very quickly make changes and update our website. But, websites are always created out of HTML, CSS and JavaScript---what role does PHP play?</p>

<p>Well, it pre-processes the file, which means it inserts HTML into the file <em>before</em> it is being sent back to the browser, and rendered. This means that you could let PHP perform something like <code>echo "<h1>A Heading!</h1>"</code>, and suddenly you have an extra heading on the page.</p>

<p>Even better: it doesn't stop there. You can let PHP decide whether a certain part of an HTML page is displayed, you can use it to add or remove CSS rules from a page based on certain conditions, you can use it to dynamically add JavaScript code---anything is possible!</p>

<h2>The PHP Block</h2>

<p>For the browser to know when we're typing PHP code, and when we're using regular HTML, we need a clear and concise way to tell the browser when a block of PHP code starts and ends. For this, we have the PHP opening and closing tag:</p>

<code class="longsyntax"><?php
  <em>any php code here</em>
?></code>

<p>This means that a file with the extension <code>.php</code>, is simply a regular <strong>.html</strong> file but with the added possibility of using PHP blocks. This also means that we can do crazy things with the page using only PHP, such as remove certain parts entirely, as the next example will illustrate.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
<?php
  //Because 2 is not equal to 5, the following HTML will not display
  if(2 === 5) {
?>
<p>This is a nice paragraph!</p>

<?php 
  //Instead, PHP will insert this heading into the page
  } else {
    echo "<h1>BUT THIS IS A HEADING!</h1>";
  }
?>
</pre>

<h2>Statements &amp; Blocks</h2>

<p>Anything you write, will either be a <strong>statement</strong> or a <strong>block</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>A <em>statement</em> is a line of code that is to be carried out by the server. These include things such as printing a certain line, or performing some math.</li>
	<li>A <em>block</em> is a set of statements with lines of code that open and close the block. These include things such as blocks that should be repeated several times, or blocks that should only be executed if a certain condition is true.</li>
</ul>

<p>A statement always uses the following general syntax. Note the semicolon that closes off the statement.</p>

<code class="longsyntax">somestatement;</code>

<p>A block always uses this general syntax.</p>

<code class="longsyntax">someblockopening {
  lots of statements
}</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
//BLOCK: If a user is logged in
if($userIsLoggedIn) {
	//STATEMENT: Display a welcome message
	echo "Welcome, " . $username;
}
</pre>

<p>NOTE: You <em>could</em> leave out the last closing tag or semicolon of a PHP code block, because it will automatically be interpreted as the end of the last statement. But, it's bad practice, and I advise against it.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Just like HTML (and CSS, and JavaScript), PHP has the possibility of adding comments within the file. These comments are not executed or parsed by the server, and are merely there for you to remind yourself why you did something or how some part of your code works. As always, the syntax for comments is the only thing in the language that is distinct from the statement or block syntax.</p>

<p>To create comments that span a <em>single line</em>, use one of the following two syntaxes</p>

<code class="longsyntax">// this is a comment
# this is a comment</code>

<p>To create comments that span <em>multiple lines</em>, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">/* this
   is
   a
   comment */</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
/* LONG EXPLANATION:
 * The following code does blabla 
 * and some more blabla
 * and finally returns blablabla
 */

//This is a quick remark, and therefore a single-line comment
</pre>

<p>NOTE: PHP discards HTML comments. So, if you created an HTML comment with the regular <code><-- --></code> syntax, and placed a PHP block inside it, it would still execute.</p>

  title: "[PHP] A Powerful Echo"
  post: "<p>Because PHP runs on a server, you can't easily check what it's doing from the browser or developer tools. Therefore, when working with PHP, there will be lots of times when your code could execute perfectly fine, but you wouldn't know---and, times when your code is completely wrong, but it doesn't throw any errors.</p>

<p>To see what's going on, and to directly insert the results of your PHP code into an HTML page, we have two methods: <strong>echo</strong> and <strong>print</strong>.</p>

<h2>Echo</h2>

<p>You've already seen the syntax for echo statements, which is simply</p>

<code class="longsyntax">echo expression, &hellip;, expression;</code>

<p>As you can see, you can choose to echo only one thing, or a multitude of things (as long as they are separated by commas). These expressions can be anything---that's what the rest of this course is all about.</p>

<p>If you're only echo-ing one expression, you can use the alternative <em>parenthesis syntax</em>:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">echo(expression);</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
echo "<p>This is a paragraph that has been dynamically inserted by PHP. How great!</p>";
</pre>

<h2>Print</h2>

<p>The print statement does the same as echo statements, but with these differences:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It only accepts a single expression.</li>
	<li>It's marginally slower than <strong>echo</strong>.</li>
	<li>It returns the value <strong>1</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, it has two equivalent syntaxes:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">print(expression);
print expression;</code>

<p>The fact that this function returns value one, simply means that the result of using it is an expression itself (unlike echo statements). This means that you can chain multiple <code>print</code> statements, or use them within any complex structure, whilst the <code>echo</code> keyword can only be at the start of a line.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
print 5*5*5;  //Displays 5*5*5 = 125 on the page
print(5*5*5); //Does exactly the same.
</pre>

<h2>Why Two Syntaxes?</h2>

<p>Because both of these methods are fundamental and crucial to the PHP language. Without them, you wouldn't be able to do anything (and that's no exaggeration). Almost all other functions in PHP, no matter how many parameters they accept, require the parentheses.</p>

<p>To differentiate between those different kinds of functions, we call fundamental functions with those two syntaxes <strong>language constructs</strong>. Language constructs are more than functions; they are the building blocks of the language.</p>

<h2>Functions? Parameters? What?</h2>

<p>As you can see, <em>functions</em> play a large role in any programming language. Functions are nothing more than blocks (consisting of lots of statements) with a name, so that you can call it from anywhere within the program.</p>

<p>Nearly every statement you will write, will be a call to some function. Lots of these functions are built-in, and allow you to do crucial things such as get the length of a piece of text, connect to a database, or perform complex math operations. (You can also create functions yourself.)</p>

<p>But, those functions usually require some values to work---values which you must provide. For example, to get the length of a piece of text, we need to know which piece of text we want the function to work on. The values a function accepts are called <em>parameters</em>. The actual values you give it in a certain instance are called <em>arguments</em>. When a function gives you back a value, such as the length of a piece of text, we say that it <em>returns</em> that value.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
echo strlen("PANDA");
/* The word above, strlen(), is a function that determines the length of a piece of text
 * It accepts one parameter, which is the piece of text we want to examine
 * In this case, we give it the argument "PANDA"
 * Then, it returns the length of the word "PANDA", which is 5.
 * This value, 5, is displayed in the browser by echo
*/
</pre>

<p>Don't worry, functions and the like will be discussed in great detail later in the course, I just wanted to get some terminology out of the way.</p>

  title: "[PHP] Data Types"
  post: "<p>When programming, everything you do is simply <em>doing stuff with data</em>. This might sound scary, but hear me out. The purpose of any program is to present information to the user, or upload information from the user to the server. You could, for example, calculate the costs of buying everything inside a shopping cart, or dynamically create an HTML navigation from pieces of data, or load all the text from a blog post.</p>

<p>Therefore, everything your script will work with has to be data of some kind, which is why PHP has several basic <em>data types</em>. The eight types I will discuss here are called <strong>primitives</strong>.</p>

<p>Within the primitives category, there's another distinction made between <em>scalar types</em>, <em>compound types</em> and <em>special types</em>.</p>

<h2>Scalar Types</h2>

<p>Scalar types contain data with only one value; they are the fundamental building blocks of the programming language. There's nothing smaller than this.</p>

<h3>Integer</h3>

<p>An integer is a whole number (positive or negative). It can be entered just like you'd expect: by typing the actual number. Alternatively, you can enter the number in <em>hexadecimal</em>, <em>octal</em>, or <em>binary</em> format.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
1234; // Decimal number
-123; // Negative number
0123; // Octal number 
0x1A; // Hexadecimal number 
0b11111111; // Binary number 
</pre>

<p>Of course, integers can't get infinitely large, so there's a maximum value. This is platform-dependant, but usually around two billion. Once you go beyond that, PHP will convert the value to a float.</p>

<h3>Float</h3>

<p>A floating point number (or <em>double</em>) is any real number, including integers, but also fractions and anything else you can imagine. There are two ways to write them; the <em>regular notation</em> (with the decimal point), and <em>scientific notation</em>.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
1.234; //Regular floating point
1.2e3; //Scientific notation for 1200
7E-2;  //Scientific notation for 0.07 
</pre>

<p>Floating numbers have a maximum as well, which lies around <code>1.8e308</code> (which is a very, very big number).</p>

<p>Also keep in mind, that computers work with a base 2 system, which means that numbers that look nice in our base 10 system (such as <strong>0.1</strong> or <strong>0.55</strong>), will have very tiny rounding errors when you start working with them. Usually, this won't be a problem, as long as you never exactly compare two floating numbers.</p>

<h3>Boolean</h3>

<p>A Boolean is the simplest type of them all. It has only two values: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Both are case-insensitive. You can use it like an on-off switch; if a certain condition is true, execute this piece of code, if it's false instead, execute this other piece.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
true
false
</pre>

<h3>String</h3>

<p>A string is a sequence of characters, usually used for pieces of text. Strings can get as large as more than two billion characters. There are four ways to create a string: <em>single quotes</em>, <em>double quotes</em>, <em>heredoc</em> and <em>nowdoc</em>.</p>

<h4>Single Quotes vs Double Quotes</h4>

<p>Placing a piece of text between single (<code>' '</code>) or double (<code>" "</code>) quotes turns it into a string. Don't mix them up, though, or you will meet many errors.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
'This is a cool string';
"This is a cool string as well";

"This is a cool string';
//ERROR, single quotes can't close off double quotes
</pre>

<h4>Heredoc vs Nowdoc</h4>

<p>For very long pieces of text, spanning multiple lines, the other two syntaxes come in handy. Instead of quotes, you can choose the delimiters yourself!</p>

<p>The heredoc syntax looks like this</p>

<code class="longsyntax"><<<DELIMITER
some
long
string
DELIMITER;
</code>

<p>The nowdoc syntax like this</p>

<code class="longsyntax"><<<'DELIMITER'
some
long
string
DELIMITER;
</code>

<p>The difference is that the second syntax does <em>not</em> parse the string. If you were to add variables or expressions within the string (which you'll learn about soon), they would not be parsed, but simply displayed as text instead.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$panda = 'be';

<<<PANDA
To
be
or
not
to
$panda
PANDA;
//Prints: To be or not to be

<<<'PANDA'
To
be
or
not
to
$panda
PANDA;
//Prints: To be or not to $panda
</pre>

<p>NOTE: It's very important that the <em>heredoc</em> and <em>nowdoc</em> closing delimiter does <strong>not</strong> have any other characters on its line---not even spaces or indentation.</p>

<h2>Compound Types</h2>

<p>Compound types are essentially a collection of scalar types. I'll explain these more in-depth in their respective chapters.</p>

<h3>Array</h3>

<p>An array is a list of values (of different data types). You could, for example, store all the pages a user has visited as strings in an array.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$grocery_list = ["Bread", "Milk", "Sugar", "Honey", "Cornflakes", "Bicycle", "iPad", "Ferrari"];
</pre>

<h3>Object</h3>

<p>An object is an expansion on the array. Instead of only containing values, it can also have functions you can execute. Whereas an array is just a list, an object is used for things that actually represent objects. For example, you could create a single new object for every item a user has in his/her shopping cart, and let that object hold all the information about that item.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//This is just to give you a general idea, you don't need to understand it now
$new_user = new User(); //Create a new user object
$new_user->log_in();    //Call a function on the object
</pre>

<h2>Special Types</h2>

<p>Special types are, well, special exceptions.</p>

<h3>NULL</h3>

<p>Sometimes you're going to work with data that doesn't have a determined data type (yet), or data that has been removed. For these cases, we say the data is of type null. The only value for this data type, is <code>null</code>. (Which is case-insensitive, just as with Booleans.)</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
null;
</pre>

<h3>Resource</h3>

<p>A resource is a reference to an external resource. They can only be created by a small list of special functions. Because there's a <em>huge</em> amount of different resources you could access and work with in PHP, I won't mention them all in this course. I will discuss only the most important ones: functions that access a database to get some data from it, or upload data to it.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//For example, the following code connects to a database and returns a resource
mysqli_connect("localhost", "my_user", "my_password", "my_db");

  title: "[PHP] Variables I"
  post: "<p>Alright, so we've seen all the types of data PHP can handle. But, computers can't just have data flying around---it needs to be (temporarily) saved somewhere, under a certain name. More importantly, by saving data under a name, we can find it and use it at other places in the code, together with other data. For this, we have <em>variables</em>.</p>

> A variable is a container for storing data

<p>For example, we could perform a complex calculation, and then put the result inside a variable named "result". And then, at some other point in the program, we could use this result again (in another calculation or statement) by calling it by its name. Variables are <em>super-duper useful</em>, and you'll be working with them a lot, which is why I will devote two chapters to them.</p>

<h2>Defining Variables</h2>

<p>In PHP, variables aren't necessarily created. A variable exists from the moment you assign a value to it. To define a variable, we use the <em>dollar syntax</em> (<strong>$</strong>) and <em>assignment operator</em> (<strong>=</strong>):</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$some_variable_name = value;</code>

<p>This means that, unlike some other programming languages, a variable's data type is not fixed. Any time you want, you can assign a new value to a variable (using the same syntax), even if that value is of completely different data type. Yes, PHP is that flexible.</p>

<h2>Using Variables</h2>

<p>To use a variable---which means accessing its value---simply call it by its name. And, don't forget to put the dollar sign in front.</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$some_variable_name</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
$save_result = 5*5*5;
echo $save_result; //Prints 125 in the browser

$username = "Juan";
echo "Welcome, " . $username; //Prints: Welcome, Juan
</pre>

<p>NOTE: If you haven't assigned a value to the variable you're calling, the value will be <code>null</code>. You will also probably get a notice or warning by PHP that the variable is undefined.</p>

<h2>Naming Variables</h2>

<p>Now, I might have given the impression that you could name variables any way you like, but that's not true. Some rules have been established to make sure PHP reads the code correctly as a variable (and not as a number, or string, or anything else). A variable name</p>

<ul>
	<li>Must start with a letter (lowercase or uppercase) or underscore ( <strong>_</strong> )</li>
	<li>May never start with a number</li>
	<li>Can only contain alpha-numeric characters (that is, letters and figures) and underscores</li>
</ul>

<p>It's good practice to use descriptive names for your variables. It's better to use long variable names that describe exactly what data they hold, instead of short and indecipherable names.</p>

<p>Additionally, PHP variables are usually written in <strong>snake_case</strong>. This means that you only use lowercase characters, and that you separate words by underscores. <em>Why?</em> Because all of PHP's built-in functionality also follows this syntax. (For example, the function <code>is_string(<em>par</em>)</code> checks if its parameter has data type string.)</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//This will give an error
$3tips = "1) Never buy a snake. 2) Don't burn down your home 3) Don't go to bed without your teddy bear";

//This is fine
$tips = "...";
$_3tips = "...";
$tips_for_you = "...";
</pre>

<h2>References</h2>

<p>In case you hadn't figured it out already, we can assign any value to a variable, so we can also assign the value from another variable! For example, if you create variable <code>$A</code> that holds a string, you could say <code>$B = $A</code>, and now variable <code>$B</code> has the exact same string as value.</p>

<p>When you do this, PHP copies the value from one variable to another. With large values, though, this can add a huge amount of extra load for the server. This can be solved with <strong>references</strong>.</p>

<p>A reference simply points two variables at each other. They take on the same value, and if one of them changes, the other changes with it. A reference is created by putting an <em>ampersand</em> ( <code>&amp;</code> ) in front of the variable value:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$somevar = &amp;$othervar;</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
$some_value = true;
$other_value = &$some_value;

$other_value = false;
//Now both $some_value and $other_value are false.
</pre>

<h2>Dynamic Variables</h2>

<p>PHP has even more variable magic in store for us. Not only can we change the value of a variable, we can also change the variable name (and keep the value)! Variables like this are, quite logically, called <strong>variable variables</strong>.</p>

<p><em>How does PHP know we want it to use the other variable's value, instead of the other variable's name?</em> Well, we can force PHP to evaluate an expression by placing it between curly braces ( <code>{ }</code> ). In doing so, the syntax for creating variable variables becomes</p>

<code class="longsyntax">${$someothervar}= value;</code>

<p>This isn't restricted to other variables; we could place whole computations between those curly braces to be used as the variable name. If you know you're only going to reference a variable, however, you can use the following shorthand syntax:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$$someothervar = value;</code>

<p>This isn't even restricted to two dollar signs; you can place as many dollar signs after each other as you want, each referencing another variable (as illustrated in the example). Endless possibilities!</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$a = "panda";
$panda = "awesome";
$awesome = "LEGO!";

echo $$$a; //Prints LEGO!

$panda1 = "awesome";
$panda2 = "awesomer";
$panda3 = "awesomest";

echo ${"panda" . (6/2)}; //Prints awesomest 
</pre>

<h2>Case Sensitivity</h2>

<p>When I discussed the data types, I mentioned for several types that case doesn't matter. <code>TRUE</code>, <code>True</code> and <code>true</code> are all the same thing. This is true as well for all other built-in PHP functionality (although it's highly recommended to stick to the <em>snake case</em>).</p>

<p>This is <strong>not</strong> true, however, for variables. If you declare a variable, you can only reference it by typing the exact same name. Thus, for example, <code>$somevar</code> and <code>$someVar</code> are not the same. Lots of errors are the result of people carelessly changing the case of their variables---don't be that person, stick to the same syntax!</p>

<p>NOTE: Any other user-defined things you'll learn about later, such as classes, are also case sensitive.</p>

<h2>Deleting Variables</h2>

<p>Last but not least, how would you go about deleting a variable you don't need anymore? There are two ways, but you should use the first one:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Set a variable to value <code>null</code></li>
	<li>Call <code>unset($variable)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The second doesn't just set a variable to null again, it actually completely removes the variable from the program. Usually, this is a much heavier process to execute, and you don't really need it.</p>

<p>Once you use a variable that is not set, however, PHP will throw all sorts of errors and hell breaks loose. Therefore, in some cases where you're unsure, it's useful to check whether a variable is set or not. This is done with</p>

<code class="longsyntax">isset($var);</code>

<p>NOTE: When a variable is set to null, it's also set. A variable is only not set if it has no defined value.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//If the username is set, which it is in this case, welcome the user
$username = "Ginty";

if(isset($username)) {
	echo "Welcome, " . $username;
}

//Now we remove the variable, and the code will NOT welcome the user a second time
unset($username);

if(isset($username)) {
	echo "Welcome, " . $username;
}

  title: "[PHP] Variables II"
  post: "<p>Now that you know how to create any variable you can dream of, and assign it any value you can dream of, there's one huge problem left: <em>incompatible data types</em>. It's nice that we have all these different data types, but because they are different, we can't easily mix them together. How can you add an integer to a string? How can you divide a Boolean by a float? How can you compare an array of different values with another array of different values?</p>

<p>This chapter will talk about how PHP automatically converts data types to make them compatible, and what you can do to change or aid this process.</p>

<h2>Type Juggling</h2>

<p>PHP is a nice guy. When you give him several data of different type, he will try to convert them so they match together, and he won't even tell you the bother he went through. The result is that you can mindlessly mash together variables of differing data type without errors, but the results can be unexpected. This is called <em>type juggling</em>.</p>

<p>If you put together two types, they will both be converted to the data type with highest importance. The order of type importance is:</p>

> <em>Null => Boolean => String => Integer => Float</em>

<p>So, for example,</p>

<ul>
	<li>Executing <code>0.5 + 1</code> will result in a float of value <code>1.5</code>.</li>
	<li>Executing <code>3 + "7 dwarfs"</code> will result in an integer with value <code>10</code>.</li>
	<li>The integer value of <code>null</code>, <code>false</code> and <code>""</code> (empty string) is <code>0</code>.</li>
	<li>The integer value of <code>true</code> is <code>1</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What about arrays, objects and resources?</em> Well, because there's many different ways to combine two of them, there's no predefined behaviour. How do you add an array to an array? Add all values separately, or simply append the other array to the back? Putting together values of these data types will result in an error, unfortunately.</p>

<p>NOTE: Either way, remember that type juggling only converts a variable to a certain data type <em>in that specific expression</em>. The data type of the variable itself will remain untouched.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$variable_uno = 15;
$variable_duo = true; 

//Integer has highest importance, so true is converted to 1
//And the following statement will print 16
echo $variable_uno + $variable_duo;
</pre>

<h2>Type Casting</h2>

<p>There's two problems with type juggling: we have no control over how it converts the values, and the conversion isn't permanent. Luckily, we can force PHP to convert a variable to a certain type with <em>type casting</em>. Two alternative syntaxes exist:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$variable = (type) value;
settype($variable, "type");</code>

<p>They do exactly the same---you can use what you like best. These type keywords are available:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Keyword(s)</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>int</code>, <code>integer</code></p>

			</td>

			<p>Casts a string to binary string</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="php">
$username = "Ginty";

//The username has now become an integer with value 0
$username = (int) $username; 

//The username has now become a boolean with value false
settype($username, "bool");
</pre>

<h2>Debugging Variables</h2>

<p>Now, we're in a bit of a quandary here. If we were to <code>echo</code> a variable, we would see its converted value. With all this type juggling and wizarding, how could we ever know the type of a variable?</p>

<p>Well, to retrieve the type of a variable (as a string), use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">gettype($var);</code>

<p>Lots of times, however, you simply want to check if a variable is of a certain type. For example, if the user inputs a string, do this, but if not, do that. For this, we have a collection of so-called <em>is_type</em> functions, which returns true if a variable is indeed of type <em>type</em>, and false otherwise.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Function</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>is_int()</code></p>

		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>is_callable()</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Checks if variable is callable (which means it's a function---more on that later).</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="php">
$username = "Ginty";

echo gettype($username); //Prints "string"

$is_username_valid = is_string($username); //Returns true, so yes the username is valid!
</pre>

<h2>A Programmer's Echo</h2>

<p>But, there's one last problem here. (Last one, I promise.) Because it's impossible to convert an array or object, we can't even use <code>echo</code> to see its value. It would just give us an error. It would, therefore, be nice if we had some functions that would print our variables in a more readable, programmer-friendly way.</p>

<p>Fortunately, PHP has just the thing for you. To print any variable in a readable way, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">print_r($var)</code>

<p>If you want to take it one step further, and print all the information about a variable (type, contents, size, etcetera), use one of the following two</p>

<code class="longsyntax">var_dump($var);
var_export($var, true);</code>

<p>NOTE: The difference is that the second function outputs information about the variable as valid PHP code. So, you could save that information inside a new variable and do something with it if you want.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$player = "Ginty";
$items = ["Potion", "Sword", "Gun", "Smartphone"];
$player_has_a_sword = true;

var_dump($player); //Prints string(5) "Ginty"

//It also helps display variables that can't be converted to meaningful strings
var_dump($player_has_a_sword); //Prints bool(true)

print_r($items); 
/* Prints the array in readable format;
	Array
	(
    	  [0] => Potion
    	  [1] => Sword
    	  [2] => Gun
    	  [3] => Smartphone
	)
*/

  post: "<p>Now that we know how to create lots of different variables of lots of different types, it's time to actually start doing something with them. Computers are, at their core, number crunching machines, performing complex math the whole time. Math, however simple or complex, will always play a big part in your programs as well, which is we need an easy and quick way to perform those math operations. Not surprisingly, for this we can use <strong>operators</strong>.</p>

<p>NOTE: Some other data types have very important operators as well, which I will discuss when their chapter arrives. Also, the syntax used for type casting also used <em>casting operators</em>.</p>

<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>

<p>The four basic arithmetic operators you've known all your life are available, plus a few more.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Operator</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>+</code></p>
			</td>

			<p>Addition</p>
			</td>

			<p>Exponentiation</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$a = 1 + 2 - 2; //$a is 1
$b = 2 * 2 / 4; //$b is 1
$c = 2**4       //$c is 2^4 = 2*2*2*2 = 16
</pre>

<h2>Incrementing/Decrementing</h2>

<p>Adding exactly one to a number, or subtracting one from it, is such a common operation that it has its own operators. Be sure to notice, however, that placing this operator before or after the variable makes a huge difference.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Operator</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>$x++</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Adds 1 to $x, then returns $x.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>$x--</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Subtracts 1 from $x, then returns $x</p>
			</td>

			<td>
			<p><code>++$x</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns $x, then adds 1 to $x</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>--$x</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns $x, then subtracts 1 from $x</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="php">
$a = 0;
$b = $a++; //$b is 1, $a is 1
$b = ++$a; //$b is 1, $a is 2
</pre>

<h2>Assignment Operators</h2>

<p>Not so long ago I told you: "computers can't have loose data flying around". Similar to how we store temporary results in our head when performing mental arithmetic, computers always need to store the results of a certain computation somewhere. In real life, people could say things like <em>1 + 1 = 2</em> or <em>1 * 2 * 3 = 6</em>. Not in the computer world.</p>

<p>Every statement where you assign a value, you <strong>must</strong> have a variable on the left hand side, and all the values and operators on the right hand side. So, every time you want to update a variable, you simply assign its old value <em>plus</em> some additional computations.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$a = 5;
$a = $a + 5; //$a is 10
$a + 5; //ERROR.
</pre>

<p>NOTE: For those that don't know: we've seen in the beginning that we can use the <em>assignment operator</em> ( <code>=</code> ) to assign a value to a variable; everything on the left of that operator is called the <em>left hand side</em>, and everything on the right the <em>right hand side</em>. Also, every value or variable around an operator is called an <em>operand</em>.</p>

<p>This seems tedious and verbose, so you'll be happy to hear there's a much shorter and easier way to write these assignments.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Operator</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Shorthand</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Full</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>+=</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>x += y</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>x = x + y</code></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>-=</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>x -= y</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>x = x - y</code></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>*=</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>x *= y</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>x = x * y</code></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>/=</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>x /= y</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>x = x / y</code></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>%=</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>x %= y</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>x = x % y</code></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>**=</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>x **= y</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>x = x**y</code></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>I think this is a very important concept to understand completely, as you'll need it very often, and it works the exact same way in all programming languages. You just need to remind yourself that you can't have loose data---everything needs to be saved into a variable. (Or put into a function.)</p>

<p>NOTE: Knowing this, we can see that the <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> operators are just shortcuts for <code>+= 1</code> and <code>-= 1</code>.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$a = 10; 
$a += 5; //$a is 15
$a *= 2; //$a is 30
</pre>

<h2>Not a Number</h2>

<p>What would happen if we were to (accidentally) use these operators with other data types than floats or integers? In most cases, it would just throw an error. There are three special cases though:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Booleans</strong>: the value <code>true</code> resolves to the integer 1, while <code>false</code> resolves to 0.</li>
	<li><strong>Strings</strong>: When converting strings to integers, PHP expects the number to be at the start of the string. It tries to make the number as large as possible. So, if a string doesn't contain a number at the start, it will always resolve to <code>0</code>.</li>
	<li><strong>Special Floats</strong>: There are some floating point numbers that can be written down or calculated with PHP, but can't be written exactly as a number. (Sounds weird, I know.) We call these <em>not a number</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Among those special floats are infinity ( <code>INF</code> ) and values that can't be calculated (such as <code>sqrt(-1.0)</code>, the square root of minus one). To check if a float is special, and therefore not a number we can perform calculations with, we use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">is_nan($float);</code>

<p>To merely check whether a value is infinite or not, which also means we can't really do anything with it, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">is_infinite($float);</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
echo "7 dwarves" + "1 snow white";   //Prints 8
echo "Dwarves, 7" + "Snow white, 1"; //Prints 0

$a = is_nan(true);       //$a is false
$a = is_nan(acos(1.1));  //$a is true
</pre>

<h2>Operator Precedence</h2>

<p>The precedence of operators is just like you're used to.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <code>**</code> operator is evaluated first</li>
	<li>The <code>*</code>, <code>/</code> and <code>%</code> are evaluated second</li>
	<li>The <code>+</code> and <code>---</code> are evaluated third</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to change this order, by grouping certain terms together, you can use the familiar parentheses ( <code>( )</code> ).</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
echo 5 + 5 * 3;   //Prints 5 + 15 = 20
echo (5 + 5) * 3; //Prints 10 * 3 = 30
</pre>

<h2>*Modulus</h2>

<p>The <em>modulus</em> of x and y is simply the remainder after dividing x by y. For example:</p>

<p class="indented">16 % 6 = 4            (because 16 / 6 = 2 with remainder 4)<br />
18 % 3 = 0            (because 18 = 3 * 6, so there's no remainder)<br />
  4 % 3 = 1            (because 4 / 3 = 1 with remainder 1)</p>

  title: "[PHP] Strings I"
  post: "<p>Now that we've discussed what to do with floats and integers, it's time to move on to the next scalar type: <em>strings</em>. PHP heavily relies on pieces of text being downloaded from servers, or uploaded to them. The famous <code>echo</code> statement can in the end only insert strings into the HTML page. That's why there's a lot of ways to alter, modify, and play with strings---and this chapter will tell you all about them.</p>

<h2>Variable Expansion</h2>

<p>You would expect that if you were to write a variable within a string, it would simply print the variable's name instead of its value. With the <em>single-quoted</em> and <em>nowdoc</em> syntax that is the case---but, the <em>double-quoted</em> and <em>heredoc</em> syntax can do something special. When you write a variable, it will <em>expand </em>it and display its value instead.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$username = "Panda";

echo 'Last log in: $username at 2PM'; //Prints: Last log in: $username at 2PM
echo "Last log in: $username at 2PM"; //Prints: Last log in: Panda at 2PM
</pre>

<h2>Escape Characters</h2>

<p>Both the single-quoted and double-quoted syntax have a problem; what should I do if I want to add an actual quote as a character? If you would just type the quote character, PHP would think the string ended and the results wouldn't be pretty. We can solve this by <strong>escaping</strong> the characters---which simply means that we add a <strong>backslash</strong> ( <code>\\</code> ) in front of it.</p>

<p>Single-quoted strings support only one escape sequence: <code>\\'</code> (to use single quotes in your text)</p>

<p>Double-quoted strings support a bunch of escape sequence:</p>

<p>NOTE: Most of these only show themselves when you start working with HTML forms and input. Also, because the newline character differs across operating systems, it's a custom on the internet to use <code>\\r\\n</code> for newlines. Just to be safe.</p>

<h2>String Operators</h2>

<p>We've seen that PHP converts strings to numbers (in a rather rude way) when we try to add them together using the mathematical operators. So, how should we combine strings? Well, we use another operator for "string addition", which is called the <strong>concatenation operator</strong> ( <code>.</code> ).</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$combinedstring = $string1 . $string2;</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
echo "Welcome, " + "my friend!"; //Prints 0, as both strings as interpreted as integers

echo "Welcome, " . "my friend!"; //Prints: Welcome, my friend!
</pre>

<h2>Operator Precedence</h2>

<p>Just as with the math operators, the concatenation operator has its own rank of importance. It has the same precedence as the <code>+</code> and <code>---</code> operator, which is great most of the time, but can lead to some nasty errors (see the example).</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
echo "Total Costs: \\$" + 50 + " USD"; //Prints: 50
echo "Total Costs: \\$" + 50 . " USD"; //Prints: 50 USD
echo "Total Costs: \\$" . 50 . " USD"; //Prints: Total Costs: $50 USD
</pre>

<h2>Accessing Characters</h2>

<p>Before I bestow upon you a large amount of useful string functions, I have one last special string syntax to explain. If you want to access a single <em>character</em> of string, you can do so with</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$string[index];</code>

<p>Here, the <em>index</em> is the position of the character within the string. Computers start counting at 0, so the first character will have index 0, the second character index 1, and so on. (This counting system is important to never ever forget, as it can save you a lot of trouble.)</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$tweet = "@pandaqi You really do like pandas, don't you?";

//If the first letter of the tweet is an at-sign
//and the second letter is NOT an empty space...
if($tweet[0] == "@" && $tweet[1] != " ") {
	//Classify the tweet as a response to somebody
	echo "The tweet is a response!";
	...
}

  title: "[PHP] Strings II"
  post: "<p>I think a practical example is in order here---all this theoretical talk about numbers and strings might start to feel a bit useless at the moment, and the last thing I want you to do is quit learning!</p>

<p>On this website, there's lots of things going on. When you access a page, it takes the URL (which is a string), and chops it up into little pieces. Based on those, it finds the article that belongs with it, and loads that post (which is one huge string) from the database. I don't like writing large bits of HTML to insert code examples, images, or other special things---so I use a much easier system. I simply invented my own special tags (such as <code>[more]</code> or <code>#LINKHERE#</code>), and I replace those tags by their complex HTML counterparts, to create a page that is dynamically created when you load it! It saves me work, it saves you work.</p>

<p>This, is the power of strings. We can extract all sorts of information from them, and without them, PHP and the world wide web would probably not exist. This chapter will discuss the most fundamental functions you can call on strings to make them dance.</p>

<h2>Changing Case</h2>

<p>Let's start simple. Sometimes you have a string where the letters are lowercase, where they should be uppercase (or vice versa). To change case, we have these functions:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Function</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>lcfirst(<em>$str</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Makes the first character of the string lowercase</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>ucfirst(<em>$str</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Makes the first character of the string uppercase</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>strtolower(<em>$str</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Makes all characters of the string lowercase</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>strtoupper(<em>$str</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Makes all characters of the string uppercase</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="php">
$mail_goodbye = "kiND reGArdS, PANDaqi";

//Let's fix this ugly sentence by making it all lowercase,
//and the first letter uppercase
echo ucfirst(strtolower($mail_goodbye));
</pre>

<p>NOTE: As you can see, function names in PHP are quite self-descriptive. Sometimes this is a good thing, sometimes this makes function names unnecessarily complicated and type-error prone.</p>

<h2>Searching</h2>

<p>We can search strings to check whether they contain certain substrings (and their position or amount of occurrences). For example, if we wanted to check if users entered a valid email address, we could check whether the string contains the "@" character.</p>

<p>NOTE: All of these functions will, if they can't find what you're looking for, or something else goes wrong, return the value <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>To search for the first occurrence of a substring, use one of these functions:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">strstr(<em>$haystack</em>, <em>$needle</em> [, <em>$before_needle</em>]);
stristr(<em>$haystack</em>, <em>$needle</em> [, <em>$before_needle</em>]);</code>

<p>This searches the string <em>$haystack</em> for the substring <em>$needle</em>, and returns everything that comes after it. The <em>$before_needle</em> parameter is optional. If you set it to true, the function will instead return everything that comes <em>before</em> the substring.</p>

<p>The difference between the first and second function is that little <code>i</code> in the middle. It means that the second function performs a case-insensitive search. Most functions have this variation, and I will point them out.</p>

<p>NOTE: I'll be using this way of describing syntax for the rest of the course, as the PHP manual (and most other programming manuals) do so as well.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$user_email = "thatawesomeguy@gmail.com";

echo strstr($user_email, "@");       //Prints @gmail.com
echo strstr($user_email, "@", true); //Prints thatawesomeguy

$x = stristr($user_email, "girl");   //$x is false (thatawesomeguy is not thatawesomegirl)
</pre>

<p>To search for the position of a substring, use one of these functions:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">strpos(<em>$haystack</em>, <em>$needle</em> [, <em>$offset</em>]);
strrpos(<em>$haystack</em>, <em>$needle</em> [, <em>$offset</em>]);
strripos(<em>$haystack</em>, <em>$needle</em> [, <em>$offset</em>]);</code>

<p>This returns the index of the substring <em>$needle</em> in string <em>$haystack</em>. The optional <em>$offset</em> is an integer that determines from what index it starts looking; normally it starts at the first letter (index 0), but you can set it to start searching later.</p>

<p>The function <code>strpos</code> returns the first occurrence, <code>strrpos</code> the last occurrence (note the second 'r'), and <code>strripos</code> does so case-insensitively.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$user_emails = "thatawesomegirl@gmail.com | thatawesomeguy@gmail.com";

echo strpos($user_emails, "@");  //Prints 15
echo strrpos($user_emails, "@"); //Prints 42
</pre>

<h2>Substrings</h2>

<p>If you don't know the substring you're looking for, but you <em>do</em> know at what index it should be, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">substr(<em>$haystack</em>, <em>$start</em> [, <em>$length</em>]);</code>

<p>It returns the string starting from index <em>$start</em> until the end of the string. If you set <em>$length</em>, it will only return that amount of characters.</p>

<p>If you use a negative integer for <em>$start</em>, it will start that amount of characters from the <em>end</em> of the string (the same is the case for <em>$length</em>).</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$video_url = "http://youtube.com/watch?v=BH-wP2TDUBQ";

//For example, if all the videos we reference on our website are 
//from youtube, all we need is to store the ID (BH-wP2TDUBQ).

//Two identical ways to do so are:
$video_id = substr($video_url, -11);
$video_id = substr($video_url, 27);
</pre>

<p>You can also just count how many times a substring occurs in a string. For this, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">substr_count(<em>$haystack</em>, <em>$needle</em>, [<em>$offset</em>, <em>$length</em>]);</code>

<p>The <em>$length</em> parameter specifies how many characters to check after the <em>$offset</em> index. If omitted, the length is the same as the length of the whole string, which means it searches through the whole string and counts all the occurrences.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$achievements = "Got 1000 subscribers | Got 1000 views on a single day | Chose an awesome password | Invited 5 friends to the website";

//To know the total amount of achievements this user has, simply count the amount of seperators
echo substr_count($achievements, " | ") + 1;
</pre>

<h2>Cutting</h2>

<p>Now that we can find certain substrings within strings, it would be nice if we could cut them out of there, or at least divide the string into multiple substrings. For example, after having checked that the <code>@</code> character is present in a string, we would like to select the domain name to see if it is valid. We don't want <em>panda@panda</em> to resolve as a valid email address, but we do want <em>panda@gmail.com</em> to be seen as valid.</p>

<p>Let's start simple. To remove useless whitespace from a string use</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Function</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>trim(<em>$str</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Trim whitespace from both beginning and end</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>ltrim(<em>$str</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Trim whitespace only from the beginning ("from the left")</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>rtrim(<em>$str</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Trim whitespace only from the end ("from the right")</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Oh no, somebody accidentally added spaces in front of their 
//answer for our very, very important price quiz
$quiz_answer = "  RED  ";

//Fixed it.
echo trim($quiz_answer); //Prints RED
</pre>

<p>To cut a string into many substrings, you can split it into an array. For example, you could have a long string of data separated by a certain character, and then use that character to retrieve every individual piece again. For this, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">explode(<em>$delimiter</em>, <em>$haystack</em>);</code>

<p>Note that it splits the whole string at every point it finds the delimiter, but it removes all occurrences of the delimiter itself.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Oh no, the new blogger insisted on using his own syntax for storing blog post information
$post_information = "Hello dear readers, thanks for reading my blog!#22 January 2203#News#10 comments";

//Luckily, we can just split the string to get the information seperated;
print_r(explode("#", $post_information));
/*
	Array
	(
    	[0] => Hello dear readers, thanks for reading my blog!
    	[1] => 22 January 2203
    	[2] => News
    	[3] => 10 comments
	)
*/
</pre>

<h2>Replacing</h2>

<p>Last, but certainly not least, we might want to replace a piece of a string. (Instead of violently cutting it away.) (Or, you know, setting off explosions on the string.)</p>

<p>To replace <em>all</em> occurrences of a search string with a replacement string, use one of these</p>

<code class="longsyntax">str_replace(<em>$search</em>, <em>$replace</em>, <em>$haystack</em> [, <em>$count</em>]);
str_ireplace(<em>$search</em>, <em>$replace</em>, <em>$haystack</em> [, <em>$count</em>]);</code>

<p>The last parameter, if you set it, requires a <em>variable</em> to be put into it. After the function has executed, this variable will then hold the amount of replacements that have been made.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$post = "Great news! Peanut butter sales are increasing, so buy stock now!";

//Our boss read somewhere that the word Peanut makes potential customers feels uncomfortable
//Now we need to change every instance of the word with the friendlier sounding Apple
$post = str_replace("Peanut", "Apple", $post, $count_var);

echo $post;      //Prints: Great news! Apple butter sales are increasing, so buy stock now!
echo $count_var; //Prints: 1 	(because we've made one replacement)
</pre>

<p>Just as before, it's possible that we don't know the exact string, but we do know the index where it starts and ends. To perform a replacement in these cases, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">substr_replace(<em>$haystack</em>, <em>$replace</em>, <em>$start</em> [, <em>$length</em>]);</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Let's say our comment system allows users to make their comments red
//To enable this fancy functionality, they need to start their comment with the word PANDA
$comment = "PANDAWow, this post was very informative!";

//Replace the first five characters with an opening HTML tag
$comment = substr_replace($comment, '<span style="color:red;">', 0, 5);

//Then add a closing tag at the end
$comment .= "</span>";

echo $comment;
//Prints a red comment reading "Wow, this post was very informative!"

  title: "[PHP] Conditionals"
  post: "<p>After all this talk about floats, integers, and strings, you might start to think---<em>Booleans can only be true or false, how important could they possibly be?</em> Well, extremely important. And that's an understatement.</p>

<p>To computers, the world is binary and exact. Computers can't "sorta execute this", or "just try to do this or that". They either do it, or they don't. Something is either executed exactly as it was written, or it isn't executed at all. Therefore, we must use Booleans to tell the computer when to execute which pieces of code.</p>

<p>For example, we could check whether a user is logged in. If the check returns <em>true</em>, we can execute a piece of code that welcomes him and throws confetti into his face. If the check returns <em>false</em>, we display a login page. A user can't be "sort of logged in"---he either is, or he isn't.</p>

<p>Similarly, we could check whether a search query was successful, by checking the amount of results it returned. We could write a piece of code that checks whether or not that amount is greater than 0. If the check returns <em>true</em>, we have results and we should display them. If the check returns <em>false</em>, we have no results and we should suggest a different query to the user. A query can't have more than zero results, yet zero results---either there are results, or there aren't.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, we have another set of operators at our disposable for this important aspect of PHP; the <strong>comparison operators</strong> and <strong>logical operators</strong>. Both of these are <em>conditional operators</em>, and using them creates a <em>conditional</em>---a certain condition under which the program should or shouldn't do something.</p>

<h2>Comparison Operators</h2>

<p>In our examples above, we already saw how we could compare two values to get a truth value. As it turns out, comparison is the best and only way to do so; is this greater than that? Or is this less than that? Or is this equal to that?</p>

<p>Therefore, if you place any of the following comparison operators between two operands, PHP will not perform some arithmetic operation---instead, it will check whether the comparison is true or false, and return that.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Operator</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Name</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>==</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Equal</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if both operands are equal (after type conversion)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>===</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Identical</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if both operands are equal, and of the same data type</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>!=</code><br />
			<code><></code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Not Equal</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if both operands are not equal (after type conversion)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>!==</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Not Identical</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if both operands are not equal, or not of the same data type</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code><</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Less than</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the left hand side is less than the right hand side</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>></code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Greater than</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the left hand side is greater than the right hand side</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code><=</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Less than or equal to</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the left hand side is less than or equal to the right hand side</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>>=</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Greater than or equal to</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the left hand side is greater than or equal to the right hand side</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="php">
//This is true, because "2" and 2 have the same integer value
$cond = (2 == "2");

//This is false, because "2" and 2 are not identical (one is integer, one is string)
$cond = (2 === "2");

//This is true, because "Panda" is equal to "Panda"
$cond = ("Panda" <= "Panda");

//This is false, because true is the same as true
$cond = (true != true);
</pre>

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>

<p>Performing one comparison is great, but it's usually not enough. For example, if a user logs in we want to check whether the username matches the password. In other words, only if our check for the username returns true, <em>and</em> our check for the password returns true as well, we can log the user in. To combine conditionals, we can use the following logical operators:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Operator</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Name</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>and</code><br />
			<code>&amp;&amp;</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Logical AND</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if both operands are true</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>or</code><br />
			<code>||</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Logical OR</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if either the left <em>or</em> the right operand is true, or both</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>xor</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Logical XOR</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if either the left <em>or</em> the right operand is true, but <em>not</em> both</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>!</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Logical NOT</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the operand is not true. (It negates the value.)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="php">
$password = "1234";
$username = "Ginty";

//This is true, because both password and username are correct
$cond = ($password === "1234" && $username === "Ginty");

//This is false, because both are true, so the inversion is false
$cond = (!($password === "1234" && $username === "Ginty"));

//This is not secure; it already returns true if only one of the two is correct!
$cond = ($password === "1234" || $username === "Ginty");

//If a user has at least 10 credits, or it is a new user, return true
//(so that we can level up the user, or give him bonus credits, or whatever)
$cond = ($credits_total >= 10 || $new_user);
</pre>

<p>NOTE: Even though the function of <code>and</code> and <code>&amp;&amp;</code> is exactly the same, just as <code>or</code> and <code>||</code>, there's a difference in precedence. The shorthand operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> have a higher precedence than <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>, which means they are evaluated first.</p>

  title: "[PHP] Control Flow"
  post: "<p>Now that we've seen how to create conditionals, we can look at how to actually use them. The name of this chapter---Control Flow---is just a fancy name for controlling which parts of the code the program executes, and which it doesn't. You can use the result of conditionals to control the flow of a program; does it go into this direction, or that direction?</p>

<p>To do so, we have <em>if statements</em> (and its related brothers and sisters). They are quite intuitive actually; if a certain condition is true, do that. Because you'll be using some kinds of if statements a lot, PHP also provides a few special <em>conditional operators</em> again to make our lives easier.</p>

<h2>The if Statement</h2>

<p>To execute a certain block of code only <strong>if</strong> a certain condition is true, we use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">if(<em>condition</em>) { <em>lots of statements</em> }</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
$logged_in = ($password === "1234" && $username === "Ginty");

//If the username and password entered are correct...
if($logged_in) {
	//...welcome the logged in user
	echo "Welcome, $username!";
}
</pre>

<h2>The else Statement</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a game that changed its settings based on what time it was. If it was night, it would display a dark background, if it was day, it would display a light background. Undoubtedly, this game used an <strong>else</strong> statement.</p>

<p>An <strong>else</strong> statement is executed if the condition within the preceding if statement returns false. In normal language you would say: if this condition is true, do this, else do that. The syntax is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">else { <em>lots of statements</em> }</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
$hours = 20;

//If it's morning or afternoon...
if($hours <= 18) {
	echo "Good day!";
//Else if it's night ($hours > 18)
} else {
	echo "Good night!";
}
</pre>

<h2>The else if Statement</h2>

<p>Now, suppose that game wanted to be more dynamic and display three different backgrounds. Night would mean a black background, daylight a bright background, and morning a neutral background. This would be the perfect situation for an <strong>else if</strong> statement!</p>

<p>The else if statement is executed when the previous condition is false, <em>and</em> checks for a new condition. In normal language: if this condition is true, do this, else if this other condition is true, do that. The syntax is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">else if(<em>condition</em>) { <em>lots of statements</em> }</code>

<p>You can put as many of these after each other as you need. The first must, however, always follow an <code>if</code> statement.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$hours = 20;

if($hours < 12) {
	echo "Good morning!";
} else if($hours <= 18){
	echo "Good day!";
} else {
	echo "Good night!";
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>else</code> statement, if you decide to include it, must always be put at the end of such an if---elseif construction. In any case, it only executes if <em>all</em> the other conditions have returned false.</p>

<p>NOTE: It's highly recommended to always use <code>else</code> as the last statement in the construction, and not <code>else if</code>. That's because the latter requires another condition, which requires more work from you to type, and if anything changes within the program, you have to change that condition as well.</p>

<h2>The Ternary Operator</h2>

<p>By far the most common conditional structure you'll use is: if this condition is true, set a variable to that value, else set it to another value. That's why the <strong>ternary operator</strong> was invented to reduce the amount of work! The syntax is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$variable = <em>condition</em> ? <em>value if true</em> : <em>value if false</em>;</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
// A simple piece of code to make a player in a game
// face in the direction he's running
$player_velocity = -20;

//LONG syntax
if($player_velocity > 0) {
	$player_direction = 1;
} else {
	$player_direction = -1;
}

//SHORT syntax
$player_direction = ($player_velocity > 0) ? 1 : -1;
</pre>

<h2>The Spaceship Operator</h2>

<p>Another common conditional structure, is where you want to check whether two values are the same, or if one is less/greater than the other. You could do this with an if-elseif-else statement, but the <strong>spaceship operator</strong> (dumdumdumduuuum) makes this much easier.</p>

<p>It compares the two operands, and</p>

<ul>
	<li>Returns <code>0</code> if both operands are equal</li>
	<li>Returns <code>1</code> if the left operand is greater</li>
	<li>Returns <code>-1</code> if the right operand is greater.</li>
</ul>

<p>The syntax is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">x <=> y</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
$points_player_1 = 160;
$points_player_2 = 240;

$result = $points_player_1 <=> $points_player_2;

if($result === 0) {
	echo "It's a tie";
} else if($result === 1) {
	echo "Player 1 won!";
} else {
	echo "Player 2 won!";
}
</pre>

<h2>Null Coalescing</h2>

<p>The last common conditional structure, is one where you want to check whether some variable is null before you start doing anything with it. Because, if you don't, you'll likely run into lots of errors because the variable isn't properly set. To easily set a default value for a variable if it happens to be null, use the <strong>null coalescing</strong> operator. The syntax is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">x ?? y</code>

<p>Because it's an operator, you can chain it as many times as you want. In that case, it will return the first value that is not null.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Say a user requested a blog post.

//If, for some reason, the post can't be found and the request returns null..
//display the newest post to satisfy the user - if that returns null as well...

<h2>Integration with HTML</h2>

<p>Here I just want to point out the very important property of PHP we also saw at the beginning---it integrates seamlessly with HTML. So, we don't have to restrict our control structures to PHP statements only. We can place an if statement, then break out of PHP mode and write some regular HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and then get into PHP mode again to close the if statement. This way, we let PHP decide whether whole chunks of HTML are displayed or not, based on certain conditions.</p>

  title: "[PHP] Arrays I"
  post: "<p>Having looked intensively at the four scalar data types, it's time to move on to compound types; arrays and objects.</p>

> An array is nothing more than a list of values.

<p>They are incredibly useful for grouping huge amounts of related data. Once saved inside an array, you can perform all sorts of operations on it - such as sorting or combining the data. For example, I could retrieve all the usernames of users that are currently in a chat room, put them inside an array, sort them alphabetically, and then display them to all other users with some HTML markup around them.</p>

<p>NOTE: The values of an array are called its <em>elements</em>.</p>

<h2>Types of Arrays</h2>

<p>There are many types of lists in the real world---grocery lists, step-by-step lists, definition-explanation lists---which means we need versatile arrays. That's why PHP arrays can, unlike some other programming languages, store values of different data type. For example, some elements can be integers while others are strings.</p>

<p>Additionally, we need to be able to retrieve the <em>value</em> of an element by accessing its <em>key</em>. For example, we could save a value "5 dollars" under the key "price". There are three different types of arrays, based on how they use these key-value pairs:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Indexed Arrays: </strong>The key of an element is a numeric index. Just as with strings, the first element of the array has index 0, the next one has index 1, and so on.</li>
	<li><strong>Associative Arrays:</strong> The key of an element is a string or integer. In this case, the keys can be anything you like. (But they can't be other data types, such as float or Boolean.)</li>
	<li><strong>Multidimensional Arrays:</strong> The values are arrays! By placing an array inside an array, we basically create a table with rows and columns of data. (And, by adding even more arrays, we could make it three-dimensional and higher.) But, all of this is advanced stuff that will be discussed later.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating an Array</h2>

<p>Arrays are flexible. Based on what syntax you use to define its elements, the array changes its type for you. To create an <em>indexed array</em>, use one of the following two syntaxes</p>

<code class="longsyntax">array(value<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, value<sub>n</sub>);
[value<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, value<sub>n</sub>];</code>

<p>This could only create an indexed array, because we've only provided values and no keys.</p>

<p>To create an <em>associative array</em>, use one of these two syntaxes</p>

<code class="longsyntax">array(key<sub>1</sub> => value<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, key<sub>n</sub> => value<sub>n</sub>);
[key<sub>1</sub> => value<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, key<sub>n</sub> => value<sub>n</sub>];</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
$shopping_cart = ["Bicycle", "Plush Toy", "Table Tennis Table"];
print_r($shopping_cart);
/* Prints:
Array
(
    [0] => Bicycle
    [1] => Plush Toy
    [2] => Table Tennis Table
)
*/

$bicycle_info = ["price" => 10, "colour" => "red", "gears" => 5, "forsale" => true];
print_r($bicycle_info);
/* Prints:
Array
(
    [price] => 10
    [colour] => red
    [gears] => 5
    [forsale] => 1
)
*/
</pre>

<p>NOTE: PHP will automatically try to cast strings to integers, if possible, because indexed arrays are easier and faster to handle than associative ones. So, don't add numbers enclosed in quotes as keys (like <code>"1"</code>), because they will be converted to numeric indexes---and you will be confused.</p>

<h2>Accessing Elements</h2>

<p>We've now seen how to set an array's values when you define it, but what if we want to add/remove or get/set a value later on? We can use the bracket-syntax---which we also used for accessing characters of a string---to refer to a single element of the array:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$somearray[key];</code>

<p>Note that this key can be an integer index, or a string---the syntax is the same. Also note that we can use the assignment operator (just as we would with variables) to assign a new value.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$shopping_cart = ["Bicycle", "Plush Toy", "Table Tennis Table"];
echo $shopping_cart[1]; //Prints: Plush Toy
</pre>

<p>When you assign a value to a key that doesn't exist within the array, PHP will be nice and add this new key-value pair to the array for you. On the other hand, to remove an element, you need to use <code>unset()</code> again (just as with regular variables).</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$shopping_cart = ["Bicycle", "Plush Toy", "Table Tennis Table"];
echo $shopping_cart[5]; //Prints error that no element exists with index 5

$shopping_cart[5] = "Laptop";
echo $shopping_cart[5]; //Prints Laptop

unset($shopping_cart[5]); //Now it's been removed from the array again
</pre>

<h2>Array Operators</h2>

<p>Arrays, just like the other datatypes, support operators as well. Because it's a list of things, however, they change their meaning if both operands are arrays. If only one operand is an array, these will throw an error.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Operator</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Name</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Result</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>+</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Union</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Combines two arrays, and removes duplicate elements</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>==</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Equality</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if both arrays have the same key/value pairs</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>===</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Identity</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if both arrays have the same key/value pairs, in the same order, and of the same data type</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>!=</code><br />
			<code><></code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Inequality</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if both arrays don't have the exact same key/value pairs</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>!==</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Non-identity</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if both arrays don't have the exact same key/value pairs, or in a different order, or values of different data types</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="php">
$user_login = ["usn" => "Ginty", "pwd" => "1234"];
$user_profile = ["pet" => "Panda", "gender" => "Girl"];

$user = $user_login + $user_profile; //Contains all information on the user

$user_login_1 = ["usn" => "Ginty", "pwd" => "1234"];
$user_login_2 = ["pwd" => "1234", "usn" => "Ginty"];

//Prints bool(false), because key-value pairs are exactly the same
var_dump($user_login_1 <> $user_login_2); 

//Prints bool(true), because the order is different
var_dump($user_login_1 !== $user_login_2);
</pre>

<p>NOTE: Even though it's not possible to cast an array onto some other type, it <em>is</em> possible to cast scalar types to arrays. The result will be an array with a single element at index 0, with the scalar as its value.</p>

<h2>Retrieving the Length</h2>

<p>You'll be retrieving the length of an array quite often, because you either want to display how many items are in a list, or want to go through all the elements of the array. (Which we'll discuss in the chapters on <em>Loops</em>.) To do so, use one of these:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">sizeof($array);
count($array);</code>

<p>They do exactly the same (they are called <em>aliases</em>)---just pick the one you're most likely to remember. Also keep in mind that, in the case of indexed arrays, the last element of the array has index (<em>length-1</em>), because we start counting from 0.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$users = ["Ginty", "Juan", "Mark", "Avocado", "BATMAN"];
echo sizeof($users); //Prints 5
</pre>

<h2>Glue</h2>

<p>Just as we could explode a string into an array, we can glue all the elements of an array together into a string. To do so, use one of these (again, they do exactly the same):</p>

<code class="longsyntax">implode(separator, $array);
join(separator, $array);</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Suppose we want to thank all our users for their contribution in a single sentence
$users = ["Ginty", "Juan", "Mark", "Avocado", "BATMAN"];

echo "Thanks to " . implode(", ", $users) . "!";
//Prints Thanks to Ginty, Juan, Mark, Avocado, Batman!
</pre>

<h2>Adding/Removing Elements</h2>

<p>For the quizzing system on this website, I dynamically create an array full of random, wrong answers and one right answer I fetch from my question database. It would be a pain to have to shift all the current elements one position to the right so I can add a new one at the start. Fortunately, PHP has some nice methods for adding/removing elements from the start/end of arrays.</p>

<p>To add elements at the <em>start</em> of the array (and therefore shift all the other elements one position to the right), use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">array_unshift($array, value<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, value<sub>n</sub>);</code>

<p>To add elements at the <em>end</em> of an array, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">array_push($array, value<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, value<sub>n</sub>);</code>

<p>To remove the <em>first</em> element of an array (and therefore shift all the other elements one position to the left), use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">array_shift($array);</code>

<p>To remove the <em>last</em> element of an array, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">array_pop($array);</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
$users_in_chatroom = ["Ginty", "Juan", "Mark", "Avocado", "BATMAN"];

//Hey, Laura just came into the chatroom!
array_push($users_in_chatroom, "Laura");

//But, Ginty hates Laura, so she leaves
array_shift($users_in_chatroom);

//Now Laura is upset as well, so she leaves
array_pop($users_in_chatroom);

/*Now the array is 
Array
(
    [0] => Juan
    [1] => Mark
    [2] => Avocado
    [3] => BATMAN
)
*/

  title: "[PHP] Arrays II"
  post: "<p>Last chapter discussed the most important functions and operators you can use with arrays, but they still can't do everything. Just as I did with strings, I want to use this chapter to outline other extremely useful functions to use with arrays---such as <em>cutting a subarray</em>, <em>searching for specific keys or values</em>, and <em>sorting </em>the array.</p>

<h2>Subarrays</h2>

<p>We've already seen how we can select a single element of the array, but what if we want to select multiple elements? Well, then your selection is a list, which means it is a subarray! (Just as with substrings.)</p>

<p>To get part of an array, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">array_slice(<em>$array</em>, <em>offset</em> [, <em>length</em>, <em>preserve_keys</em>]);</code>

<p>The slice starts at index <em>offset</em>, and takes <em>length</em> amount of elements. If it's not set, it will end the slice at the end of the array. Note that this does not alter the original array; it simply returns the slice so you can use it.</p>

<p>If you're working with indexed arrays, PHP will automatically reorder the keys of the slice so that they start at index 0. Set <em>preserve_keys</em> to true if you want to prevent this.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Oh no, somehow, some wrong information entered the array
$tweet_information = ["just setting up my twttr", "21 March 2006", "Jack", "250 retweets", "PANDAS ARE COOL", "CRISPS ARE DELICIOUS"];

//Luckily, we can slice out the right information
$tweet_information = array_slice($tweet_information, 0, 4);

//The result is ["just setting up my twttr", "22 January 2016", "Jack", "250 retweets"];
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the following syntax to remove a portion of the array and perhaps replace it:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">array_splice(<em>$array</em>, <em>offset</em> [, <em>length</em>, <em>$replacement_array</em>]);</code>

<p>The elements from the <em>$replacement_array</em> are inserted at the <em>offset</em> index. Note that it only replaces the elements it removes---so, if you remove say five elements, and the replacement array contains ten, it will only insert the first five.</p>

<p>The function itself returns the elements that have been removed, but it also alters the original array (unlike the <code>array_slice()</code> function).</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$user = ["downvotes received" => 24, "upvotes received" => 7, "comments" => 5, "forum posts" => 15];

//If we only care about his/her votes, we could remove the other two elements
array_splice($user, 2);

//Or we can replace them with other information regarding votes
array_splice($user, 2, 2, ["downvotes given" => 3, "upvotes given" => 8]);

//Or we can do something with the elements we've removed
$comments_and_posts = array_splice($user, 2);
</pre>

<h2>Searching</h2>

<p>To check if a value exists in an array, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">in_array(<em>$needle</em>, <em>$haystack</em> [, <em>$strict</em>]);</code>

<p>This searches for the value <em>$needle</em> in the array <em>$haystack</em>. If you set the third parameter to <em>true</em>, it also requires that the data type is the same. The functions returns <code>true</code> if it finds the value, and <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$grocery_list = ["Butter", "Pizza", "Chocolate", "Milk"];

//If there's milk on our grocery list...
if(in_array("Milk", $grocery_list)) {
	//...notify the milk man!
}
</pre>

<p>Sometimes, though, you want to get the key that belongs to a certain value. For that, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">array_search(<em>$needle</em>, <em>$haystack</em> [, <em>$strict</em>]);</code>

<p>If it can't find the value, and therefore can't find the key, it returns <code>false</code>.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$grocery_list = ["Butter", "Pizza", "Chocolate", "Milk"];

var_dump( array_search("Milk", $grocery_list) ); //Prints int(3)
var_dump( array_search("Pancakes", $grocery_list) ); //Prints bool(false). Aww, no pancakes today.
</pre>

<p>Lastly, to check if a certain key is within an array, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">array_key_exists(<em>$needle</em>, <em>$haystack</em>);</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
$comment = ["message" => "Hey Juan, nice holiday photos! Really dig your beard.", 
			"timestamp" => "May 30 2016, 2PM",
			"from" => "Ginty",
			"reply" => true];

if(array_key_exists("reply", $comment)){
	//notify Juan that he has a reply to his fabulous holiday photographs.
}
</pre>

<h2>Compare &amp; Replace</h2>

<p>The following functions can be used for performing certain operations between multiple arrays:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Function</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>array_diff(<em>$arr1</em>, <em>$arr2</em>)</code></p>

			<td>
			<p>Returns the values from <em>$arr1</em> that are not present in <em>$arr2</em></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>array_intersect(<em>$arr1</em>, <em>$arr2</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns the values from <em>$arr1</em> that are also present in <em>$arr2</em></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>array_combine(<em>$keys</em>, <em>$values</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns an array with the elements from <em>$keys</em> as keys, and elements from <em>$values</em> as values.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>array_merge(<em>$arr1</em>, <em>$arr2</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Appends the elements from <em>$arr2</em> to the end of <em>$arr1</em>. Duplicate keys will be set to the value from <em>$arr2</em>.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>array_replace(<em>$arr1</em>, <em>$arr2</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Replaces values from <em>$arr1</em> with values from <em>$arr2</em>, if they have the same key.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Say we're writing a system for Santa Claus to manage his presents
$wishlist_papa = ["Beer", "Television", "Cat"];
$wishlist_mama = ["Lipstick", "Mirror", "Cat"];

//Result: [Beer, Television, Lipstick, Mirror]
array_diff($wishlist_papa, $wishlist_mama); 

//Result: [Cat]
array_intersect($wishlist_papa, $wishlist_mama); 

//Result: [Beer => Lipstick, Television => Mirror, Cat => Cat]
array_combine($wishlist_papa, $wishlist_mama); 

//Result: [Beer, Television, Lipstick, Mirror, Cat]
array_merge($wishlist_papa, $wishlist_mama); 

//Result: [Lipstick, Mirror, Cat]
array_replace($wishlist_papa, $wishlist_mama); 

//Obviously, Santa Claus is going to use the intersection to minimize his costs
</pre>

<p>NOTE: All methods, except for combine, can actually accept as many arrays as you want, as long as you provide at least two.</p>

<h2>Sorting</h2>

<p>Up until now, the order of an array is simply the order in which you put in the values, and it hasn't really mattered much. There are many cases imaginable, however, where sorting an array is a crucial action. Obvious cases are when you want to display lists in alphabetical order, but you also need it to display blog posts from newest to oldest or display comments ordered on how many upvotes they have.</p>

<p>To do so, PHP has these functions available to us:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Function</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>sort(<em>$arr</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Sort an array in ascending order</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>rsort(<em>$arr</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Sort an array in descending order</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>asort(<em>$arr</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Sort an associative array in ascending order, according to value</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>ksort(<em>$arr</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Sort an associative array in ascending order, according to key</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>arsort(<em>$arr</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Sort an associative array in descending order, according to value</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>krsort(<em>$arr</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Sort an associative array in descending order, according to key</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>shuffle(<em>$arr</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Randomly orders the elements of an array.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p><em>How does PHP sort values?</em> First it sorts alphabetically (strings), then numerically (integers, floats, Booleans). For sorting alphabetically, it uses <em>lexicographical</em> ordering, which simply means that it uses the same ordering as dictionaries---first check the first character, then the next one, then the next one, and so on. For sorting numerically, the order is the same as the one you're used to---0, 1, 2, and so on.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$users = ["Ginty", "Juan", "Mark", "Avocado", "BATMAN"];

sort($users);  //Results in ["Avocado", "BATMAN", "Ginty", "Juan", "Mark"];
rsort($users); //Results in ["Mark", "Juan", "Ginty", "BATMAN", "Avocado"];
</pre>

<p>NOTE: Only lowercase characters are supported for string ordering.</p>

<p>Lastly, PHP also has an easy function to reverse the current order of an array:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">array_reverse(<em>$arr</em> [, <em>$preserve_keys</em>]);</code>

<p>The <em>$preserve_keys</em> parameter, if set to true, will preserve numeric indexes. String keys are always preserved.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$users = ["Ginty", "Juan", "Mark", "Avocado", "BATMAN"];

array_reverse($users); 
//Results in ["BATMAN", "Avocado", "Mark", "Juan", "Ginty"];

array_reverse($users, true); 
/* Results in 
   Array (
	  ["4"] => "BATMAN", 
	  ["3"] => "Avocado", 
	  ["2"] => "Mark", 
	  ["1"] => "Juan", 
	  ["0"] => "Ginty", 
  )

  title: "[PHP] Loops"
  post: "<p>Sometimes you want a piece of code to be executed a lot of times (especially with arrays). For example, say you wanted to calculate the total price of all items in a shopping cart. Then you could access each item separately, and add that to the total sum, and copy that line of code dozens of times. But, a much easier way would be to put all prices in an array, and execute a single line of code (that accesses the next element in the array and adds the value to the total) lots of times. For this, <em>loops</em> have been invented.</p>

> A loop allows you to easily execute the same block of code as many times as you want.

<p>Arrays are the typical use case, but they are applicable everywhere---I promise you, you'll be writing lots of loops in your programming life. Loops can run indefinitely, or a fixed amount of iterations. And, of course, you can use variables in the loop to slightly change the block of code that's being executed every time.</p>

<h2>While</h2>

<p>The <em>while loop</em> is the easiest, and simply keeps looping a block as long as a certain condition returns true.  Just as with if statements, it's rather intuitive: while this condition is true, keep doing this.</p>

<code class="longsyntax">while(<em>condition</em>) {
	<em>lots of statements</em>
}</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
//SCRIPT: Find all the divisors of a number
$x = 52;
$divisors = [];
$i = 2;

//As long as the following condition is true
while($i <= $x*0.5) {
	//Check if the current number ($i) can divide $x
	if(is_integer($x / $i)) {
		//If so, add it to the divisors array
		array_push($divisors, $i);
	}
	$i++;
}

//The result should be [2,4,13,26], which are all the divisors of 52, so it works!
</pre>

<p>This loop, however, can keep going on <em>forever</em>---which will freeze the computer or lead to other unpleasant consequences. Therefore, you must make sure that there's always a possibility that the condition returns false, and you break out of the loop.</p>

<h2>Do-While</h2>

<p>Another problem with the while loop, is that there's the possibility that it never runs---not even once---if the condition is false to begin with. To execute a block of statements once with certainty, and then enter a while loop, we use a <em>do-while loop</em>.</p>

<code class="longsyntax">do {
	<em>lots of statements</em>
} while (<em>condition</em>);</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Say we want to display a random quote on the homepage, but we don't want the quote to be the same as one we've used the past 3 days
$old_quotes = ["To be or not to be", "Never stop dreaming", "C'est la Vie"];


do {
	$new_quote = //get a new quote from the database...;
} while (in_array($new_quote, $old_quotes));
//... and keep trying for as long as the quote we've chosen is one of the 3 old quotes
</pre>

<p>NOTE: As you can see, had the loop from the example been a simple while loop, the variable <code>$new_quote</code> would not exist, so it wouldn't have worked out.</p>

<h2>For</h2>

<p>When you know exactly how many times you want the loop to run, a <em>for loop</em> is usually better. For example, for loops are typically used to go through elements of an indexed array and do something with them. You know the length of the array, so you know exactly how many iterations you're going to need. The syntax is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">for(<em>initializer</em>; <em>condition</em>; <em>updater</em>){
	<em>lots of statements</em>
}</code>

<p>The <strong>initializer</strong> is run once at the start of the loop, and declares a variable and its starting value. This variable is called the <em>iterator</em>, and usually denoted with a simple <code>$i</code>.</p>

<p>The <strong>condition</strong> is checked at the end of every loop. If it's still true, it will do another round, if not, it breaks out of the loop.</p>

<p>The <strong>updater</strong> is called at the end of every loop, and updates one or multiple variables. Usually, it simply increments the iterator (by one).</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$shopping_cart = ["Playmobil", "LEGO", "Candy"];

//Loop through all the items within the shopping cart
for($i = 0; $i<sizeof($shopping_cart); $i++) {
	//and display their number and value
	echo "Item $i: $shopping_cart[$i] <br/>";
}

/*The loop should print
	Item 0: Playmobil
	Item 1: LEGO
	Item 2: Candy
*/
</pre>

<p>NOTE: You can declare multiple variables in the initializer, as long as you separate them by a comma.</p>

<h2>For-Each</h2>

<p>The for loop is great for going through indexed arrays, or doing anything else related with numbers, but what if we have an associative array? We use the <em>for-each loop</em> instead. This loop was made specifically for arrays and objects, and goes through all the key-value pairs. There are two syntaxes:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">foreach(<em>$array</em> as <em>$value</em>) {
	<em>lots of statements</em>
}</code>

<code class="longsyntax">foreach(<em>$array</em> as <em>$key</em> => <em>$value</em>) {
	<em>lots of statements</em>
}</code>

<p>In the first syntax, you can only use the value of the current element. In the second syntax, you can use both the key and the value.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Say we want to send every user a "personalized" email
$user_list = ["Ginty", "Juan", "Juan's Brother", "Juan's Guineapig", "BATMAN"];

foreach($user_list as $user) {
	$message = "Hello, $user. Thanks for using our service. Regards, the team.";
}

//Now suppose we want to tell the user how many others have signed up for the service before him/her
foreach($user_list as $rank => $user) {
	$message = "Hello, $user. Thanks for using our service. $rank people have gone before you, and are still happy! Regards, the team.";
}
</pre>

<h2>The break Keyword</h2>

<p>Sometimes you want to break out of a loop prematurely. For example, if you use a loop on an array to find a certain combination of values, you can stop the loop once it has been found. To exit the current loop, use the <code>break</code> keyword.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you want to break out of multiple loops at once, you can supply an integer behind the keyword.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$comments = ["Ginty" => "Great post!", "BATMAN" => "I'M BATMAN.", "Juan" => "Wow, I'm never looking at turtles the same way again", "Gandalf" => "Fly, you fools!"];

//We think batman is a very valuable customer, so we want to know if he left a comment
//If so, we don't need to go through the rest of the loop, so we can break out to save resources
foreach($comments as $user => $message) {
	if($user === 'BATMAN') {
		echo "Found him.";
		break;
	}
}
</pre>

<h2>The continue Keyword</h2>

<p>Instead of completely breaking out of a loop, you can also choose to go to the next iteration prematurely. For example, you could accidentally have some null values in your array, and if that's the case you don't want the rest of the loop code to run (as it will probably throw some errors). To continue to the next iteration, use the <code>continue</code> keyword.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you want to skip multiple iterations, you can supply an integer behind the keyword.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Our super secret spy agency seems to have picked up some weird signal that is going through our servers
$signal = "Kthe liSJo7VnC FJhas0 beeEn2Z6 cONoVmpA0HJrComiYsed. i 93rYepOZeaEHt,6 tPhH52HYe lioVTn hasXJ BPbeeTTnK V2cKLomIpr7Y3TSom85ised.";

//Juan thinks that we can retrieve the original message by cutting away all numbers and capital letters
$actual_message = "";
for($i = 0;$i<strlen($signal);$i++) {
	//If it's an integer, continue
	if(is_integer($signal[$i])) {
		continue;
	}
	//If transforming the letter to uppercase doesn't change anything, it's a capital letter, so continue
	if($signal[$i] != " " && strtoupper($signal[$i]) === $signal[$i]) {
		continue;
	}
	//Otherwise, we've found a piece of the original message
	$actual_message .= $signal[$i];
}

//Test it yourself to find the original message!

  title: "[PHP] Control Flow II"
  post: "<p>Last chapters introduced lots of useful blocks we can use to control the flow of a system, and before we go on to more exciting stuff, I want to provide some alternative syntaxes that might come in handy someday. I'd also like to introduce a very useful feature: <em>inserting the contents of other PHP files into the current file.</em></p>

<h2>The switch Statement</h2>

<p>Suppose that we have a system that checks for multiple states in a sign up process. If a user clicks sign up, we start at state 0, where he can choose a name. When finished, we go to state 1, where the user can input his email. This goes on until we've reached state 20.</p>

<p>Now, we could use an <em>if---elseif---else block</em> to check for all those states, but I wouldn't like to be in your position if you had to write that out. Instead, for checking the same expression against different values, we can use the more readable <em>switch statement</em>. The syntax is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">switch(<em>expression</em>) {
	case <em>value<sub>1</sub></em>:
		<em>code</em>
	case <em>value<sub>n</sub></em>:
		<em>code</em>
}</code>

<p>This checks the expression against the different cases, and executes the code underneath a case if it matches. So, in normal language: in case the expression is this value, execute the code underneath it.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//A system for leveling up users if they do something awesome on your website
$level = 2;
$status = "";

//OLD CODE
if($level == 0) {
	$status = "Beginner";
} else if($level == 1) {
	$status = "Professional";
} else {
	$status = "Wizard";
}

//NEW CODE
switch($level) {
	case 0:
		$status = "Beginner";
	case 1:
		$status = "Professional";
	case 2:
		$status = "Wizard";
}
</pre>

<p>The switch statement, however, by default executes <em>everything</em> underneath a certain case---which is called falling through cases. This can be useful if you want to execute multiple blocks of code on certain occasions, but more often than not you don't want it. To break out of the statement we---not surprisingly---use the <code>break</code> keyword again.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$result = 0;

switch($value) {
	case 0:
		$result++;
		break;
	case 1:
		$result += 5;
	case 2:
		$result -= 5;
		break;
}

//If $value is 0, $result will be 1
//If $value is 1, $result will be 0
//If $value is 2, $result will be -5
</pre>

<p>Lastly, just as the <em>else statement</em>, we would like to have a default block of code that should be executed if all the other cases are not matched. For this, we use the <code>default</code> keyword.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$search_query = "Panda";

switch(strtolower($search_query)) {
	case "tiger":
		//Display the page about tigers
	case "panda":
		//Display the page about pandas
	default:
		//Display the page with an overivew of all animal species
}
</pre>

<h2>The Alternative Syntax</h2>

<p>For most of its control structures, PHP offers an alternative syntax that you may or may not like better. This alternative syntax only replaces the opening and closing braces ( <code>{ }</code> ). It can be applied to the <em>if, else if, else, for, foreach</em>, and <em>switch </em>statements.</p>

<p>The opening brace is replaced with a colon ( <code>:</code> ). The closing brace is replaced by a word that depends on the control structure: <em>endif</em>, <em>endfor</em>, <em>endforeach</em>, and <em>endwhile</em>.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Regular syntax
if($post_category == "") {
	echo "This post was unassigned";
} else {
	echo "Category: $post_category";
}

//Alternative syntax
if($post_category == ""):
	echo "This post was unassigned";
else:
	echo "Category: $post_category";
endif;
</pre>

<p>The rest of the syntax is the same, and their function is identical. So, it's mostly a matter of preference.</p>

<p>NOTE: Do not, however, mix braces and this alternative syntax in one code block.</p>

<h2>The goto Keyword</h2>

<p>Ye be warned! The <code>goto</code> keyword is powerful, but evil. With it, you can jump to any other part of the program any time you want. This can save your life, but it also makes code unreadable and can easily lead to indecipherable errors. If you're in a situation you feel you should use this keyword, you should first check with yourself: is there really no way to restructure this program to solve all my problems?</p>

<p>Let's see how it works. To be able to specify where we want to jump to, we need to <em>label</em> a certain position in the code. This is done with the simple colon syntax:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">some_label:</code>

<p>Note that this label is <em>not</em> a string, and doesn't need quotes around it. The syntax for going to that label is then</p>

<code class="longsyntax">goto some_label;</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
$x = 0;
my_label: $x++;
if($x < 10) {
	echo $x;
	goto my_label;
}
//Prints 123456789

//But please, just use loops (or functions) instead.
</pre>

<h2>Including Code</h2>

<p>As promised, PHP allows you to easily import the contents from another PHP file. For example, most websites import the same PHP file containing the header/navigation at the top of every page. This way, if they ever were to change the navigation, they can just edit that single PHP file and everything will be fine.</p>

<p>Because this functionality so important, it's a <em>language construct</em> (just as <code>echo</code>), and uses functions that don't need parentheses around the parameter. In fact, PHP is faster without the parentheses. There are four functions for including code, all with slight differences:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Function</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>include "pathtofile"</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Includes the file. If it can't find the file at the path specified, it will search the current file's directory. If that fails, it emits a warning.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>require "pathtofile"</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Same as include, but if it can't find the file, it throws an errors and halts further execution.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>include_once "pathtofile"</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Same as include, but checks if the file has already been included somewhere. If that's the case, it doesn't do anything.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>require_once "pathtofile"</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Same as require, but checks if the file has already been included somewhere. If that's the case, it doesn't do anything.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>So, if your program strictly depends on a file, use <code>require</code>. Otherwise, use <code>include</code>.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
/** content of header.php **/
<?php
  echo "<html><head>";
  echo "<title>Awesomewebsite - Your credible source for information</title>";
  echo "</head><body>";
?>

/** content of footer.php **/
<?php 
  echo "<footer>Copyright Awesomeness Inc.</footer>";
  echo "</body></html>";
?>

/** Every other page on the website **/
<?php
  include "header.php";
?>
  lots of HTML code
<?php
  include "footer.php";
?>

  title: "[PHP] Functions"
  post: "<p>Before we can start talking about the God of all data types (Objects), I want to talk about functions and variable scope first. Not only are they insanely useful to learn and use early on, they also play a large role in understanding Objects.</p>

<p>We've already seen many of PHP's built-in functions (although there are many more to come), and this chapter will explain how you can create your own such functions.</p>

> A function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly by calling it

<p><em>Hmm, repeating a set of statements---what's the difference with a loop?</em> The difference is huge. A function can be defined anywhere within the program, but the code inside will only be executed once you call it. Furthermore, you can call the function from anywhere, anytime you want, whilst loops are rooted to the spot and can't be called.</p>

<h2>Creating a Function</h2>

<p>To define your own function, use the <strong>function</strong> keyword (ain't programming straightforward, eh?):</p>

<code class="longsyntax">function <em>some_function_name</em>() {
	<em>code</em>
}</code>

<p>Naming your own functions follows the same rules as naming variables. Just as built-in PHP functions, the name is case-insensitive.</p>

<p>Then, to call the function from anywhere, simply use the syntax you're already used to:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">some_function_name();</code>

<p>NOTE: Yes, even when a function takes no parameters, you still need to use the parentheses to tell PHP we're looking for a function with that name. We'll look at functions with parameters next.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
function print_welcome() {
	echo "Welcome everybody!";
}

print_welcome();
</pre>

<h2>Parameters &amp; Arguments</h2>

<p>Like we saw with the built-in ones, functions work at their best when they take a few parameters. You already know how to pass arguments to the function, namely with</p>

<code class="longsyntax">some_function_name(<em>arg<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>&hellip;</em>, <em>arg<sub>n</sub></em>);</code>

<p>But, how do we program the function to be able to accept these arguments and do something with them? For that we use the following syntax:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">function some_function_name(<em>$par<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>&hellip;</em>, <em>$par<sub>n</sub></em>) {
	<em>code</em>
}</code>

<p>Remember that when <em>calling</em> the function we pass in actual values (arguments), while in the function <em>definition</em> we only define variable names (parameters) to hold those values.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Here we define the function and its parameters
function print_welcome($name, $time) {
	echo "Welcome $name on this lovely $time.";
}

//Here we can pass in the arguments for every parameter
print_welcome("Juan", "afternoon"); //Prints: Welcome Juan on this lovely afternoon.
print_welcome("Batman", "night");   //Prints: Welcome Batman on this lovely night.
</pre>

<h2>Defaults</h2>

<p>Times will come when you have a crucial function that can't be allowed to fail. In those cases, you can supply a <em>default</em> value for parameters. If no argument is passed in when the function is called, the function will use the defined default value instead. The syntax is what you'd expect:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">function some_function_name($par<sub>1</sub> = <em>default_value</em>) {
	<em>code</em>
}</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
function print_welcome($name, $time = "day") {
	echo "Welcome $name on this lovely $time.";
}

print_welcome("Juan", "afternoon"); //Prints: Welcome Juan on this lovely afternoon.
print_welcome("Batman");	//Prints: Welcome Batman on this lovely day.
</pre>

<h2>The return Statement</h2>

<p>All these functions are nice, but you might struggle to find a use for them. Well, remember that nearly all built-in PHP functions <em>returned</em> something? For example, the <code>in_array()</code> function returned a value <code>true</code> (if the element was in the specified array) or <code>false</code> (if not).</p>

<p>We can do that with our own functions as well. In fact, it's so important, that it has become a <em>language construct</em> again. The syntax for returning something is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">return value;</code>

<p>When a return statement is executed, the function returns the value after it, and immediately stops executing the rest of the function. This can be useful, because you don't want to waste resources on executing other code (or even returning other values) when you've already found your value.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
function find_highest($x, $y, $z) {
	$current_highest = $x;
	if($y > $current_highest) {
		$current_highest = $y;
	}
	if($z > $current_highest) {
		$current_highest = $z;
	}
	return $current_highest;
}

$max_number = find_highest(4,10,-2);    //$max_number is 10
$max_number = find_highest(0, 0, 1000); //$max_number is 1000
</pre>

<h2>Variable Functions</h2>

<p>There's an alternative syntax for creating functions. Instead of defining a function separately from the rest of the code, you can put a function inside a variable. The variable is then said to be <em>callable</em>, and the syntax is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$some_function_name = function () { <em>code</em> };</code>

<p>Its functionality is identical to the other syntax, and the other syntax is usually regarded as more easily readable and maintainable. <em>Then why would I want to do this?</em> Because this way, you can change functions on the fly! You can assign a different function to the same variable name any time you want, and from that moment on every call made to that variable will use the new function.</p>

<p>NOTE: The dollar sign is part of the function name, don't forget to include it.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$greeting = function() {
	echo "Welcome everybody!";
};

$greeting(); //Prints: Welcome everybody!


$greeting = function() {
	echo "Goodbye my friends!";
};

$greeting(); //Prints: Goodbye my friends!
</pre>

<h2>Return Types &amp; Type Hinting</h2>

<p>Because functions usually contain important functionality, it's common to check whether the parameters are of the right data type, and whether the returned value is of the right data type. It would be a pain to have to write lots of if-statements to check those data types, which is why PHP has <strong>return types</strong> and <strong>type hinting</strong>.</p>

<p>To tell PHP that a function should return a value of a certain data type, use:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">function <em>some_function</em>() : type { <em>code</em> };</code>

<p>If the returned value is not of that type, PHP throws an error and quits. If your function shouldn't return anything, use return type <strong>void</strong>.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Signing in the user should return true if succeeded, false if not (thus, a boolean value)
function sign_in_user() : bool {
    //This line will be explained next chapter
    global $username_correct, $password_correct;
    
	if($username_correct && $password_correct) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return "SOMETHING WENT WRONG";
	}
}

$username_correct = true;
$password_correct = true;
$login = sign_in_user(); //$login is true

$username_correct = true;
$password_correct = false;
$login = sign_in_user(); //PHP throws an error and quits executing, because we returned a string.
</pre>

<p>To tell PHP that certain parameters should be of certain data types, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">function <em>some_function</em>(type $par<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, type $par<sub>n</sub>) { <em>code</em> };</code>

<p>Again, if these conditions are not met, PHP throws an error and kills a kitten. As you can see, using these return types and type hinting is completely optional---functions would work just fine without them---but it's generally recommended to use them, as it makes your code clearer and less error prone.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
function find_highest(int $x, int $y, int $z) {
	$current_highest = $x;
	if($y > $current_highest) {
		$current_highest = $y;
	}
	if($z > $current_highest) {
		$current_highest = $z;
	}
	return $current_highest;
}

$max_number = find_highest(4,10,-2);    //$max_number is 10
$max_number = find_highest(0, "two and a half", 1000); //ERROR

  title: "[PHP] Scope"
  post: "<p>Last chapter proved to use that functions kind of live in their own world; they coexist with the rest of the code in a file, but they are only executed once called, and have their own set of parameters. So, the questions that begs asking is: can functions interact with the rest of the code, and if so, how?</p>

<p>For example, what happens if one of our parameters has the same name as a variable declared somewhere else? We could frantically start adding random letters behind parameter names to make them distinct, but that's not the best way to go. Instead, PHP uses <em>scope</em>.</p>

> Scope refers to the part of a program where a certain variable is available

<p>A variable's scope can be <em>global</em>, <em>local</em>, or <em>static</em>.</p>

<h2>Global</h2>

<p>Any variable declared <em>outside</em> of a function is automatically global. It can be accessed from anywhere within the program, except from within functions.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
function multiply() {
	$x *= 2;
}

$x = 5;
$x += 5;    //Refers to the same $x, $x is no 10
multiply(); //Gives an ERROR, as the function doesn't know the global variable $x
</pre>

<h2>Local</h2>

<p>Any variable declared <em>inside</em> of a function is automatically local. It can be accessed only from within that specific function.</p>

<p>This is usually what you want, but sometimes you want to be able to change or use global variables within the function. To do so, you can tell PHP to use the global versions of a variable, with the <code>global</code> keyword:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">global $var<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, $var<sub>n</sub>;</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
function multiply() {
	global $x, $y;
	$x *= 2;
	$y *= 4;
}

$x = 4;
$y = 2;
multiply(); //$x and $y are now 8
</pre>

<p>If you intend on using both local and global versions of a variable (which can be confusing), there's an alternative syntax. PHP automatically stores all global variables in an array called <code>$GLOBALS</code>, and we can access elements of that array if we want the global version of a variable.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
function multiply() {
        //Here, $x is 16
	$x = 16;
	$GLOBALS['x'] *= 2;
}

$x = 4;
multiply(); //Here, in global scope, $x is 8
</pre>


<h2>Static</h2>

<p>Lastly, to bridge the gap between local and global scope, there's static scope. If you define a static variable within a function, it will only be usable within that function <em>but</em> it won't be deleted when the function ends. To do so, simply use the <code>static</code> keyword:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">static $var = value;</code>

<p>It is important to note that static variables are only assigned a value if they don't have a value yet. This is useful, for you can call the same function multiple times, but only the first time is a variable initialized/reset. You can only initialize static variables to a literal value though, not an expression (such as another variable).</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//You'd think that the $count variable would be reset each time, but it's only set to zero the first time it's called
function counter() {
    static $count = 0;
    $count++;
    if($count >= 3) {
    	echo "GO!";
    }
}

counter();
counter();
counter(); //Prints: GO!

echo $count; //Prints an undefined variable warning
</pre>

<p>NOTE: Static variables are still local to that particular function---you can't mindlessly use them in other functions.</p>

<h2>Constants</h2>

<p>This is great, but what if we want like a <em>super-static variable</em>---one that is accessible anywhere? Well, we can't easily do that. (They do exist, and are called <em>superglobals</em>, but we can't define them ourselves.) PHP does provide the ability, however, to define a <em>constant</em> that can be used and accessed anywhere.</p>

<p>A constant is nothing more than a variable that can't be changed. So it's simply a value that is the same for the entire program, which you can access any place, any time.</p>

<p>To define a constant, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">define(<em>"name"</em>, <em>value</em> [, <em>case_insensitivity</em>]);
const <em>name</em> = <em>value</em>;</code>

<p>If the last parameter is set to <code>true</code>, the constant is case-insensitive. (It's case-sensitive by default.) Also, the <code>const</code> keyword can only be used in global scope.</p>

<p>To use a constant, you simply call it by its name (<em>without</em> quotes).</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
function define_my_constant($name, $value) {
	define($name, $value);
	echo "Created constant $name with value $value";
}

//Even though the constant is created within the function, it's accessible anywhere
define_my_constant("PANDA", "I'll Bamboo You!");

echo PANDA; //Prints: I'll Bamboo You!

PANDA = "No, you won't"; //Will give a syntax ERROR - you can't change a constant
</pre>

<p>NOTE: Again, constants follow the same naming rules as variables and functions.</p>

<h2>References</h2>

<p>The only thing that is really tricky when it comes to scope, is applying it to references. We've seen that references are a great way to point one variable to another, and they are a great way to bridge the gap between scopes and code blocks. But there's good and bad things.</p>

<p><em>The Good</em>: You can pass a variable by reference to automatically make it act in the same scope. To do so, simply place the familiar ampersand ( <code>&amp;</code> ) in front of the parameter name.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//This works fine
function echo_user_count(&$count) {
	echo "There are $count users online at the moment";
}

$user_count = 10;
echo_user_count($user_count);
</pre>

<p><em>The Bad</em>: Say we declare a variable inside a function (local scope), and assign it a reference to a variable elsewhere (global scope). Well, when the function ends, the local variable would be removed, in which case the global variable would be removed as well. PHP doesn't want this happening, which means changing referenced variables in a function has <em>no</em> effect.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//This does not work fine. It doesn't give an error, it just does nothing.
function add_user() {
	$count = &$user_count;
	$count++;
}

$user_count = 10;
add_user($user_count);

echo $user_count; //Prints: 10

  title: "[PHP] Objects I"
  post: "<p>Finally, finally, finally we arrive at the big guns. The whole course has been building up to this moment, and now we can use all our knowledge to start performing some object magic.</p>

<p>I've briefly mentioned them a few times already, especially in relation with arrays and loops, but <em>what are objects</em>? Objects are, essentially, an intuitive and easy way of programming. Instead of using a lot of separate functions, we can group together related information inside one object---just as in the real world. If you want work with multiple blog posts (with lots of metadata attached to them), turn every blog post into a single object. If you want to create collectible items for a browser game, turn every item into an object.</p>

<p><em>What's the difference with arrays</em>? For starters, objects can store key-value pairs as well as functions. Additionally, objects can inherit from or extend other objects---so, for example, you could use one "master object" to hold all the data that all objects will have in common.</p>

<img src="media/PHPObjectsClasses.png" />

<h2>Classes</h2>

<p>Remember this: an object is a single, specific instance of a certain <strong>class</strong>. Within PHP, you must first define a class, and once that's done you can instance as many objects of that class as you want. Think of classes as blueprints for objects---within them you can define what you want a certain class of objects to look like, but nothing is actually created until you create a new object of that type.</p>

<p>To create a new class, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">class SomeClass {
	<em>code</em>
}</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
class User {
	//code that provides all sorts of information about this User
}
</pre>

<p>It's a custom to write classes with capital letters starting each word. This is to make sure you can easily see the difference between creating an object and calling a function later on.</p>

<p>NOTE: Classes follow the same naming rules as variables.</p>

<h2>Creating Objects</h2>

<p>To create a new object from an already defined class, use the <code>new</code> keyword:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$var = new SomeClass();</code>

<p>I think the fact that you need to use the <em>new</em> word is a good reminder of how objects work; every object you create is unique, even though it shares the same class with other objects. Two cars might be exactly the same, but it's still two separate cars.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
class User {
	//code that provides all sorts of information about this User
}

//$user_1 and $user_2 are two seperate objects, instantiated from the same class
$user_1 = new User();
$user_2 = new User();
</pre>

<h2>Defining Properties &amp; Methods</h2>

<p>As I said, objects can contain key-value pairs and functions. In the case of objects, we call them <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>methods</strong> instead. (This is to differentiate it from regular variables and functions.)</p>

<p>To create a <em>property</em>, one simply defines a variable within the class definition. It's important to note, though, that you can only assign values to the variable---expressions are not allowed. To create a <em>method</em>, one simply defines a function within the class definition.</p>

<p>PHP, however, requires you to say something about the <em>visibility</em> of the properties and methods. For safety reasons, we sometimes don't want other parts of the code lurking around in our properties. We have three keywords for that:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>public</code>: the property/method is accessible from anywhere</li>
	<li><code>protected</code>: the property/method is accessible only from within the class itself and inherited classes</li>
	<li><code>private</code>: the property/method is accessible only from within the class itself</li>
</ul>

<pre data-lang="php">
/* The user has three properties (username, favrite pet, and password)
   The user has one method (that prints a message) */
class User {
	public $username = "Ginty";
	public $favorite_pet = "Rabbits";
	private $password = "gintyisawesomeyeah";

	public function print_message() {
		echo "Hey there, I am Ginty!";
	}
}
</pre>

<p>NOTE: You can also define constants with the familiar <code>const</code> keyword. These are automatically public and need no visibility keyword in front of them.</p>

<h2>Accessing Properties &amp; Methods</h2>

<p>To access a property or method, we use the <em>arrow syntax</em> ( <code>-></code> ):</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$some_object->property;
$some_object->method();</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
class User {
	public $username = "Ginty";
	public $favorite_pet = "Rabbits";
	private $password = "gintyisawesomeyeah";

	public function print_message() {
		echo "Hey there, I am Ginty!";
	}
}

$user = new User();
echo $user->username; //Prints: Ginty
echo $user->password; //Prints: ERROR cannot access private property 

$user->print_message(); //Prints: Hey there, I am Ginty!
</pre>

<p>NOTE: Leave out the dollar sign when accessing a property. If you do include the dollar sign, PHP will use the <em>value</em> of that variable to access a property.</p>

<h2>The $this Pseudo-variable</h2>

<p>The arrow syntax I just introduced isn't just for accessing properties/methods from outside of the object---it's also the only way to access one from within the object. However, how do we access the current object from within the class definition? I mean, is there any way we could access the current object that we're in? Well, we can do so using the <code>$this</code> pseudo-variable!</p>

<p>This variable can be used in a class definition to reference the current object, and therefore allows us to access its own properties and methods. You're going to need it a lot.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
class User {
	public $username = "Juan";
	public $favorite_pet = "Rabbits";
	private $password = "juanisawesomeyeah";

	//Returns true only if $password and $pwd match
	public function check_password($pwd) {
		return ($this->password === $pwd) ? true : false;
	}

	public function print_message() {
		echo "Hey, I am $this->username, and I like $this->favorite_pet.";
	}
}

$user = new User();

$is_password_correct = $user->check_password("juanisawesomeyeah"); //Returns true

$user->print_message(); //Prints: Hey I am Juan, and I like rabbits.

/* As you can see, we can't access the password directly, but we can check if the password we entered is correct (which is more secure than if anyone were to just get the password) */
</pre>

<p>NOTE: I call it a pseudo-variable, as it is a variable---but we can't change it ourselves. It automatically adapts itself to the object in which we're currently executing a function.</p>

<h2>Object Operators</h2>

<p>Because objects are so complex, they only allow two operators:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Operator</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>==</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if both objects have the same properties/methods and values, and are instances of the same class.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>===</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if both objects refer to the exact same instance of the same class.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>How the second (strict) operator works has everything to do with how objects are assigned and copied, which next section is about.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
class User {
	public $username = "Juan";
	public $favorite_pet = "Tree Kangaroos";
}

$user_1 = new User();
$user_2 = new User();

var_dump($user_1 == $user_2);  //Prints: bool(true)
var_dump($user_1 === $user_2); //Prints: bool(false)
</pre>

<h2>Object Assignment</h2>

<p>With all the other data types, if you assign one variable to another, the value is simply <em>copied</em>. If you wanted to avoid that, you could use a <em>reference</em> to make two variables identical.</p>

<p>With objects, it works a little differently. If you assign a variable containing an object to a new variable, an address <em>pointing</em> to the object is passed on. This means that both variables will point to the same object and both will edit the same object. But, it's not a reference, as changing one variable will <em>not</em> automatically update the other. So, it's a middle-ground between copying and referencing.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
class User {
	public $username = "Juan";
	public $favorite_pet = "Tree Kangaroos";
}

$user_1 = new User();
$user_2 = $user_1;

$user_2->username = "HE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED";

//Both $user_1 and $user_2 are now exactly the same object
var_dump($user_1);
var_dump($user_2);
/* Both print
	object(User)#1 (2) {
	  ["username"]=>
	  	string(24) "HE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED"
	  ["favorite_pet"]=>
	  	string(14) "Tree Kangaroos"
	}
*/

$user_2 = 0;

//Now $user_1 will contain the original object, but $user_2 is 0. If it were a reference, $user_1 and $user_2 should both have been 0 by now. But objects are not passed by reference.
</pre>

<p><em>But, what do I do if I actually want to copy the object?</em> Well, because objects are supposed to be unique, we call it <strong>cloning</strong>. To do so, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$var = clone $obj;</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
class User {
	public $username = "Juan";
	public $favorite_pet = "Tree Kangaroos";
}

$user_1 = new User();
$user_2 = clone $user_1;

var_dump($user_1);
var_dump($user_2);
/* Prints
	object(User)#1 (2) {
	  ["username"]=>
	  	string(4) "Juan"
	  ["favorite_pet"]=>
	  	string(14) "Tree Kangaroos"
	}
	
	object(User)#2 (2) {
	  ["username"]=>
	  	string(4) "Juan"
	  ["favorite_pet"]=>
	  	string(14) "Tree Kangaroos"
	}
*/
</pre>

<h2>Object Iteration</h2>

<p>We've already seen (in the <em>Loops</em> chapter) that you must use the <code>foreach</code> loop to iterate through all the properties and methods of an object. But, there's a subtle difference to be aware of---it will only loop through all the <em>visible</em> elements.</p>

<p>So, if the loop is somewhere outside of the class, it will only go through all the <em>public</em> properties. But, if it's inside the class definition, it will go through <em>all</em> properties.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
class User {
	public $username = "Juan";
	public $favorite_pet = "Tree Kangaroos";
	private $password = "treesareawesomeyeah";

	public function iterate() {
		foreach($this as $value) {
			echo $value . " | ";
		}
	}
}

$user = new User();

//This prints: Juan | Tree Kangaroos |
foreach($user as $value) {
	echo $value . " | ";
}

//This prints: Juan | Tree Kangaroos | treesareawesomeyeah |
$user->iterate();

  title: "[PHP] Objects II"
  post: "<p>Now that we know how to create objects from our template class, all we really need to do is upgrade the template class to achieve more complex or sophisticated objects.</p>

<h2>Auto-loading</h2>

<p>As a project grows in size (as it often does), you're going to be working with lots of classes. It's a custom, therefore, to put every class into its own separate PHP file. So, for example, the class <em>User</em> is put in the file <em>User.php</em>. This way you can easily keep track of all classes, and simply <code>include</code> all the classes you're going to need at the top of a file.</p>

<p>But, it's a lot of hard work to copy around these includes from file to file, which is why PHP allows you to auto-load all your classes. To do so, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">spl_autoload_register(function($name) {
	include <em><find correct file using $name></em>;
});</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Say we have classes saved inside the files User.php, Comment.php, BlogPost.php
spl_autoload_register(function($name) {
	include "$name.php";
});

//The autoload will automatically load the User.php file when we try to create an object from it.
$user = new User();

//The other two files are not loaded, as we don't need them. Saves time!
</pre>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>

<p>One of the best things about objects and classes, is that you can use <em>inheritance</em>. This means that you can create a class that is a child of another class (a "subclass"), and therefore automatically inherits all the properties and methods of its parent. Using this, you can create huge classes that contain some general functionality and variables, and then create subclasses that automatically inherit this general functionality and add their own special bag of tricks.</p>

<p>To create a subclass, simply <em>extend</em> another class:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">class SomeSubClass extends SomeParentClass</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
class Product {
	public $price = 10;
	public $manufacturer = "LEGO";
	public $reviews = 9.6;
}

//A product on sale extends the general product class, and adds a discount
class SaleProduct extends Product {
	public $discount = 0.8;
}

$new_item = new SaleProduct();
echo "The final price is " . ($new_item->discount * $new_item->price) . " euros.";

//Prints: The final price is 8 euros.
</pre>

<p>NOTE: The parent class must be defined first in the file, otherwise PHP doesn't know what to extend.</p>

<h2>Traits</h2>

<p>Instead of inheriting from complete classes, we can also just save a bunch of methods and properties under a certain name, and copy this code around inside other classes. In other words, we let multiple classes share the same <em>traits</em>. To create a trait, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">trait SomeTraitName { <em>code</em> }</code>

<p>To include or <em>use</em> it inside some other class, use (not surprisingly)</p>

<code class="longsyntax">use SomeTraitName;</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
class Product {
	public $price = 10;
	public $manufacturer = "LEGO";
	public $reviews = 9.6;
}

trait Discount {
	public $discount = 0.8;
	function calculate_price() {
		return ($this->discount * $this->price);
	}
} 

class SaleProduct extends Product {
	use Discount;
}

$new_item = new SaleProduct();
echo "The final price is " . $new_item->calculate_price() . " euros.";

//Prints: The final price is 8 euros.
</pre>

<h2>Abstract Classes</h2>

<p>Remember when I told you about the huge classes and the subclasses? (You should, I <em>just</em> told you.) Well, in most cases, you aren't going to create an object from the huge class---you'll only be creating objects from the subclasses.</p>

<p>For example, you could have a general class called "vehicle", and lots of smaller classes called "car" and "truck" that extend this general class. If you were to attach functions to the vehicle class such as "accelerate" and "brake", all vehicles would inherit this functionality and add their own functionality (such as colour or maximum speed). Now, you can instantiate lots of car and truck objects, but you will never create an object from the vehicle class as it is too general.</p>

<p>In these cases, it's best to make that vehicle class an <em>abstract class</em>. To do so, simply use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">abstract class SomeAbstractClass { <em>code</em> }</code>

<p>You can't instantiate such a class, but you can <em>extend</em> it. Additionally, you can use the <code>abstract</code> keyword in front of methods and properties to force the extending class to define it. (This is useful if subclasses share the same method name but with slightly different functionality.)</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//An abstract Item class that contains no real information (it's too general)
abstract class Item {
	abstract public $price;
	abstract public $item_id;
}

//A specific LegoItem class that is forced to define the price and item_id properties. In addition, it adds some more information to help the customer.
class LegoItem extends Item {
	public $price = 250;
	public $manufacturer = "LEGO";
	public $item_id = 1234
	public $description = "LEGO is fun for all ages! Buy it now, or buy something else. As long as you buy from our webshop.";
}
</pre>

<h2>Anonymous Classes</h2>

<p>Lastly, if you only need a simple, one-off object, you can use an anonymous class to create it. This simply means that, instead of placing a call to an existing class after the <code>new</code> keyword, you simply type the whole class definition.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$object = new class { public $username = "Ginty"; public $dating_profile = "Looking for a man that likes to dance."; };

echo $object->username; //Prints Ginty, as expected.
</pre>

<h2>Constructors &amp; Destructors</h2>

<p>Constructors are very important, as they are what make every object truly unique. For example, say we're making an online chatroom, and we create an object for every user that is currently logged in. This object would then be instantiated from the User class, which means every user would be identical---but they're not, so how do we fix that by giving every object its own ID or username? <strong>Constructors</strong>.</p>

<p>Just after PHP has created a new object, it automatically makes a call to the <code>__construct()</code> method on that object. If you haven't defined it, no worries, PHP just goes on with its life.</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> define it, you can use that method to construct the object and tweak its settings. Moreover, did you ever wonder why we need parentheses after the class name when instantiating a new object (like <code>new Class()</code>)? Well, it's because we can pass arguments to that constructor method, just like with any function!</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
class User { 
	public $username; 
	public $favorite_movie;

    //BEHOLD THE POWER OF THE CONSTRUCTOR
	function __construct($usn, $movie) {
		$this->username = $usn;
		$this->favorite_movie = $movie;
	}
};

$user_1 = new User("Juan", "Inception"); //Creates a User object, and sets username and movie
echo $user_1->username; //Prints: Juan


$user_2 = new User("BATMAN", "The Dark Knight. Duh.");
echo $user_2->favorite_movie; //Prints: The Dark Knight. Duh.;
</pre>

<p>On the other hand, PHP also automatically calls the <code>__destruct()</code> method when an object is deleted. There's some subtlety involved here; an object is deleted only if all references to it are gone. So, if two variables hold the reference to the same object, they <em>both</em> need to be deleted in order to delete the object.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
class User { 
	public $username; 
	
	function __construct($usn) {
		$this->username = $usn;
	}

    //BEHOLD THE MIGHTY DESTRUCTOR
	function __destruct() {
		echo "User $this->username has been removed from chat.";
	}
};

$user_1 = new User("Juan");
unset($user_1);

//Prints: User Juan has been removed from chat.
</pre>

<h2>Magic Methods</h2>

<p>The methods from last section aren't the only ones that are automatically called by PHP on some occasions---they are part of a larger group called the <strong>magic methods</strong>. All magic methods start with those two underscores ( <code>__</code> ). (Which means that you shouldn't use it for non-magic methods.)</p>

<p>Here's a nice overview of all the other magic methods (although, the constructor is by far the most important):</p>

<table>

			</td>

			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>__debugInfo()</code></p>
			</td>

  title: "[PHP] Superglobals"
  post: "<p>We have, so far, been fairly on the PHP side of things---create all sorts of variables and functions, and do stuff with them. However, how do we relate this to HTML and the user? How do we send input from HTML to the server? How do we retrieve data from the server and do something with it in the HTML? How do we create and upload files?</p>

<p>These questions won't get a definitive answer in this chapter, as it will take much more time than that to explain it, but we will start with something that lies at the basis of all of them: <strong>superglobals</strong>.</p>

<p>Superglobals are variables (usually associative arrays) that can be accessed from <em>anywhere</em> within the program, and which are automatically set by PHP to the right value. For example, a superglobal could contain the current URL of the page you're on.</p>

<p>There's 8 superglobal variables available (and you've already seen the first one):</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>$GLOBALS</code></li>
	<li><code>$_SERVER</code></li>
	<li><code>$_POST</code></li>
	<li><code>$_GET</code></li>
	<li><code>$_FILES</code></li>
	<li><code>$_ENV</code></li>
	<li><code>$_COOKIE</code></li>
	<li><code>$_SESSION</code></li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, superglobals have uppercase names starting with <code>$_</code>. I recommend you keep this naming system for the superglobals, and don't use it on your own variables, to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>As you can also see, there's a lot of them with lots of different things they can do---and all of it's important. Therefore, I will cover the simpler superglobals in this chapter, and the others subsequently in their own chapters. If you want to know <em>all</em> the things you can do with a superglobal, check the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php">PHP Manual</a></p>

<h2>$_SERVER</h2>

<p>This superglobal contains information about the server---more specifically, the host you're on, its settings, and the filename you're currently accessing. Its most important keys are:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Key</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>PHP_SELF</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The <em>relative</em> path to the current file</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>SCRIPT_NAME</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The <em>absolute</em> path to the current file</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>SERVER_ADDR</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The IP address of the server</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>SERVER_NAME</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The name of the server</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>REMOTE_ADDR</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The IP address of the user accessing the page</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>REQUEST_URI</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The URL used to access the page</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="php">
$get_url = $_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"];

//If we're on the article page of our blog...
if($get_url == '/blogArticles.php') {
	//...display the article
} else {
	//...display the homepage
}
</pre>

<h2>$_ENV</h2>

<p>This superglobal is used for managing <em>environmental variables</em>. These are simply variables that are only available within a certain environment. Which data it holds, however, depends on the server and of course environment, which means I won't say anything more about it.</p>

<p>It can also be used to pass variables between files, but I recommend using the <code>$_SESSION</code> superglobal for that, which is discussed in the <em>Cookies &amp; Sessions</em> chapter.</p>

<h2>Magic Constants</h2>

<p>A slightly downplayed version of the superglobals, are the <strong>magic constants</strong>. They are the regular constants that you're used to, with one difference: PHP changes their value based on where you call the constant from. They are constants, but they're not necessarily constant. Magic, right?</p>

<p>So, instead of being a superglobal <em>variable</em>, they are superglobal <em>constants</em> that you can access, but automatically change for you. For example, one of the magic constants contains the current line number that is being executed when you call it. They are usually used together with superglobals, but they can also stand on their own.</p>

<p>The 8 magical constants are:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Magic Constant</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>__LINE__</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The current line number of the current file</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>__FILE__</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The full path and filename of the current file</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>__DIR__</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The directory of the current file.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>__FUNCTION__</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The function that's currently being executed</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>

  title: "[PHP] Forms & Dynamic Pages"
  post: "<p>The only way to let the user send data to a server (such as login information or a search query) is by using forms. Sometimes these forms may be disguised as something else---such as a zone where you can drop files to upload them---but in the end they will always work like a form.</p>

<p>And if you remember from learning HTML, forms have two methods for sending data: <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>. (You can set this on a form by setting the <code>method="GET"</code> or <code>method="POST"</code> attribute.)</p>

<p>Both methods are a way of sending extra data towards a file you're requesting from the server---basically, it's a way to use <em>cross-file variables</em>. For example, when I login with my username and password, I am sending the input as two variables towards another page that checks whether they are correct and then logs me in. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and you'll typically use them in different situations.</p>

<img src="media/PHPGETvsPOST.png" />

<h2>$_GET</h2>

<p>You've probably come across URLs that look something like</p>

<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><em>file.php?id=blabla&amp;name=vlavla</em></p>

<p>Even though it may look odd, there's nothing wrong about it. The question mark behind the file name ( <code>?</code> ) signals PHP that there's some variables to come. Each variable is passed using <code>name=value</code>, and every subsequent variable definition separated by an ampersand ( <code>&amp;</code> ).</p>

<p>This way, we can pass as many values as we want to another file. The great thing is, though, that this is just a URL you can access. So, we can let a form pass that data for us, or we can just provide links to URLs with the variables attached.</p>

<p>For example, we could create an anchor tag with the <code>href</code> attribute set to <code>"file.php?id=blabla"</code>, to create a link that automatically goes to the file <em>file.php</em> and passes along the <em>blabla</em> value.</p>

<p>The <code>$_GET</code> superglobal works by "getting" these variables from the URL. To do so, simply use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$_GET["variablename"];</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Say we're accessing the URL item.php?id=25&name=LEGO

echo $_GET['id'];   //Prints 25
echo $_GET['name']; //Prints LEGO
//Using this information, we can load the information on the right product and display it to the user
</pre>

<p>This method is typically used for dynamic pages. For example, every tutorial on this website is loaded by a single file! All I have to do is pass the right ID to the file using the syntax described above, get the value of that variable from within the file, and use that to load the right information from my database. I don't have to create a separate file for every tutorial. (Which would, frankly, be a very, very bad thing to do.)</p>

<p>NOTE: The reason you're not seeing any of this in your browser bar is because I'm rewriting my URLs using Mod Rewrite. But that's beyond the scope of this tutorial.</p>

<h2>$_POST</h2>

<p>Alternatively, you can pass variables to a file without making the URLs look ridiculous. Additionally, the <em>POST</em> method is safer to use, as users can't see or temper with the data being passed on. This may seem like it's always the better option, but the downside is that you can only use them with forms. Essentially, you can remember that the form "<em>posts</em>" the variables to the other page.</p>

<p><em>How does PHP know which variables to post?</em> PHP posts all variables within a form that have the <code>name</code> attribute set. This means that you can't have colliding names, or PHP wouldn't know which one to send.</p>

<p>To access a cross-file variable using the <code>$_POST</code> superglobal, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$_POST["variablename"];</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Say we're accessing the URL login.php, with variable username and password posted to it

if($_POST['username'] === "Juan" && $_POST['password'] === "1234") {
	//sign in the user
} else {
	//tell the user the username/password is incorrect
}
</pre>

<h2>A Simple Form</h2>

<p>Here's a simple form to show you how superglobals and HTML come together.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Code from the home page
<form method="POST" action="actionPage.php">
  <input name="usn" type="text" placeholder="username" />
  <input name="pwd" type="text" placeholder="password" />
  <input type="submit" value="Log in!" />
</form>

//Code from actionPage.php
<?php
  $administrators = ["Juan", "Johnny", "Don Juan"];
  $admin_passwords = ["1234", "5678", "90"];

  $username_correct = array_search($_POST['usn'], $administrators);

  //If the username exists...
  if($username_correct != false) {
    //...and the corresponding password is correct as well...
    if($admin_passwords[$username_correct] == $_POST['pwd']) {
      //Log him in!
    }
  }
?>
</pre>

<h2>Some Additional Notes</h2>

<p>Passing data between files can be a tricky business, especially if that data is sensitive. The number one rule to PHP security is to <em>never pass sensitive data using the GET method</em>.</p>

<p>Besides that, however, there are numerous ways that a user can (consciously or not) play with your system by trying to input stuff you didn't expect. If you're going to use the variables in a harmless way, there's no reason to worry much about security.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you're working with user information or interacting with your server, there's surely going to be hackers trying to get access to your server. And you don't want that.</p>

<p>The first thing you usually want to do is make sure those cross-file variables are actually set, and set to the right type. This is normally done with <code>isset()</code>.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//If no username or no password is set
if(!isset($_POST['usn']) || !isset($POST['pwd'])) {
	//return to the homepage with an error
}
</pre>

<p>Then, you could use string operations to cut out any words or characters you don't want. There are better ways, however, and I will explain much more about internet security in the <strong><em>Advanced PHP</em></strong> course.</p>

<p>My last note is about another superglobal I intentionally didn't mention: <code>$_REQUEST</code>. It holds both the <em>GET</em> and <em>POST</em> variables. I don't think you should ever use it, as it's just redundant and unsafe. Nevertheless, I wanted you to know it's out there in case you ever encounter it in the wild.</p>

  title: "[PHP] Files I"
  post: "<p>Everything on a server is a file. The PHP programs we've been executing all the time are files, images are files, CSS stylesheets are files, and so on. So, it's not unreasonable to expect that PHP might have to deal with other files at some time. A typical use case is, for example, uploading files to a server, or displaying the contents of a text file.</p>

<p>I must warn you though. Just as with dynamic pages, users can (accidentally or not) do things with files you don't want. Because files are actually stored on a server, and therefore somewhat permanent, you should make sure they don't get extremely large and don't get erased. That said, let's start looking at files.</p>

<h2>File Creation/Opening</h2>

<p>Before we can start doing anything with a file, we need to <em>open</em> it. This is done with</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$file = fopen("path/to/file.ext", permissions);</code>

<p>The <em>permissions</em> parameter is a string that determines what we intend to do with the file (read the contents, overwrite it, etcetera). More on that in next section.</p>

<p><em>What if the file doesn't exist?</em> Fortunately, PHP is a real go-getter. If it can't find the file you're looking for, it <strong>creates</strong> the file for you, and then opens it! This is only the case, however, if you've set the permissions to anything but reading the file.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//This opens the file user_settings.txt for reading its contents
$file = fopen("user_settings.txt", "r");
</pre>

<h2>Permissions</h2>

<p>As promised, here's a table of all the permissions we can give ourselves for a file:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Type</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Symbol</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Read</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>"r"</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Only read the contents of a file, from the start.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Write</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>"w"</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Erase all data, and start writing in the file from the start. (This is also called <em>overwriting</em>.)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Append</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>"a"</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Write data to a file, from the end. (So it doesn't overwrite anything.)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Read/Write</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>"r+"</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Allows you to read and write into a file (a combination of <em>r</em> and <em>a</em>), from the start</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Write/Read</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>"w+"</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Allows you to read and overwrite a file (a combination of <em>r </em>and <em>w</em>)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Read/Append</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>"a+"</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Allows you to read and write into a file (a combination of <em>r </em>and <em>a</em>), from the end.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="php">
//This opens the file user_settings.txt and erases all contents
$file = fopen("user_settings.txt", "w");

//This simply opens the file user_settings.txt, and will let you append extra information at the end
$file = fopen("user_settings.txt", "a");

//If the file user_settings.txt didn't exist, both would first create the file and then open it
</pre>

<h2>Reading</h2>

<p>There's two ways of reading from a file: <em>load a certain amount of characters once</em> or <em>line by line</em>.</p>

<p>The syntax for the first method is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">fread($file, length);</code>

<p>The <em>file</em> parameter always points to an opened file, whilst the <em>length</em> parameter specifies the amount of characters to load. If you want to load all the characters within the file, simply set the length to:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">filesize("path/to/file.ext");</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
/* Content of user_settings.txt:
	maximum_upload_size=10;maximum_download_size=100;
*/

$file = fopen("user_settings.txt", "r");
echo fread($file, filesize("user_settings.txt"));

//Prints: maximum_upload_size=10;maximum_download_size=100;
</pre>

<p>The syntax for the second method is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">fget($file);</code>

<p>The first time you call it, this gets you the first line of the file. The second time you call it, it returns the second line, and so on.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
/* Content of user_settings.txt:
	maximum_upload_size=10;
	maximum_download_size=100;
*/

$file = fopen("user_settings.txt", "r");
echo fget($file); //Prints maximum_upload_size=10;
echo fget($file); //Prints maximum_download_size=100;
</pre>

<h2>Writing/Appending</h2>

<p>To write into a file, all you have to do is use a single function</p>

<code class="longsyntax">fwrite($file, $new_data);</code>

<p>This works for both the <code>w</code> and <code>a</code> permissions, as both write into a file, but the first one just erases the content before it starts writing.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
/* Content of user_settings.txt:
	maximum_upload_size=10;\\n
*/

$file = fopen("user_settings.txt", "a");
fwrite($file, "maximum_download_size=100;"); 
/* Now user_settings.txt contains:
	  maximum_upload_size=10;
	  maximum_download_size=100;
*/

$file = fopen("user_settings.txt", "w");
fwrite($file, "THE USER SETTINGS HAVE BEEN HACKED"); 
/* Now user_settings.txt contains: 
	  THE USER SETTINGS HAVE BEEN HACKED
*/
</pre>

<p>NOTE: If all you want to do is erase a file, without writing in it, you can of course just open the file using the <strong>w</strong> permission and don't write anything in it. This is called <em>truncating</em>.</p>

<h2>Deleting</h2>

<p>If you want to delete a file, you don't have to open it first. You can make it vanish with</p>

<code class="longsyntax">unlink("path/to/file.ext");</code>

<p>NOTE: Of course, when using the unlink function somewhere, always make sure you are deleting the right file.</p>

<h2>Closing</h2>

<p>When you're done playing with a file, you should always close it. This is to prevent security issues, save memory, and make sure you're always opening the right file before writing/reading. To do so, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">fclose($file);</code>

<h2>File Functions</h2>

<p>As stated earlier, file security is a big thing. Before you do any dangerous file operation, you often want to check if the file you're looking for is already there or not, whether the type of file is correct, and whether you even have permission to change the file. For this, we have several file functions, which will also play a big role in next chapter.</p>

<p>To check if a file has a certain property, you can use the following functions.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Function</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>is_file(<em>path</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the path leads to a file, false if it's a directory or doesn't exist.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>is_readable(<em>path</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true you have permissions to read the file</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>is_writeable(<em>path</em>)</code><br />
			<code>is_writable(<em>path</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if you have permissions to write to the file</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>is_uploaded_file(<em>path</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if a file has been uploaded by the script</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>is_executable(<em>path</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the file is executable</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>is_dir(<em>path</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the path is a directory, false if it's a file or doesn't exist.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="php">
//If a settings file exists...
if(is_file("user_settings.txt")) {
	//...update some of the settings
} else {
	//...if not, tell the user something went wrong
}
</pre>

<p>To get specific information about a certain file, use</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Function</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>filesize(<em>path</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns the size of the file ( = the amount of bytes/characters)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>file_exists(<em>path</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the file exists, false otherwise.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>filetype(<em>path</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns the type; file or directory</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>basename(<em>path</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns the last element of the path (which is usually the current file or directory you're in).</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="php">
if(filetype($user_uploaded_file) == "image/png") {
	//it's an image, upload it to our images folder
} else {
	//abort mission, the user tricked us!
}
</pre>

<h2>Shorthand Functions</h2>

<p>Lastly, if you're planning on reading/writing a file only once, there are easier ways to do so (instead of having to open and close it every time).</p>

<p>To read a file and automatically put all the lines of a file inside an array, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$arr = file(path);</code>

<p>To get all the characters between position offset and (offset + maxlen), use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">file_get_contents(path [, false, null, $offset, $maxlen]);</code>

<p>To write data to a file, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">file_put_contents(path, $data);</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
//If new data arrives...
if($new_data) {
	//...immediately write it into the data.txt file
	file_put_contents("data.txt", $new_data);
}
</pre>

<p>NOTE: I've glossed over lots of functions and optional parameters here, but they don't make sense until you are reading the <strong><em>Advanced PHP</em></strong> course, so you can find them there!</p>

  title: "[PHP] Files II"
  post: "<p>Last chapter discussed pretty elementary file operations---creating, reading, writing, deleting. In this chapter, we'll be putting those to good use by looking at <em>downloading</em>, <em>uploading</em>, and<em> directories</em> (and all functions that come with it). This is also the moment we get to see the <code>$_FILES</code> superglobal in action.</p>

<h2>Downloading</h2>

<p>Some file types (such as <code>.zip</code>) are automatically downloaded by the browser, but most are just opened or ignored. This isn't very useful, especially when downloading is a big deal for your website (e.g., if you're running an online file service or want to allow users to download something they created in your web app). It would therefore be nice if we could force PHP to download a file, and as you might have expected, we can!</p>

<p>The trick is to not go to the file's URL, but instead use a PHP script to fetch the file and push it to the browser. For this, we have the function</p>

<code class="longsyntax">readfile("path/to/file.ext");</code>

<p>But, simply reading the file isn't enough---as we've seen in last chapter, that alone doesn't download anything. So, we need to tell the browser that we want the data to be treated as a file to be downloaded, and to do so we use <strong>headers</strong>. For now I'll just show you how to use them without an in-depth explanation, but be sure to check out all the cool stuff you can do with them once you feel like it.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
$file = 'awesomeImage.png';

//If the image exists...
if (file_exists($file)) {
	//...force the browser to download it instead of display it
    header('Content-Description: File Transfer');
    header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream');
    header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="'.basename($file).'"');
    header('Expires: 0');
    header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate');
    header('Pragma: public');
    header('Content-Length: ' . filesize($file));

    //...and actually request the file and download it
    readfile($file);
    exit;
}
</pre>

<h2>Uploading</h2>

<p>To upload files we need to use forms, again. HTML has a special element that allows you to select a file, and by using the POST method, we can give this file to PHP to upload it.</p>

<img src="media/PHPUploadingFiles.png" />

<p>A simple form that allows uploading looks like this:</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<form method="POST" formenctype="multipart/form-data" action="uploadPage.php">
  <input type="file" name="file" />
  <input type="submit" value="Upload!" />
</form>
</pre>

<p>When you submit the form, PHP automatically uploads the file under a temporary name to a temporary directory. It's your job to check if the file fits your requirements, and then move it to where you want.</p>

<p>All the information related to file uploads is saved in the <code>$_FILES</code> superglobal. Just as with the <em>GET </em>and <em>POST</em> method, you can access the file by name with</p>
<code class="longsyntax">$_FILES["name"]</code>

<p>This returns another array with these 5 properties:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Syntax</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>name</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Path to the original file</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>tmp_name</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Path to the temporary file on the server</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>type</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The type of the file (image/jpeg, image/png, and so on)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>size</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The size of the file (in bytes)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>error</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>An error code. If this is 0, everything went fine. If it's not, something went wrong during the uploading process.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Say we need to check whether the upload was an image, and whether its size isn't too large
if($_FILES["file"]["type"] == "image/jpeg" || $_FILES["file"]["type"] == "image/png") {
	if($_FILES["file"]["size"] <= 1024) {
		//the file is good!
	} else {
		echo "Sorry, the file is too large";
	}
} else {
	echo "Sorry, the file is not an image";
}
</pre>

<p>Knowing this, we have to take one last step: moving the temporary file to the place we want it to be. From that moment on, it will permanently stay there unless we move it again. To do so, use:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">move_uploaded_file($tmp_file, $target_file);</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
$upload_dir = "/images";

if($_FILES["file"]["type"] == "image/jpeg") {
	if($_FILES["file"]["size"] <= 1024) {
		//The file is good, save it permanently
		$temporary_name = $_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"];
		$original_name = $_FILES["file"]["name"]
		move_uploaded_file($temporary_name, "$upload_dir/$original_name");
	}
}
</pre>

<h2>Directories</h2>

<p>Once a file is on a server, the story of course doesn't end there. We can dynamically add and remove directories, rename files, or copy them around. For example, a website that allows photo storage could allow you to create "albums" to which to upload your photos. Then, for every album a user creates, it simply creates a new folder on the server with the name you've chosen, and this way the billions of photos on the website's server stay neatly organized.</p>

<p>To make a new directory, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">mkdir($pathname [, $mode = 0777, $recursive = false]);</code>

<p>The default <em>$mode</em> allows the widest possible access---you can both read, write and execute the directory. (Read more on <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.chmod.php">chmod</a>.) The <em>$recursive</em> parameter, if set to true, can create multiple nested directories at once if you specify them in the <em>$pathname</em>.</p>

<p>To remove an existing directory, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">rmdir($dirname);</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
// Desired folder structure
$folders = '/images/Ginty/FamilyPhotos/';

if (mkdir($folders, 0777, true)) {
	echo "Succesfully created folders!";
} else {
	echo "Folder creation failed :(";
}
</pre>

<h2>Renaming</h2>

<p>To rename a file or directory, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">rename($oldname, $newname);</code>

<p>Note that this function allows you to input paths, which means it also allows you to move the file to somewhere else.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
// User requested to change the album name to OldFamilyPhotos
rename("/images/Ginty/FamilyPhotos", "/images/Ginty/OldFamilyPhotos");
</pre>

<h2>Copying</h2>

<p>To copy a file or directory, use:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">copy($source, $destination);</code>

<p>Again, the file can be copied to any other place. If the file is copied to a place where there's already another file with the same name, that old file is overwritten.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
// Juan, Ginty's Husband, requested a copy of the family photos for himself as well
copy("/images/Ginty/OldFamilyPhotos", "/images/Juan/OldFamilyPhotos");
</pre>

<h2>Path Information</h2>

<p>To get the path to the <em>parent directory</em> of a certain file/directory, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">dirname($path [, $levels]);</code>

<p>The <em>$levels</em> parameter specifies how many levels to go upwards. The default value is 1, which means it access the direct parent. A value of 2, for example, would access the parent of the parent.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
echo dirname("/images/Ginty/OldFamilyPhotos/IMG_0002.png"); //Prints OldFamilyPhotos
echo dirname("/images/Ginty/OldFamilyPhotos/IMG_0002.png", 3); //Prints images
</pre>

<p>To access lots of different information about a path, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">pathinfo($path [, $options]);</code>

<p>The <em>$options</em> parameter can have one of four values:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>PATHINFO_DIRNAME</code>: Returns the parent directory</li>
	<li><code>PATHINFO_BASENAME</code>: Returns the last element (directory or file) of the path</li>
	<li><code>PATHINFO_EXTENSION</code>: Returns the extension of the last file of the path</li>
	<li><code>PATHINFO_FILENAME</code>: Returns the name of the last file of the path</li>
</ul>

<p>If it isn't set, the function returns all elements.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
echo pathinfo("/images/Ginty/OldFamilyPhotos/IMG_0002.png", PATHINFO_BASENAME); //Prints IMG_0002.png

  title: "[PHP] Cookies & Sessions"
  post: "<p>If you thought the other superglobals were all-powerful and extremely useful, you're in for a treat. The two topics of this chapter, cookies and sessions, can be viewed as <em>ultra-superglobals</em>. They aren't just available within the complete program, they are also available <em>across all files</em>.</p>

<h2>What are cookies?</h2>

<p>I'm sure you've seen cookie notifications or at least heard about them before. <strong>Cookies</strong> are everywhere, and they are used to save information within a user's web browser. A website can simply tell the browser to store certain data, under a certain name, for a certain amount of time.</p>

<p><em>Why are they called cookies</em>? Well, let's look at an example. Say you're running a an online store, which lets users place items they like into their "shopping cart", and at the end of the day pay for all products inside the cart at once. The way most sites do this, is by creating cookies that hold the items you've selected thus far. So, essentially, as you're browsing the site, the website's placing <em>cookie crumbs</em> along the path you're taking.</p>

<h2>Creating Cookies</h2>

<p>To create a cookie, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">setcookie("name", $value [, $expiration_date});</code>

<p>The <em>expiration_date </em>parameter determines how long the cookie will be kept by the browser. If set to 0 or omitted, the cookie is removed when the browser closes. Otherwise, you can set it to expire at a specific date, which we'll discuss in the advanced course.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Sets a cookie that keeps the user logged in for a day, so that he doesn't have to sign in again every time.
setcookie("login", true, time()+60*60*24);
</pre>

<p>If you want to <strong>modify</strong> an existing cookie, all you have to do is call this function again, with the same <em>name</em>, but different parameters. Essentially, it overwrites the old cookie with the new one.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Everytime the user logs in, update the cookie again to last another day.
setcookie("login", true, time()+60*60*24);
</pre>

<p>Of course, some people don't like having stuff saved into their browser, no matter how tiny. Therefore, cookies can be disabled. To check if cookies are working, you can simply set a cookie, and then check if it was successful. This is done by checking whether the <code>$_COOKIE</code> superglobal holds any elements:</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
setcookie("login", true, time()+60*60*24);

if(count($COOKIE) > 0) {
	//Cookies are enabled, let's do this!
}
</pre>

<h2>Retrieving Cookies</h2>

<p>To retrieve a cookie's value, simply use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$_COOKIE["name"];</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
setcookie("login", true, time()+60*60*24);
setcookie("username", "Juan", time()+60*60*24);

if($_COOKIE['login']) {
	//user is logged in, display welcome message
	echo "Welcome dear $_COOKIE['username']!";
}
</pre>

<h2>Deleting cookies</h2>

<p>Because cookies are saved in the browser and across files, you can't use functions like <code>unset()</code> on it. Instead, you can simply overwrite the cookie to an expiration date in the past. The browser will set the cookie, check the data, see it should have already expired, and delete it.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//If the user logs out, remove the cookie
setcookie("login", false, time()-1);
</pre>

<h2>What are Sessions?</h2>

<p>The cookies we've just seen are on the <em>user-side</em> of an application. The very same cookie you set with PHP could also be created or edited by JavaScript, for example, or deleted right from the browser.</p>

<p>Sometimes---particularly, when working with sensitive information---we don't want that, and we want the <em>server-side</em> to keep track of certain variables for a particular user. For this we can use <strong>sessions</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, when a user starts a sign up process we can start a session. Now we can easily keep track of the current state of the process that a user is in (and perhaps some other variables), even if he decides to switch pages or take a temporary break from signing up. And then, when the user is done, we just stop the session.</p>

<p>A session can be started on the server with a single function. From that moment on, PHP scripts can save any data they want within the session, and use it everywhere across the application---until the session is closed or deleted.</p>

<h2>Starting Sessions</h2>

<p>To start a session, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">session_start();</code>

<p>This must be placed <em>before</em> any HTML is written into the file, so it's often best to place it as the first line of the file. Unlike cookies, we can't set a specific expiration date---the session will keep working until the user either closes the browser, or we delete the sessions ourselves.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
<?php
  session_start();
?>
<html>
  ...
</html>
</pre>

<p><em>If all of this is stored on the server, how does the server recognize a user?</em> Well, when a session is started, PHP simply plants a small user ID into the browser. If, later on, your scripts want to access session variables, the server will match the user ID it saved with the one on the server, and return the right variables for that specific user.</p>

<h2>Getting &amp; Setting Session Variables</h2>

<p>To get and set a session variable, you can use it like any other variable:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$get_var = $_SESSION["name"];
$_SESSION["name"] = $some_value;</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
//At some page, a sign up process is initialized...
session_start();

$_SESSION["username"] = "John Dorian";
$_SESSION["state"] = 0;

//At another page, the user goes through the process...
if($_SESSION["state"] == 0) {
	echo "Welcome $_SESSION['username'], please choose your password";
} else if($_SESSION["state"] == 1) {
	echo "Please provide your email address";
} else if($_SESSION["state"] == 2) {
	echo "Please tell us a bit about yourself";
} else {
	echo "Thank you! You should receive an email confirmation soon!";
}
</pre>

<h2>Destroying Sessions</h2>

<p>To explicitly destroy a session, it's best to unset all associated variables first and then perform some session destruction. To do so, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">session_unset();
session_destroy();</code>

  title: "[PHP] Databases (MySQL)"
  post: "<p>Last chapter looked at storing relatively small pieces of data, for a small period of time. If the size of the data grows, or we want data to be permanently available to <em>all</em> users, it's best to save it inside a <strong>database</strong>.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, they are the basis for your data; the command centre from which you retrieve, store, and transport all the data. It has, therefore, no certain layout or structure or anything attached to it---it's just raw data stored in tables. And that's exactly when PHP jumps onto the stage. It has to tell the database which parts of the data it wants, and upon retrieving it has to do meaningful things with the data, such as placing it between certain HTML tags and creating a nice layout around them.</p>

<img src="media/PHPDatabasesOverview.png" />

<h2>SQL</h2>

<p>Databases are extremely powerful and behind most products that work with data in any way. But, as I just illustrated, a database works completely separate from PHP, which you also need another <em>language</em> to work with them. For this, there's <strong>SQL</strong>: Structured Query Language. It lets you perform all sorts of queries on databases, such as "load all posts with category X" or "load the 10 newest posts".</p>

<p>If you want to learn SQL (and you certainly should), I advise you to read the <strong><em>SQL Course</em></strong>. I will now just continue explaining how to connect to databases with PHP, assuming you know some SQL. You don't need to be an SQL master, you just need to have a slight sense of the beast I'm talking about here.</p>

<h2>MySQL</h2>

<p>There are many different systems that have implemented SQL. I will explain how to work with the most popular one that most beginners automatically use, MySQL, but the concepts can easily be adapted to other systems. Usually, this simply means changing some letters of the function here and there. (Also, MySQL is free.)</p>

<p>PHP, however, didn't always have support for those powerful <em>Objects</em> we've discussed earlier. This means that the first versions of MySQL worked without objects, and an object-oriented system was implemented much later. It's now recommended, though, to use this object-oriented version, which is called <strong>MySQLi</strong>. So, we'll be talking about that.</p>

<h2>Connecting to the Database</h2>

<p>To connect a database, use:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$conn = new mysqli(<em>$server_name</em>, <em>$username</em>, <em>$password</em>, <em>$database_name</em>);</code>

<p>If you're running PHP locally (with software on your computer), the server is most likely <code>localhost</code>. If you have a website hosted somewhere, you should be able to find information about your databases in the control panel.</p>

<p>If something goes wrong, the error will be attached to the connection object, and you can get it with</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$conn->connect_error</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Connects to the database holding data for a blog
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "administrator", "admin_password", "blog");

if($conn->connect_error) {
	echo "Sorry, something went wrong. Try waiting a few minutes, and then reloading.";
	echo "The error was: " . $conn->connect_error;
}
</pre>

<h2>Performing a Query</h2>

<p>Once a connection has been established, you can perform queries. To do so, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$result = $conn->query("SQL QUERY HERE");</code>

<p>Note that the query returns something---the results---so you need to save that in a variable. Even if your query inserts new data into the database (and doesn't "get" anything), it will return the results of that operation.</p>

<p>To check how many results the query returned, or whether it returned anything at all, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$result->num_rows</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "administrator", "admin_password", "blog");

//This requests the last 10 rows from the table "articles"
$result = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM `articles` ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10");

if($result->num_rows > 0) {
	//display the posts to the user
} else {
	//tell the user we couldn't find anything
}
</pre>

<h2>Fetching the Data</h2>

<p>Even if you've successfully executed a query, PHP isn't sure how to interpret the data, as it can interpret it in numerous ways. Usually, though, the best way is to put the data into an associative array.</p>

<p>PHP, however, has an odd way of dealing with query results. Instead of first saving the results inside an array, and then looping through that, it wants to do both <em>at the same time</em>. So, to loop through all the data you've fetched, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
	<em>do something with current row</em>
}</code>

<p>This saves the next row inside the <code>$row</code> variable, as an associative array, every time the loop runs again. Because it's an associative array, you can access the data in each column with</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$row[<em>"some_column_name"</em>];</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
$result = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM `articles` ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10");

if($result->num_rows > 0) {
  while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
    //Displays the post title
    echo "<h1>" . $row["post_title"] . "</h1>";

    //Displays the actual post
    echo $row["post"];

    //A "footer" added to the end of every post
    echo "<p>Thanks for reading! Please leave a comment below with your thoughts!";
  }
} else {
  echo "Sorry, your search had no results. Perhaps try the homepage?";
}
</pre>

<h2>Closing the Connection</h2>

<p>Once you're done with your business, it's best to close the connection. It's also automatically closed when the user closes the tab, but it's usually wise to save resources wherever you can.</p>

<p>To close it, simply use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">$conn->close();</code>

  title: "[PHP] Error Handling & Debugging"
  post: "<p>Congratulations, you've seen almost all the cool things PHP has to offer! Now, it's time for the other 50% of the programming job---fixing your errors, or <strong>debugging</strong>. Humans aren't perfect (no matter how much we'd like to be that), which means spelling errors slip in, we forget the occasional semicolon here and there, and we lose oversight when projects grow large. Things don't always work the way you expected them to work, but if that happens you can't just quit working on the project. Instead, you need to learn how to find out what went wrong specifically, and how to fix it.</p>

<h2>A Word on Debugging</h2>

<p>I wasn't just throwing hyperboles at you in the introduction; debugging really is a very important aspect of programming. When you write a program, you want it to work exactly like you intended. There's billions of ways things can go wrong, and most of them are easily fixed---however, you can't look inside a computer's head to see what exactly happened. Therefore, when it comes to debugging, <em>the more errors the better</em>.</p>

<p>Every time you write a crucial line of code, or something that is too complex to grasp at first glance, try to make the program throw an error if anything goes wrong.</p>

<p>PHP will automatically throw errors if it finds something wrong with your <em>syntax</em>, but it can't find problems with your <em>logic</em>. If you expect some variable to have the value 2, but it keeps returning value 3 all the time, you clearly did something wrong, but PHP will not throw an error.</p>

<p>So, this chapter will look at the error types PHP automatically throws, and how to implement your own safety mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Errors</h2>

<p>PHP can throw many different types of errors (also called <em>error report levels</em>). These are usually separated into two categories: <strong>fatal errors</strong> that make the program crash and stop executing, and <strong>non-fatal</strong> errors that simply warn you about something but let the program continue.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//This emits a notice telling me that $some_var is undefined, but continues anyway
echo $some_var;

//This prints INF (infinity), but emits a warning that I'm dividing something by zero (which isn't really a possible math operation)
echo 10/0;

//This emits a fatal error which crashes the program
echo 1 << -1;

//Which means this isn't executed anymore
echo "HEY!";
</pre>

<p>There are even more error report levels, but they don't occur often, unless something went very, very wrong with setting up PHP or your server. Nevertheless, you can find them all in the List of <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php">Error Function Constants</a></p>

<h2>Reporting Errors</h2>

<p>To tell PHP which errors you want to see, and which you don't, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">error_reporting(<em>ERROR_CONSTANT<sub>1</sub></em> | <em>&hellip;</em> | <em>ERROR_CONSTANT<sub>N</sub></em>);</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Everything is reported
error_reporting(E_ALL);

//Only warnings and notices are reported
error_reporting(E_WARNING | E_NOTICE);
</pre>

<p>Usually, when developing something you want <em>all</em> errors to turn op, whilst if your program is online and in production, you only want to show the fatal errors.</p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>Exceptions are a lot like errors, but there's a clear distinction that needs to be clarified. Errors are built-in rules for checking whether something went wrong, while exceptions are created by the <em>programmer</em>. The programmer decides whether something is allowed or not, and writes code to handle these <em>exceptions</em> or special cases.</p>

<p>There's nothing inherently wrong with those special cases when it comes to syntax, there's just something wrong with the logic. For example, it's perfectly logical to forbid users from entering birth dates in the future when signing up, even though PHP could perfectly store that date and perform calculations with it.</p>

<p>To throw an exception, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">throw new Exception("some custom error message");</code>

<p>If you don't deal with this exception, it will result in a fatal error. I will talk about handling errors carefully with satin gloves in the next section.</p>

<h2>Catching Errors &amp; Exceptions</h2>

<p>When something goes wrong, we say the program <em>throws</em> an error. Using the same metaphor, we can display any error messages by <em>catching</em> them.</p>

<p>For this, we use a <strong>try-catch block</strong>. When working with crucial or error-prone code, you first <em>try </em>it, and if anything goes wrong, you can let it throw an understandable error instead of wildly crashing. And, perhaps even more importantly, the program continues even if the error was fatal.</p>

<p>The syntax is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">try {
	<em>code</em>
} catch(Throwable <em>$error</em>) {
	<em>do something with the error</em>
} finally {
	<em>code</em>
}</code>

<p>First, you <em>try</em> a piece of code. Then, you <em>catch</em> any error that might have occurred and display it in a readable way, and perhaps do something about it. The last piece, the <em>finally</em> block, is optional and contains code that is executed either way; it doesn't matter if an error occurred. This is useful for checking what the code before it did, and for cleaning up after it or solving the problem.</p>

<p>That word before the variable, <code>Throwable</code>, simply means that it should catch both errors and exceptions. You can also set it to <code>Error</code> or <code>Exception</code> if you want only one type. Either way, the variable will be an object that has the <code>getMessage()</code> method that retrieves the message from the error/exception.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//This prints "Bit shift by negative number", which is a fatal error message telling us exactly what's wrong. But, the program continues without problems, because we've caught it in a try-catch block
try {
	$x = 1 << -1;
} catch(Throwable $e) {
	echo $e->getMessage();
}

//This will tell us that the input number is wrong, so we know exactly why something went wrong in our script
try {
	$x = 15;
	if($x > 1) {
		throw new Exception("Please provide input between 0 and 10");
	} else {
		echo "Thanks for rating this product!";
	}
} catch(Throwable $e) {
	echo $e->getMessage();
}
</pre>

<h2>Triggering Errors</h2>

<p>We've seen the many types of errors that can be forgiving (warnings and notices) or fatal, and we've seen exceptions that must always use a try-catch statement to be solved. These are two ends of a very broad error spectrum, and sometimes you want something in between, which lead to the creation of <em>error triggering</em>---forcing PHP to throw an error of the type we want.</p>

<p>At the start of the chapter, we saw that there were three special user error types: <code>E_USER_ERROR</code>, <code>E_USER_WARNING</code> and <code>E_USER_NOTICE</code>. We can trigger any one of them with</p>

<code class="longsyntax">trigger_error("some error message", ERROR_CONSTANT);</code>

<pre data-lang="php">
//If the ID of the blog post we want is not set in the URL, we want to warn the programmers that something is wrong
if(!isset($_GET['post_id'])) {
	trigger_error("Watch out, the ID is not set!", E_WARNING);
}
</pre>

<p>Last but not least, there's a shorthand for calling a fatal error with a custom message, which is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">die("some error message");</code>

<p>It's quite intuitive actually; you try to do something very important, but if it doesn't work, let the program die!</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Safety mechanism to make sure we handle it right if connecting to a database went wrong.
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "Juan", "Juanisawesomeyeah", "Items");

if($conn->error_message) {
	die("Couldn't connect to database. The error was: " . $conn->error_message);
}

//Any code here will not be executed anymore...

  title: "[PHP] Best Practices"
  post: "<p>So, you're starting to feel like a real PHP wizard by now? Great! Even wizards, however, need to optimize their workflow. There's always more than one way to do something in PHP, and sometimes even multiple "best ways" of doing something. To make sure your scripts stay well organized and as quick and efficient as possible, I want to dedicate this last chapter to programming best practices. Some of it is applicable to all programming languages, some of it is PHP specific.</p>

<h2>Be Consistent</h2>

<p>The first rule is: be consistent and clear with your names---for variables, constants, functions, classes, and so on. Decide on a system, and stick with it. This way, you can easily see what a certain name belongs to and what it does, which saves time and reduces errors.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//An example of naming conventions:
class SomeClassName {
	
}

function some_function_name() {
	$_local_var = 5;
}

$global_var = 10;
const SOME_CONSTANT = 15;
</pre>

<p>Also, use the same PHP tags all the time. I haven't told you this, but there are many other ways to start a PHP block (instead of the regular <code><?php ?></code>). My advice, however, is to ignore them when you see them and just stick with the simplest and clearest one.</p>

<h2>Write Readable Code</h2>

<p>Almost all errors are a result of code that isn't readable, and therefore can't easily be grasped or understood.</p>

<p>The first step to readable code is using proper indentation. If lines of code are not on the same level in the hierarchy, let them have a different indentation!</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//Bad indentation
function some_func() {
$x = 10;
for($i=0;$i<10;$i++) {
echo "The number is $i";
}
}

//Good indentation
function some_func() {
	$x = 10;
	for($i=0;$i<10;$i++) {
		echo "The number is $i";
	}
}
</pre>

<p>The next step is adding comments everywhere. And by that I mean: <em>everywhere</em>. Anytime you write a new function, take time to make a comment above it about what parameters it accepts, and exactly what it does. Anytime you write a new class, write about the properties and methods it has and their functionality. Anytime you write a line of code that seems like it could provide problems in the further, make an insightful comment about it.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
/* FUNCTION: Returns the sum of two numbers
 *
 * @param $a (integer) = first number
 * @param $b (integer) = second number
 */
function sum(int $a, int $b) : int {
	return $a + $b;
}
</pre>

<p>Lastly, there's a balance to be found between the length of the lines and the amount of lines. You don't want lines to be too long (in width), but neither do you want to have a document with thousands of lines. Break strings over multiple lines if you can, and try to only save something inside a variable when you absolutely must.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//An overly complex and long line
$a = (($x > 5 && !($y < 5)) || $x <> $y) ? 5/10 * (5 + $x*$y + $y + $x) : "PANDAS ARE AWESOME AND THEY SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE ENOUGH BAMBOO TO EAT";

//Can sometimes be refactored to be more readable, which also allows you to add comments
$xy_correct = ($x > 5 && (!$y < 5));
$condition = ($xy_correct || $x <> $y);

$value_1 = 0.5 * (5 + $x*$y + $y + $x);
$value_2 = "PANDAS ARE AWESOME AND THEY SHOULD \\
			ALWAYS HAVE ENOUGH BAMBOO TO EAT";

$a = $condition ? $value_1 : $value_2;
</pre>

<h2>Don't Repeat Yourself</h2>

<p>The DRY-principle---<em>Don't Repeat Yourself</em>---is very important in all programming. You don't want to write any piece of code more than once, which is exactly why classes, objects and functions were invented. Not only does this save a tremendous amount of time and effort, it also makes it much easier to change the program at a late stage or to spot problems.</p>

<p>So, any time you think there's a chance you'll need some functionality more than once, turn it into a function or class! Beware, however, of breaking up your program into too many tiny pieces.</p>

<p>In general, functions should accept no more than three parameters. If you find one that needs to do that, rewrite the code and perhaps use more functions. They're called <em>functions </em>for a reason---they should provide a single core <em>functionality</em>, not try to do many things at once that could also be handled by many more specific functions.</p>

<p>Objects, on the other hand, can have as many properties and methods as they need, as long as it seems logical for the object. For example, if you have multiple classes related to animals (<em>Fish</em>, <em>Panda</em>, <em>Bird</em>, &hellip;), it's logical that each of them has a different method for the sound they make, but things like pooping and moving are general functions that you could move into an abstract parent class.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
/* WRONG: This function tries to do too many things at once:
 *   - calculate the final grade
 *	 - assign that grade to the correct course
 *   - assign the right amount of points to the student (if he failed the course, none)
 */
function grading($grades, $weights, $course, $study_points, $student) {

}

// BETTER:
function grading() {
	$grade = calculate_grade([7.6, 9.5], [0.4, 0.6]);
	add_to_course($grade, "Linear Algebra");
	$points = determine_points($grade, 5);
	update_points("Juan", $points);
}

function calculate_grade($grades, $weights) {
	$total = 0;
	for($i=0;$i<sizeof($grades);$i++) {
		$total += $grades[$i] * $weights[$i];
	}
	return $total;
}

function add_to_course($grade, $course) {
	//add this grade to list of all grades in university's database
}

function determine_points($grade, $points) {
	return ($grade >= 5.5) ? $points : 0;
}

function update_points($student, $points) {
	//update the row containing the student's information in the database
}
</pre>

<h2>Optimize</h2>

<p>It's always good to have a faster website that consumes less bandwidth. Therefore, some small optimizations can make a big difference, and can generally do no harm.</p>

<p>Firstly, optimize your loops. A loop can call a block of code many, many times, which means that it can take quite a bit of processing power from the server if that block of code is too complex. Try to reduce the amount of loops, and especially reduce the complexity of the code within them.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
//For example, this loop searches an array for the first sequence of two zeros
$arr = [0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0];

for($i = 0;$i<(sizeof($arr)-1);$i++) {
	if($arr[$i] == 0 && $arr[$i+1] == 0) {
		echo "Found it at position $i!";
	}
}

//What's wrong? The code runs more often than it should (it should end after we've found what we're looking for), and it calculates the size of the array every time. Better is:

$size = (sizeof($arr)-1);
for($i = 0;$i<$size;$i++) {
	if($arr[$i] == 0 && $arr[$i+1] == 0) {
		echo "Found it at position $i!";
		break;
	}
}
</pre>

<p>Secondly, PHP is actually quite lenient when it comes to syntax. Unlike lots of other big programming languages, variables don't need to be declared before you can use them, you can switch between data types any time you want, function names are case-insensitive, and so on. Although this is nice and programmer-friendly, it's also a subtle invitation to be sloppy with your code. Don't.</p>

<p>Write PHP using as many good coding practices and methods as you can. PHP frameworks, such as the popular <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>, can help with this by forcing you to write clean PHP code.</p>

<p>Thirdly, scripts working with databases (which they often do) can also ask quite a lot of resources and bandwidth from the server. You'll want to reduce the amount of SQL queries as much as possible, so choose your SQL query wisely, and use smart PHP code to handle the rest.</p>

<p>Lastly, when it comes to defining constants, it's preferred to use <code>define()</code> over the <code>const</code> keyword. The first defines the constant at runtime, which saves time and resources. Use the latter only when you absolutely need it from the start.</p>

<h2>Provide Backup &amp; Security</h2>

<p>Security is extremely important when it comes to your servers. PHP has lots of special functionality to help you be as secure as possible, which I will talk about in the <strong><em>Advanced PHP</em></strong> course. In the meantime, there's some things you can and should always apply.</p>

<p>First of all, always set <em>default values</em>, and check if a variable is actually set and set to the right type. You don't want to run into errors or bigger problems by working with undefined variables.</p>

<p>Secondly, when testing and debugging, set as many <em>breakpoints</em> as you can. A breakpoint is a place where you echo information from the last piece of code to the browser, so that you can see what was going on in that block of code. Make it a habit to use <code>echo</code> and <code>var_dump</code> to check variables and functionality often.</p>

<pre data-lang="php">
if(!isset($_GET["password"])) {
	echo "Note to self: Somehow, the password is not being set here";
	$password = "defaultpass";
} else {
	$password = $_GET["password"];
}

$a = ($password_correct && $username_correct);
echo $a; //Will print nothing, as $a is either true or false, and both aren't converted to strings
var_dump($a); //Will print useful information, namely bool(true) or bool(false)

  title: "[PHP] Conclusion: what now?"
  post: "<p>After reading this course, you should have a solid understanding of how PHP works, its basic functionality, what you can do with it, and even some advanced functionality. It should be enough to create any moderately complex web application; a blog, a system where users can sign up and log in, a game, anything you want!</p>

<p>In the 28 chapters of this course, however, I couldn't possibly explain every single bit of PHP. If you want to know more, or you're stuck and <em>need</em> to know more, I have made the <strong><em>Advanced Course</em></strong> for that. I can't promise it will be as easy and as much fun as this introductory course, but at least it will turn you from PHP wizard into a PHP god ;)</p>

<p>If that's not your cup of tea, you can already start looking into databases now, especially <strong><em>SQL</em></strong>. Anyone that works with computer systems is going to need databases, also when working with other languages than PHP, so it's generally wise to learn it.</p>

<p>If that still doesn't interest you, then I just wish you good luck on your PHP journey! I hope this course taught you what you wanted to know, and made the huge world of PHP more friendly and comfortable.</p>

  title: "A Guide to SQL"
  post: "<p>Databases are everywhere. When I say database, people often think about websites gathering lots of data about something, so they can use the results to optimize or learn something about their users. That's data analysis, and while you can use databases for that, they can do so much more.</p>

<p>For example, blogs load their posts and comments from a database, user accounts are saved inside a database, online games save game data inside a database, web shops save their products in a database, and so on. Whatever you're working on, if it's going to be even a little complex or dynamic, you'll need a database.</p>

<p>Therefore, we need a way of communicating with databases, a way of telling it to do what we want. Luckily, just like HTML and CSS, there's a single standardized language we can use: <strong>SQL</strong>, which stands for <em>Structured Query Language</em>. Basically, it lets us query the database (such as request specific data from it) following a structured syntax. So, it helps the database understand us better, and it helps us not lose our minds in the complexity of the world of databases.</p>

<p>Just like HTML and CSS, however, SQL on its own isn't enough. A browser is needed to interpret HTML and display it as something meaningful, and in the same way, a database management system is needed to process SQL queries and do something meaningful with it. We call these systems <strong>RDBMS</strong>: <em>Relational Database Management Systems</em>.</p>

<p>You can view SQL as the native tongue of these RDBMS. Generally, they all speak it in nearly the exact same way. The only difference is that each RDBMS has its own dialect; they add and remove some of the functionality of basic SQL in favour of their own system.</p>

<p><img src="media/SQLIntroduction.png" /></p>

<p>Therefore, whichever RDBMS you choose, there will be some differences with the (advanced) syntax and functionality. Most systems add their own functions, change some keywords here and there, or remove things they think they have a better alternative for.</p>

<p>In this course, I will discuss the standardized SQL language, and if necessary mention some RDBMS specific information for the popular databases. Otherwise, you should be fine, or you should be able to find the differences in the documentation of your particular system.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>NOTE: There's one alternative to SQL, which are NoSQL databases that mainly use JavaScript or JavaScript-like syntax. No one is strictly better than the other, and I think you should take a look at both if you plan on doing a lot of work with databases. Both systems are applicable to different use cases.</p>

  title: "[SQL] Installation"
  post: "<p>Before we start, you obviously need to have a way of testing the SQL you're going to write. You have two options:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Install a database system on your own computer via some software</li>
	<li>Buy hosting. The system you want could already be pre-installed, or you can put it on the server yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're learning SQL for (your) business, you probably already have a server and system, and it's wise to stick with learning that particular system for now. If you're here for any other reason, I suggest keeping an open mind and trying out multiple systems!</p>

<h2>Meet the Systems</h2>

<p>There are many systems out there, and it's certainly not needed to learn all of them. The most popular and powerful systems are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>SQLite: </strong>For learning how SQL works, this might be your best option. It's not actually a system; it's a small piece of software that allows you to have a local database on your computer. This means that it doesn't play with the official SQL syntax, and that it's very fast. The only downside is that you can't really use it in websites, as it only allows one user at a time to write data into it.</li>
	<li><strong>MySQL: </strong>The most commonly used system across the world wide web. It's free, beginner-friendly, and can handle very large data sets. Very good at handling simple operations, not so good at handling complex operations.</li>
	<li><strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> A relatively new system that is quickly gaining ground. It's free, adheres to the official SQL syntax the most, and has a rich feature set. Very good at handling complex operations, not so good at handling simple operations.</li>
	<li><strong>Oracle: </strong>Used by some large businesses, a mature and heavyweight system. But, that also means that it isn't free, and there's quite a learning curve.</li>
	<li><strong>Microsoft SQL Server: </strong>Also used by some large business (and most companies that use Microsoft), a mature and big system. However, it also isn't free, and it deviates a lot from the official SQL syntax.</li>
	<li><strong>Microsoft Access:</strong> Essentially a spin-off of SQL server, but meant to be used locally, as a database replacement for Excel. Because of that, some features have been left out, but it still has the same quality as other Microsoft products. It also isn't free.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Systems change, versions change, documentation changes. I don't think I can do a better job explaining how to install a certain database system than the system itself, which is why I will only give a quick explanation and a link to a how-to-install page for every system.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you don't want to get into the database installing business now, find a hosting service that has the system pre-installed for you, so that you can immediately start trying out.</p>

<h3>SQLite</h3>

<p>SQLite comes as a downloadable package, but it doesn't have an interface. This means that queries are submitted to the system via a nifty command line tool.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To download the package: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">SQLite Download</a></li>
	<li>To get started: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html">SQLite Getting Started</a></li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: A good, complete tutorial on SQLite specifically can be found here: <a href="https://www.guru99.com/download-install-sqlite.html">Guru99 SQLite Tutorial</a></p>

<h3>MySQL</h3>

<p>MySQL does have an interface, and can be set up on any system you like.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To read about installing MySQL: <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/installing.html">MySQL Documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>PostgreSQL</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL has very nice documentation. (So, if you're ever in doubt about something, go read their docs!)</p>

<ul>
	<li>To read about installing PostgreSQL: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/tutorial-install.html">PostgreSQL Documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Oracle</h3>

<p>To be honest, Oracle's documentation is very complete, but that also makes it complex for beginners. Nevertheless, if you really want to make the best choice, read through the whole page.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To read about installing Oracle: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e10897/install.htm#ADMQS0212">Oracle Documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>SQL Server</h3>

<p>It's an official Microsoft product, so it has an installation wizard. And the documentation is fine.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To read about installing SQL Server: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143219.aspx">SQL Server Documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>MS Access</h3>

<p>Microsoft Access is just a piece of software (it comes bundled with the Office Suite), so installing it just means <em>installing it</em>.</p>

  title: "[SQL] Relational Databases"
  post: "<p>To make the most use out of learning SQL, I think it's very useful to examine these questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What exactly is a database?</li>
	<li>What's the difference with a relational database?</li>
	<li>Why should I care about databases at all?</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's a Database?</h2>

<p>It's exactly what it says: the base where all your data resides. More importantly, it's <em>nothing but data</em>. It doesn't have a layout, or programmed behaviour, or whatever---it's only data. It's the reason that you need other systems and languages to do something with databases, but it's also the reason why they are so fast, and can hold huge amounts of data.</p>

<p>This "data" can be anything: numbers, pieces of text, prices, passwords, even huge strings that make up an image.</p>

<p>To store the data, we use the best method known to mankind: <strong>tables</strong>. Every row within the table is a single entry, while the columns of the table designate the different properties of that entry. For example, one entry could be a specific user account, with the columns "username", "password" and "email".</p>

<p><img src="media/SQLDefinitionTables.png" /></p>

<h2>What's a Relational Database?</h2>

<p>Essentially, a relational database is one that consists of <strong>multiple tables</strong> that can be related. These tables can reference rows from other tables, and therefore create useful relationships between data.</p>

<p>For example, say you have an online gaming website, where you can win achievements if you finish a game. You have one table containing all users, and one table containing the achievements per game.</p>

<p>Now, one way to store this information, is by adding the username to the string of users that got a certain achievement. With a relational database, however, you can simply reference the corresponding row in the users table. This way, if the username is changed some day, all data is still correct.</p>

<p><img src="media/SQLRelationalDatabases.png" /></p>

<p><em>If it's so useful, what other databases could there possibly be?</em> As I mentioned in the introduction, NoSQL database systems also exist. One of the huge differences between them and SQL systems, is that all SQL systems work with relational databases, while NoSQL doesn't necessarily work that way.</p>

<p>For example, you could have a <em>hierarchical database</em> that is one big table, which has lots of "children tables" that contain data on one specific aspect of the parent. With such a system, data becomes more like a tree structure. Which is useful if you have, you know, data that is connected more like a tree. Don't worry though, we won't be doing anything with that in this course.</p>

<h2>What can a Database do?</h2>

<p>A database is the best possible way to handle data---and data is everywhere. Data can be large, such as a complete blog post or subtitles for a video, or very small, such as a username or the amount of credits in somebody's account. Databases not only store this data in a sensible manner, SQL also provides numerous ways to select exactly the data that you want. You want to show the last 10 comments made? Easily done. You want to find all blog posts with the word "panda"? Done. You want to send a "thank you" message to every user that has been registered for more than a year? You get the idea.</p>

<h2>CRUD</h2>

<p>Every (proper) database has 4 fundamental operations, known as <strong>CRUD</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Create</strong>: Creating a new database, table, or entry.</li>
	<li><strong>Read</strong>: Requesting certain information from the database</li>
	<li><strong>Update</strong>: Changing a certain entry, or the columns of a table</li>
	<li><strong>Delete</strong>: Deleting entries or columns from a table, or deleting a whole table or database</li>
</ul>

<p>With fundamental, I mean that you really can't do anything else. And that's fine, because you won't ever need more than this.</p>

<p>Of these 4 operations, the first two are by far the most complex. First of all, there are many different settings you can use when creating a table. You can set a column to allow only integer numbers, or to allow only strings of text, or to automatically increment every time you add a new entry.</p>

<p>Secondly, there are even more ways to select data. You can select all existing entries, or all entries within a certain category, or all entries with a username that starts with the letter "P"---the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there aren't many ways to change an already existing entry, or to delete data from a table.</p>

<p>I will, therefore, start the course by explaining the CRUD syntax in short, and then use all of the remaining chapters to talk about <em>creating</em> and <em>reading</em> data. From now on, I will also call the columns of a table its <strong>structure</strong>, and one specific value (e.g., row 2 column 2) a <strong>field</strong>. I might also call entries <strong>rows</strong> or <strong>records</strong>, because it's more intuitive sometimes.</p>

  title: "[SQL] Syntax & Queries"
  post: "<p>Like every computer language, SQL has a basic syntax that it uses for everything. Because SQL is so specific to databases, however, this syntax is very simple and you can actually only do one thing: write <strong>queries</strong>.</p>

<h2>Queries</h2>

<p>A query is nothing more than a single request from the database. As we saw in last chapter, this request can be any of the four CRUD operations. For example, you can <em>request</em> the five newest entries in a table, which means you <em>query</em> the table for the five newest entries. So, every time you do something with your database, you're providing a list of queries that should be executed one after the other. Just as with other programming languages, one query is not executed until the previous one finishes.</p>

<p>All we need now, is to have a way to tell the database when one query ends and another begins. For this, we use the <strong>semicolon</strong> ( <code>;</code>).</p>

<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Both of these queries do exactly the same
INSERT INTO users (username, bio, gender) VALUES ("Gandalf", "Use the force, Harry!", "male"); SELECT (username, signup_date, bio) FROM users WHERE gender="female"; 


INSERT INTO 
	users (username, bio, gender) 
VALUES 
	("Gandalf", "Use the force, Harry!", "male"); 

SELECT 
	(username, signup_date, bio) 
FROM 
	users 
WHERE 
	gender="female"; 
</pre>

<p>It's important to note that SQL disregards extra white space and newlines. This means that you can display the query in a way that you can easily understand it, without breaking something. It also means that if you forget a semicolon, errors will pop up all over the place.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>When developing anything, it's often useful to include comments telling you what exactly a certain query is trying to do. These comments are removed when the query is sent to the database and actually executed. Don't worry though, they do not make a query slower.</p>

<p>To create a single-line comment, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">-- Some nice comment here</code>

<p>To create a multi-line comment, <em>if your RDBMS supports it</em>, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">/*
A MULTILINE COMMENT
*/</code>

<h2>Keywords, Functions &amp; Names</h2>

<p>Every query is built out of three components: <em>keywords</em>, <em>functions</em> and <em>names</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords</strong> are words provided by SQL that, well, do something if you include them in the query. For example, the <code>SELECT</code> keyword starts a query that reads things from a database.</p>

<p><strong>Functions</strong> transform the data of a query. For example, the <code>AVG(<em>column</em>)</code> function takes the average of all values of the specified column.</p>

<p><strong>Names</strong> are the names of your columns, tables, databases---anything that you've given a name.</p>

<pre data-lang="sql">
-- SELECT, FROM and WHERE are keywords
-- COUNT(*) is a function that counts the amount of entries
-- users is a table name we decided ourselves

SELECT 
	COUNT(*) 
FROM 
	users  
</pre>

<h2>Case Insensitivity</h2>

<p>Everything in SQL is case insensitive. This means that you can write <code>select</code>, or <code>SELECT</code>, or <code>Select</code>, or whatever spelling you want. Writing the words differently every time, however, is not a good idea.</p>

<p>It's best practice to write your keywords and functions in <em>all uppercase</em>, and to choose your column and table names <em>all lowercase</em>. If needed, separate words are connected with an underscore ( <code>_</code> ).</p>

<pre data-lang="sql">
-- All queries do exactly the same, but I think you can see which one reads better;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;

select Count(*) from USERS;

Select count(*) From users;
</pre>

<p>NOTE: The names you decide yourself are <strong>not</strong> case insensitive. For example, you could have a column named <code>user_id</code>, and one named <code>USER_ID</code>, and they would be completely different.</p>

<h2>Dynamic Queries</h2>

<p>Most RDBMS have an interface that allows you directly put in queries. While this can be very useful to do some database maintenance, such as remove some garbage or replace things that need to be updated, it's not that useful to most applications. Usually, you want to execute an SQL query when users load a page, and you want that query to change depending on certain variables.</p>

<p>For example, most blogs use only a single file for displaying all posts. When a user visits a URL, there is usually some information about the post in the URL (such as <code>/News/05-06-2016/hello-world</code>). You must use a programming language (not SQL) to get these variables, and put them into a query that selects the right blog post. That programming language then sends the query to the database, retrieves the results, and displays them in a sensible manner.</p>

<img src="media/SQLDynamicQueries.png" />

<p>Therefore, if you haven't done so already, it's wise to also learn a server-side language (such as PHP or ASP.NET) that can interact with SQL and databases. Remember, SQL is for databases, not for layout or websites.</p>

  title: "[SQL] Creating"
  post: "<p>When it comes to a relational database, we can create three things: a database, a table, and a specific entry. The commands for these operations are all quite straightforward---the real complexity comes when you learn about the best settings for your structure.</p>

<p>To clarify this statement, say you have a database containing all user accounts. Creating the database is easy (make up a name and run a single command), as well as inserting a row (provide data and run a single command). But, the structure of the table must be constrained---for example, it should not be possible that a user has no username, or no password, or that his email address is a number instead of text.</p>

<h2>Creating a Database</h2>

<p>Let's start very, very simple. To create a new database, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">CREATE DATABASE <em>someDatabaseName</em>;</code>

<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Creates a database called users, with nothing in it (yet)
CREATE DATABASE users;
</pre>

<h2>Creating a Table</h2>

<p>To create a table, we must first navigate to the correct database. (If we don't, SQL doesn't know in which database to place the table.)</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you have an interface to work with, you can simply click on the database and perform the query there.</li>
	<li>If you're working with a programming language (such as PHP), you should be able to connect to the right database with some function, and all will be fine.</li>
	<li>Otherwise, you can select the database with <code>USE someDatabaseName</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Now that the right database is selected, we can create a table with</p>

<code class="longsyntax">CREATE TABLE <em>someTableName</em>
	(<em>column_name_1 type attributes</em>,
	 <em>column_name_2 type attributes</em>,
			|
	 <em>column_name_n type attributes</em>);</code>

<p>The <em>type</em> parameter specifies the type of data the column will hold, and is required. Examples of data types are <code>INTEGER</code> and <code>TEXT</code>.</p>

<p>The <em>attributes</em> parameter is optional, and can set properties for a certain column. Examples of attributes are <code>NOT NULL</code> (it's never allowed to have an empty value) and <code>AUTO INCREMENT</code> (the value of this column is automatically incremented with 1 every time a new entry is added).</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
USE users;

/* 
Creates a table to hold usernames and corresponding email address
INT(11) just tells it to hold an integer of at most 11 digits
VARCHAR(255) means the column should hold strings of at most 255 characters
*/

	<table class="databaseTable">

		<tr><td colspan="3">No entries yet.</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>NOTE: As promised, you'll learn all about structure, constraints and data types in later chapters.</p>

<h2>Creating a new Entry</h2>

<p>When we create a new entry, we usually call it <strong>inserting</strong> an entry. It's a more intuitive way of looking at it, as we're not really creating anything, we're just inserting data in an already existing table. Not surprisingly, the command for inserting an entry is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">INSERT INTO <em>someTableName</em> 
	(<em>column_1</em>, <em>&hellip;</em>, <em>column_n</em>)
VALUES 
	(<em>value_1</em>,<em> &hellip;</em>,<em> value_n</em>);</code>

<p>As you can see, you don't necessarily have to insert values for all columns. If you leave out some columns, they will be set to the default value you specified when you created the table structure. This saves time and effort from your side.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you don't specify any columns at all, SQL is going to assume you want to insert data into all columns.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
INSERT INTO accounts (id, username, email) 
       VALUES (1,"Panda","panda@pandaqi.com"); 

INSERT INTO accounts VALUES (2,"Ginty",""); 

INSERT INTO accounts VALUES ("Juan","juaniscool@gmail.com");

INSERT INTO accounts VALUES ("Gandalf");  
</pre>
<div>

  title: "[SQL] Reading"
  post: "<p>The most important operation you can perform on databases is reading data from it. The whole reason you need a database in the first place, is so that you can do something useful with the information it provides. Because you're usually not reading everything within the database, we call this process <strong>selecting</strong>. You select the information you're looking for from the database, and then you use some other programming language to do whatever you want with it. In this chapter I will provide the very basic syntax for reading from a database, in the rest of this course many additions and variations will be discussed.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The very basic syntax for selecting entries from a table is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT <em>column_1</em>, <em>&hellip;</em>,<em> column_n</em> FROM <em>someTableName</em>;</code>

<p>This selects the columns you specified of <em>all</em> the rows in the table <em>someTableName</em>.</p>

<p>If you want to select all columns as well, use the asterisk ( <code>*</code> ) character:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT * FROM <em>someTableName</em>;</code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Selects the columns username and email from every entry in the table
SELECT username, email FROM accounts;  
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>username</td><td>email</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>panda@pandaqi.com</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Ginty</td><td></td></tr>
		<tr><td>Juan</td><td>juaniscool@gmail.com</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Gandalf</td><td></td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Finding Rows</h2>

<p>You usually don't need all the rows. Instead, you're looking for rows that fulfil a certain condition; for example, rows that belong to the same category, or all rows that were inserted by a certain user.</p>

<p>To modify our selection to find only the entries that we want, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT <em>__</em> FROM <em>__</em> WHERE <em>condition</em>;</code>

<p>Again, SQL always tries to make queries feel like a real English sentence. "Select these columns, from this table, where this condition is true" is a simple way to remember the syntax.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Selects all accounts with an email address set
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE email NOT IS NULL;  
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td style="white-space:pre;">username</td><td>email</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda</td><td>panda@pandaqi.com</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>2</td><td>Ginty</td><td></td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Juan</td><td>juaniscool@gmail.com</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>4</td><td>Gandalf</td><td></td></tr>

  title: "[SQL] Updating"
  post: "<p>Once you've created your tables, and inserted lots of entries, there will come a time when you want to change some things. More specifically, you can: change the <em>structure</em> of a table, or change the <em>values</em> of an entry.</p>

<h2>Altering the Structure</h2>

<p>When it comes to updating or changing the structure, we call it <em>altering</em> instead. Not surprisingly, every query related to this starts with the <code>ALTER</code> keyword.</p>

<h3>Adding Columns</h3>

<p>To add a column to a table, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">ALTER TABLE <em>tableName</em> ADD <em>column_name type attributes</em>;</code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Adds a new column, on top of id, username and email
ALTER TABLE accounts ADD password VARCHAR(255); 
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>username</td><td>email</td><td style="white-space:pre;">password</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda</td><td>panda@pandaqi.com</td><td>1234</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Ginty</td><td></td><td>pikapika</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Juan</td><td>juaniscool@gmail.com</td><td>butterfree</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>Gandalf</td><td></td><td>flyyoufools</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Removing Columns</h3>

<p>To remove a column from a table, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">ALTER TABLE <em>tableName</em> DROP COLUMN <em>column_name</em>;</code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- We noticed users don't like giving us their email, so we remove that column
ALTER TABLE accounts DROP COLUMN email; 
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>username</td><td>password</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda</td><td>1234</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Ginty</td><td>pikapika</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Juan</td><td>butterfree</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>Gandalf</td><td>flyyoufools</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Modifying---Changing Column Type</h3>

<p>To modify an already existing column means two things: changing the <em>type</em>, or changing the <em>name</em>. Unfortunately, the syntax is slightly different across different database systems.</p>

<code class="longsyntax">ALTER TABLE <em>tableName</em> ALTER <em>column_name</em> SET<em> type attributes</em>;<span class="extraInformation">SQLite<br/>PostgreSQL</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax">ALTER TABLE <em>tableName</em> ALTER COLUMN <em>column_name type attributes</em>;<span class="extraInformation">SQL Server<br/>MS Access</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax">ALTER TABLE <em>tableName</em> MODIFY COLUMN <em>column_name type attributes</em>;<span class="extraInformation">MySQL<br/>Oracle (<10G)</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax">ALTER TABLE <em>tableName </em>MODIFY <em>column_name type attributes</em>;<span class="extraInformation">Oracle (>=10G)</span></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Additionally, we noticed users started taking unnecessarily long usernames, so we're going to change that column to only accept shorter strings.
ALTER TABLE accounts MODIFY COLUMN username VARCHAR(12);

</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>username</td><td>password</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda</td><td>1234</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Ginty</td><td>pikapika</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Juan</td><td>butterfree</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>GandalfTheGr</td><td>flyyoufools</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Modifying---Changing Column Name</h3>

<p>Changing the name of an already existing column is much easier, simply use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">ALTER TABLE <em>tableName</em> RENAME <em>old_column</em> TO <em>new_column</em>;</code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- And we thought the word secret_spy_name sounded cooler than username
ALTER TABLE accounts RENAME username TO secret_spy_name;

</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td style="white-space:pre;">secret_spy_name</td><td>password</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda</td><td>1234</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Ginty</td><td>pikapika</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Juan</td><td>butterfree</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>GandalfTheGr</td><td>flyyoufools</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Updating Entries</h2>

<p>Changing entries, as opposed to altering table structure, is usually called <em>updating</em> an entry. Therefore, such queries always start with the <strong>UPDATE</strong> keyword.</p>

<p>The syntax for updating entries---you can update multiple entries at the same time---is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">UPDATE <em>tableName</em>
SET (<em>column_name</em> = <em>new_value</em>, <em>&hellip;</em>, <em>column_name</em> = <em>new_value</em>)
WHERE <em>condition</em>;</code>

<p>Including the <code>WHERE</code> clause is very important, because if you don't, SQL will just update <em>all</em> the entries with the new information. For the rest, it works exactly the same as in the <code>SELECT</code> statement---"Update this table by setting these columns to these values, where a row meets a certain condition"</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- User Panda forgot his password, again, so we send him a password reset email, and temporarily reset his password to "whatislovebabydonthurtme";
UPDATE
	accounts
SET
	(password = "whatislovebabydonthurtme")
WHERE
	secret_spy_name = "Panda";

</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td style="white-space:pre;">secret_spy_name</td><td>password</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda</td><td>whatislovebabydonthurtme</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Ginty</td><td>pikapika</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Juan</td><td>butterfree</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>GandalfTheGr</td><td>flyyoufools</td></tr>

  title: "[SQL] Deleting"
  post: "<p>Last but not least, instead of updating something, you might just want to delete it altogether. This can be useful if entries are not needed anymore; for example, when a user closes her account on a website, or if you want to automatically remove obsolete data that's more than 5 years old. Again, a distinction has to be made between multiple types of deletion: deleting a <em>database</em>, deleting a <em>table</em>, and deleting an <em>entry</em>.</p>

<h2>Deleting Databases</h2>

<p>To delete a complete database, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">DROP DATABASE <em>someDatabaseName</em>;</code>

<p>I must strongly urge you to always make sure you don't create a program that might accidentally remove something, or that might allow users to remove something. SQL doesn't send you a warning message to confirm if you really want to delete the database---once you've issued the command, the database is gone.</p>

<h2>Deleting Tables</h2>

<p>To delete a table, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">DROP TABLE <em>someTableName</em>;</code>

<h2>Deleting Entries</h2>

<p>To delete one or multiple entries, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">DELETE FROM <em>someTableName</em> WHERE <em>condition</em>;</code>

<p>Again, do not forget to include the <code>WHERE</code> clause, or all entries within the table will be deleted. Always make sure you have the proper condition for deleting an entry. This mostly means that the condition should not return true in unexpected cases---make sure every entry has something that makes it unique, so you don't accidentally remove more rows than you intended.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Juan's cover has been compromised, and his secret spy name leaked, so he needs to remove all traces of him on the interwebs
DELETE FROM accounts WHERE (id = 3 && secret_spy_name = "Juan");
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td style="white-space:pre;">secret_spy_name</td><td>password</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda</td><td>whatislovebabydonthurtme</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Ginty</td><td>pikapika</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>GandalfTheGr</td><td>flyyoufools</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Truncation</h2>

<p>If you want to remove all entries, however, there's a quicker and better way. Erasing all the data within a table, but <em>not</em> erasing the table itself, is called <strong>truncating</strong>. The syntax is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">TRUNCATE TABLE <em>someTableName</em>;</code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Oh boy, our enemies tortured Juan to find out the names of his comrads, and he gave in to the pressure! We need to remove all traces of all spies.
TRUNCATE TABLE accounts;
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">

  title: "[SQL] Structure"
  post: "<p>Databases from professional grade applications usually contain thousands and thousands of rows. For example, imagine the sheer amount of users that Twitter has, or the amount of videos uploaded to Youtube. In order to quickly create new entries, and select the exact entries you want from such huge databases, you will need to be smart about your table structure.</p>

<p>More specifically, you want to have the least data possible stored in the database, and you need to tell the database system exactly what type of data it's holding, so that working with it becomes much faster. This is done with two things: <strong>constraints</strong> and <strong>keys</strong>. This chapter will mainly talk about things that <em>must</em> be done for every table.</p>

<h2>Primary Keys</h2>

<p>The first thing that must be true for every table, is that <em>every entry must be unique</em>. If multiple entries are identical, which means the value for every column is exactly the same, you can't select only one of them---which is a problem.</p>

<p>For example, say we have a table containing user accounts. When a user logs in, we fetch its profile information from the database and display it. If we had two identical entries, however, we would always select more than one row, and our script wouldn't know what to do! It expects one row and wants to deal with that, but now it will always have two, which it can't distinguish in any way whatsoever.</p>

<p>So, to make every entry unique, every table must have exactly one <strong>primary key</strong>. A column that is a primary key must contain <strong>unique values</strong> and may never contain no value (so-called <code>NULL</code>). If you try to insert a value that already exists, SQL will throw an error and your query will not be executed.</p>

<p>NOTE: It is possible to create a table without primary key, but that's only recommended if you're storing lots and lots of data for personal use (as you don't need it then, and it saves time). Otherwise, even when highly in doubt, use a primary key.</p>

<p>Usually, a column called <code>id</code> is used to assign a numeric id to every entry. This way, even if all the other values are the same, the id will be different, and can be used to uniquely identify every entry.</p>

<p>To set a column to be primary key, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>column_name type</em>,
PRIMARY KEY (<em>column_name</em>)<span class="extraInformation">MySQL</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>column_name type</em> PRIMARY KEY<span class="extraInformation">Others</span></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
CREATE TABLE users
	(id  INT(11) PRIMARY KEY,
	 usn VARCHAR(50));

INSERT INTO users VALUES (1,"Panda");
INSERT INTO users VALUES (2,"Juan");
-- This is not allowed.
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1,"Gandalf");
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>usn</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Juan</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Advanced Primary Keys</h2>

<p>It's also possible to create a primary key out of multiple columns, in which case you need to give it a special name yourself. Remember that this is still just one, unique primary key column---it's just created by adding together several other columns.</p>

<code class="longsyntax">CONSTRAINT <em>primaryKeyName</em> PRIMARY KEY (<em>column_1</em>, <em>&hellip;</em>, <em>column_n</em>)</code>

<p>The query above creates a primary key called <em>primaryKeyName</em> which holds the result of <em>column_1 + &hellip; + column_n</em> for every entry. Obviously, this value should be unique for each entry.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- This table stores courses. However, a course is given multiple times a year, so we need a second id to distinguish each one of them.
CREATE TABLE courses
	(id        INT(11),
	 second_id INT(11),
	 name      VARCHAR(50),
	 CONSTRAINT primKey PRIMARY KEY (id, signup_date));

-- Has primKey 2
INSERT INTO courses VALUES (1,1,"Calculus");
-- Has primKey 3
INSERT INTO courses VALUES (1,2,"Calculus");
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>second_id</td><td>course</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Calculus</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>Calculus</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Defaults</h2>

<p>The second thing that must be true for every table, is that <em>every field must have a value</em>. Even if you don't know the value yet, or the value has somehow (accidentally) disappeared, there has to be <em>some</em> value.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, wise to set a default for such columns. If you don't do so, columns will default to the value <code>NULL</code> if you don't specify a value yourself. (More on that in the next section.)</p>

<p>To set a default for a column, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>column_name type</em> DEFAULT <em>default_value</em></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- If a user leaves a comment, but isn't logged in, set the name to "Anonymous" by default
CREATE TABLE comments
	(id      INT(11),
	 name    VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT "Anonymous",
	 comment VARCHAR(255));

INSERT INTO comments VALUES (1,"Panda","Nice article!");
INSERT INTO comments VALUES (2, NULL  ,"This article is garbage. I'm cool because I anonymously leave hateful comments online.");
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>name</td><td>comment</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda</td><td>Nice article!</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Anonymous</td><td>This article is garbage. I'm cool because I anonymously leave hateful comments online.</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Null</h2>

<p>The <code>NULL</code> value is a special one. It represents <em>missing </em>or <em>unknown</em> <em>data</em>, which means it's useful if you don't know a field's value yet, but also that you can't really perform any meaningful operations with it.</p>

<p>To forbid a column from having <code>NULL</code> values, use the following constraint</p>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>column_name type</em> NOT NULL</code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- But, anonymous users don't leave very nice comments on our website, so we decide it's not allowed anymore. 
ALTER TABLE comments ALTER name SET VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL;

-- This is not allowed anymore
INSERT INTO users (id, comment) VALUES (3,"Thanks for sharing!");

-- However, this works fine; an empty string, or 0, is NOT the same as NULL
INSERT INTO users VALUES (3,"", "No problemo!");
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>name</td><td>comment</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda</td><td>Nice article!</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Anonymous</td><td>This article is garbage. I'm cool because I anonymously leave hateful comments online.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td> </td><td>No problemo!</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>NOTE: This is a constraint you'll need very often, and I advise you to use it on every column that is critical to your application.</p>

<h2>Best Relational Practices</h2>

<p>At the start of this course, I listed all the advantages of relational database systems. But, you might be wondering, how do I actually use this in the best way possible?</p>

<p>Well, we use something called <strong>normalization</strong>. Normalization is a process where you minimize redundancy and dependency---in other words, you make sure there's no duplicate data in your table.</p>

<p>For example, say you have a table containing your blog <em>posts</em>, and a table containing all the <em>categories</em> and brief descriptions of whatever that category is about. What you could do, is create a column in the <em>posts</em> table that holds the exact name of the category a post was put in. What's better, however, is to let that column hold references to the entries in the <em>categories</em> table.</p>

<p>This has two huge benefits:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the name of the category ever changes, everything is automatically updated</li>
	<li>The table needs to store less data, which saves space and makes queries faster.</li>
</ul>

<img src="media/SQLNormalization.png" />

<p>In conclusion, try to make sure you never repeat yourself. Think about which tables you need (and their structure) upfront, and make sure they reference each other in a meaningful way. Make sure you never store more data than needed, because it would waste valuable space and resources. More about this, and about setting other important constraints and data types, is covered in next chapters.</p>"

  title: "[SQL] Keys & Constraints"
  post: "<p>Continuing on last chapter, we'll be talking about the rest of the (more advanced) keys and constraints. These are: <em>auto increment</em>, <em>unique</em>, <em>check</em> and <em>foreign keys</em>.</p>

<h2>Auto Increment</h2>

<p>The auto increment constraint is typically used on the primary key. It does exactly what it says: it automatically increments the value of a certain column for you. Whenever you insert a new entry, it checks the last value of the auto increment column, and inserts (<em>last_value + 1</em>) for the new entry.</p>

<p>This saves you lots of time and energy, as you don't need to keep track of the last value of the column yourself, and all values in the column are automatically unique.</p>

<p>NOTE: Most database systems also let you set the starting value of the column, and allow larger increments than 1. For example, you could add 1000 every time, if that's what you needed.</p>

<p>The syntax is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>column_name type</em> AUTO_INCREMENT
ALTER TABLE <em>someTable</em> AUTO_INCREMENT=<em>start</em><span class="extraInformation">MySQL</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>column_name type</em> AUTOINCREMENT(<em>start</em>, <em>interval</em>)<span class="extraInformation">SQLite<br/>PostgreSQL<br/>MS Access</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>column_name type</em> IDENTITY(<em>start</em>, <em>interval</em>)<span class="extraInformation">SQL Server</span></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
CREATE TABLE posts
	(id    INT(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO INCREMENT,
	 title VARCHAR(255),
	 post  LONGTEXT);

-- Notice how we don't insert an id
INSERT INTO posts (title, post) VALUES ("Panda captured.", "Today, we captured a panda. He is safe now.");
INSERT INTO posts (title, post) VALUES ("PANDA ESCAPED!", "Oh no, our pet panda has escaped and is now wreaking havoc in our cities!");
INSERT INTO posts (title, post) VALUES ("Tiger captured.", "Today, we captured a tiger. it is safe now. What can go wrong?");
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>title</td><td>post</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda captured.</td><td>Today, we captured a panda. He is safe now.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>PANDA ESCAPED!</td><td>Oh no, our pet panda has escaped and is now wreaking havoc in our cities!</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Tiger captured.</td><td>Today, we captured a tiger. it is safe now. What can go wrong?</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>NOTE: Oracle doesn't support a simple auto increment feature---instead, you can emulate it using sequences, which will be discussed later.</p>

<h2>Unique</h2>

<p>As the name suggests, the <code>UNIQUE</code> keyword forces a column to only contain unique values---no two values may be the same, and if you try to insert an entry with an already existing value, it will throw errors and crash.</p>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>column_name type attributes,</em>
UNIQUE (<em>column_name</em>)<span class="extraInformation">MySQL</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>column_name type</em> UNIQUE<span class="extraInformation">Others</span></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- We demand every user has a username, and that username is unique
CREATE TABLE users
	(id       INT(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO INCREMENT,
	 username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL);

INSERT INTO posts (username) VALUES("Juan");
INSERT INTO posts (username) VALUES("Panda");

-- Not allowed.
INSERT INTO posts (username) VALUES("Juan");
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>username</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Juan</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Panda</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>You can also create a unique constraint over multiple columns. This means that the combination of values must be unique across the table, not that those values itself must be different. For example, if one entry has values (2,2,3) and another has (2,3,2), they will be unique. If they both have (2,2,3), they are not.</p>

<p>The syntax is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">CONSTRAINT <em>someName</em> UNIQUE (<em>column_1</em>,<em> &hellip;</em>,<em> column_n</em>)</code>

<h2>Check</h2>

<p>The <code>CHECK</code> constraint simply <em>checks</em> whether a certain condition is true when inserting a new entry. If it's true, everything's fine. If not, the entry is rejected. You can use this, for example, to make sure somebody can't place a negative amount of orders on your web shop.</p>

<p>The syntax is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>column_name type attributes,</em>
CHECK (<em>condition</em>)<span class="extraInformation">MySQL</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>column_name type </em>CHECK (<em>condition</em>)<span class="extraInformation">Others</span></code>

<p>Again, to place a check on multiple columns at the same time, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">CONSTRAINT <em>someName</em> CHECK (<em>condition_1 </em>AND <em>condition_2 </em>AND <em>&hellip;</em>);</code>

<p>NOTE: I will explain the <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> operators, and many more things about conditions, in the later chapters about reading from the database.</p>

<h2>Foreign Keys</h2>

<p>As you might have noticed by now, keywords and concepts in SQL are named quite intuitively. If you know the name, you know the syntax and the idea behind it. Foreign keys are no different.</p>

<p>A column that is set to be a foreign key, only contains references to the primary key of another table. In other words, such a column contains the primary keys from a foreign table.</p>

<p>Foreign keys are useful for <em>normalizing</em> your database (remember I introduced that term at the end of last chapter?). Instead of inserting all the actual data inside a table, you simply insert the primary key value of an entry from another table. Then, if you need the actual data, just select the right entry from the other table (with another query).</p>

<p>Because foreign keys reference primary keys, they are automatically never <code>NULL</code>, and they always reference exactly one entry (because of uniqueness). They do not, however, need to be unique themselves. For example, say you have a table (for a web shop) that holds the orders that have been placed, and a table that holds all users. It's perfectly possible, then, that one user places multiple orders, and thus the orders table has multiple identical values for the user column.</p>

<p>The syntax for foreign keys is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>column_name type attributes,</em>
FOREIGN KEY (<em>column_name</em>) REFERENCES <em>Table</em>(<em>foreign_column</em>)<span class="extraInformation">MySQL</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>column_name type </em>FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES <em>Table</em>(<em>foreign_column</em>)<span class="extraInformation">Others</span></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Our post_id references the primary key of the posts table (used at the start of this chapter), so that we know which post a certain comment belongs to.
CREATE TABLE comments
	(id       INT(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO INCREMENT,
	 comment  VARCHAR(255),
	 post_id  INT(11) FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES posts(id));

INSERT INTO comments (comment, post_id) VALUES ("Dude, you really need to keep those pandas from escaping.", 2);
INSERT INTO comments (comment, post_id) VALUES ("Cool, a tiger!", 3);
INSERT INTO comments (comment, post_id) VALUES ("Your panda ate my crops!", 2);
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>comment</td><td>post_id</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Dude, you really need to keep those pandas from escaping.</td><td>2</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Cool, a tiger!</td><td>3</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Your panda ate my crops!</td><td>2</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again, you can define a foreign key on multiple columns at the same time. This is needed if your primary key was also created out of multiple columns. The syntax is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">CONSTRAINT <em>someName</em>
FOREIGN KEY (<em>column_1</em>,<em> &hellip;</em>,<em> column_n</em>)
REFERENCES <em>Table</em>(<em>foreign_column_1</em>,<em> &hellip;</em>,<em> foreign_column_n</em>);</code>"

  title: "[SQL] Data Types"
  post: "<p>When defining keys and constraints, and creating tables in general, you've seen me include the <em>type</em> in the syntax. You've probably already guessed what it is used for, but I haven't had the time to properly introduce these <strong>data types</strong>. This changes now!</p>

<p>Every column <em>must</em> be set to a certain data type. This data type will determine what kinds of values are allowed to be stored for that column. For example, a column that holds usernames can be set to data type <code>TEXT</code> with a maximum length of 100 characters, while the column that stores how many credits each user has in their account could be an <code>INTEGER</code>.</p>

<p><em>Why do I need to use these data types?</em> Efficiency and good organization. If the database knows exactly what kinds of values it will have in a certain column, it needs to perform less operations and can execute your queries faster. Additionally, by forcing every column to only contain values of one data type, you force your tables to be organized correctly and logically.</p>

<p><em>Alright, tell me the data types already!</em> Not so fast, my friend. As usual, every database system was being egocentric, and implemented their own version of data types. Every system borrowed some data types from the official SQL standard, threw some of them out, and perhaps added one or two itself.</p>

<p>Therefore, I will provide the official SQL data types, and include links to the documentation for each system. There, you will find the peculiarities regarding data types for each system, and which data types it does or doesn't support.</p>

<h2>The Data Types</h2>

<p>Don't worry trying to learn and remember all of these. The list is here to give a general sense of how data types work and which categories exist. You can just look at the types your specific system provides when you start creating your own database system.</p>

	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Let me clarify some of the terms used:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>*Binary strings are simply strings of <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s.</li>
		<li>**Mantissa precision refers to the number of digits in a certain base notation. In the case of SQL, this means that any number can be written as <em>m </em>* <em>10^n</em>, where mantissa precision is the amount of digits that <em>m</em> has.</li>
		<li>***An integer field is something that has a starting point, and an end point, and contains every number between start and end.</li>
	</ul>

<p>Even though the actual name for a type may differ, the syntax remains the same across systems. Simply type the name of the data type in capital letters, and if needed, provide the parameters between parentheses.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- id is an integer of at most 11 digits, primary key and auto increment are additional attributes or constraints we put on it
-- name of the video is a string of at most 255 characters long
-- video_id is used to access the video, like Youtube's ?v=ZMtNyG5OPqM, and is a fixed length string
-- time_uploaded holds the time at which the video was first uploaded
CREATE TABLE videos
	(id            INT(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO INCREMENT,

<h2>Data Types per System</h2>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/datatype.html">PostgreSQL</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html">SQLite</a> 
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>SQLite actually doesn't force your columns into specific data types. Instead, it just supports a few general data types and changes the column based on whatever data you throw into it.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/data-types.html">MySQL</a>
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>Their documentation page is quite unorganized at the time of speaking. So, know that its data types are divided into three categories: <em>numeric </em>(integers and decimal numbers), <em>strings</em> (text and even more text), and <em>date and time</em>. Click each one to get the full overview for the category.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/nl-nl/library/ms187752.aspx">SQL Server</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714540(v=vs.85).aspx">MS Access</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28318/datatype.htm">Oracle</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>

<p>It's generally best to make the data type constraint as tight and accurate as possible. If you expect to use strings of at most 10 characters for now, set the data type to be <code>VARCHAR(10)</code>. If you can make something into a string of fixed length, do so.</p>

<p>If you can store something as a number instead of a string, go for it! We already saw this with foreign keys, but it can also be applied in many other cases. For example, say you have a column <em>email_confirmed</em> in your <em>users</em> table. Then, you could use the values <code>"yes"</code> and <code>"no"</code>, but you can also just use <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>, which is shorter.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you don't want to be surprised by your own constraints. For example, say you have a primary key <em>id</em> in your <em>users</em> table, which has <code>AUTO INCREMENT</code> set on it. If you have thousands of users signing up every hour, this <em>id</em> will grow larger and larger very quickly. In these cases, you want to give yourself some breathing space, and set it to be an integer of, say, at most 10 digits.</p>

  title: "[SQL] Operators & Conditions"
  post: "<p>Earlier in this course, you've seen me mention <em>conditions</em> several times. When selecting entries from a database, we saw that we can choose only the entries for which a specified condition is true---for example, only select articles that were posted in the month of January, or select all users with a username longer than 20 characters.</p>

<p>While some of those conditions could be used when creating the table structure, such as with the <code>CHECK</code> constraint, they will become much more important when reading data from a database. When selecting data, we usually don't want all of it, and using conditions is the only way to (logically) specify exactly which entries we want. Remember this:</p>

> An entry in an SQL query is selected only if the corresponding condition is <em>true</em>

<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>

<p>Conditions make heavy use of <strong>operators</strong>, but before we dive into conditional operators, I want to show the other type of operator: basic arithmetic.</p>

<p>The five arithmetic operators are:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Operator</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>+</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Addition</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>-</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Subtraction</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>*</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Multiplication</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>/</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Division</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>%</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Modulus ( = remainder after integer division)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>As usual, they require two values around it (one on the left, one on the right), which we call its <strong>operands</strong>. As you'd also expect, you can use parentheses to determine the execution order. You could use these operators, for example, to transform a fixed value into percentages.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Select the name of each product, and the multiplication of the price and discount columns (which is their final price)
SELECT name, price*discount FROM products;
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>name</td><td>price*discount</td></tr>
		<tr><td>LEGO</td><td>18.67</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Plush Panda</td><td>56.77</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Conditional Operators</h2>

<p>These operators are also called <em>comparison operators</em>, and for a good reason: they compare the operands. Then, they return <em>true</em> if the comparison was true, and <em>false</em> otherwise. For example, you could compare if the <em>signup date</em> of a certain user is later than the <em>signup date</em> of another user. Or, you could compare if the amount of points a certain user has scored in your game is less than that of another user.</p>

<p>The conditional operators are:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Operator</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>=</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if operands are equal</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>!=</code><br/>
				<code><></code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if operands are <em>not</em> equal</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>> </code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the left operand <em>is greater than</em> the right operand</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>>=</code><br/>
				<code>!<</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the left operand <em>is greater than or equal to</em> the right operand</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>< </code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the left operand <em>is less than</em> the right operand</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code><=</code><br/>
				<code>!></code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the left operand <em>is less than or equal to</em> the right operand</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Selects all products that cost at most 20 euros
SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE price <= 20;
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>name</td><td>price</td></tr>
		<tr><td>LEGO</td><td>12.50</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Plush Panda</td><td>75.00</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Playmobil</td><td>18.50</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Playstation</td><td>80.00</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Keychain</td><td>5.00</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>

<p>We've seen how to create a single condition, and we've seen how to transform the values with some arithmetic---but what if we want to use multiple conditions? For that, we use <em>logical operators</em>.</p>

<h3>General Logic</h3>

<p>Essentially, logical operators chain together multiple conditions. With general logic operators, you can glue together any amount and any type of conditions.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Operator</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>AND</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if both conditions are true</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>OR</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if at least one of the conditions is true</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>NOT</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the condition is false</p>

			<p>It inverses your condition, and is often called the <em>negate operator</em>.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Again, parentheses will help you out with grouping your conditions.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Juan wants to buy a present for his kids, but doesn't want to spend more than 20 euros.
SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE price <= 20 AND (age='kids' OR age='all');

-- Looks like it's going to be LEGO then!
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>name</td><td>price</td><td>age</td></tr>
		<tr><td>LEGO</td><td>12.50</td><td>all</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Plush Panda</td><td>75.00</td><td>kids</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Small Plush Panda</td><td>25.00</td><td>kids</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Playmobil</td><td>28.50</td><td>all</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Playstation</td><td>80.00</td><td>teenagers</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Keychain</td><td>5.00</td><td>adults</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h3>NULL Logic</h3>

<p>As we've seen before, the <code>NULL</code> value is common yet very special, and that's why it isn't so friendly towards our other operators. It requires its own syntax.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Operator</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>IS NULL</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the value is indeed <code>NULL</code></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>NOT IS NULL</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the value is indeed <em>not</em> <code>NULL</code></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Ginty, on the other hand, wants to read reviews first, before buying a product
SELECT name, price, reviews FROM products WHERE reviews NOT IS NULL;
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>name</td><td>price</td><td>reviews</td></tr>
		<tr><td>LEGO</td><td>12.50</td><td>4.6</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Plush Panda</td><td>75.00</td><td>5.0</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Small Plush Panda</td><td>25.00</td><td></td></tr>
		<tr><td>Playmobil</td><td>28.50</td><td>3.8</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Playstation</td><td>80.00</td><td>4.1</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Keychain</td><td>5.00</td><td></td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Fast Logic</h3>

<p>Writing lots of <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> operators is exhausting. Therefore, SQL provides several shorthand ways to perform logic you'll commonly need.</p>

<p>For example, say you have 10 administrators working on the website, and when somebody logs in you want to check the username to see if they are an admin. Then, you need to check the username against 10 different names. This is a pain with only general operators, but would be easy with the <code>IN</code> operator.</p>

<img src="media/SQLLogicOperators.png" />

<p>The fast and useful logic operators are:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Operator</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>ALL (<em>value_1</em>, <em>&hellip;</em>, <em>value_n</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the comparison is true for all values in the given set*</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>ANY (<em>value_1</em>, <em>&hellip;</em>, <em>value_n</em>)</code><br/>
				<code>SOME (<em>value_1</em>, <em>&hellip;</em>, <em>value_n</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the comparison is true for at least one value in the given set</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>BETWEEN <em>x</em> AND <em>y</em></code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the left operand is between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>IN (<em>value_1</em>, <em>&hellip;</em>, <em>value_n</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Returns true if the left operand is also somewhere within the given set</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>NOTE: *Sets are those comma-separated lists of values. Sets can also be the result of another query, but that's discussed in the <em>Subqueries</em> chapter.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Select all items that are not LEGO, Playmobil or Duplo
SELECT brand, price FROM products WHERE brand NOT IN ("LEGO", "Playmobil", "Duplo");
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>brand</td><td>price</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>LEGO</td><td>12.50</td></tr>

  title: "[SQL] Aliases & Variables"
  post: "<p>We've seen in all the previous chapters, that we can use the value inside a certain column by simply typing the column's name. For example, when selecting a user entry from a database based on the <em>username</em> column, we can just use a condition like <code>WHERE username = "PANDA"</code>.</p>

<p>Being able to easily access these values is great, but we want more. Instead of focusing on a single row at a time, we often want to see how the data is related across rows. For example, perhaps we want to count the amount of users that are female, or get the average age of all users. How to do all those fancy things will be discussed in later chapters, but in this chapter I want to introduce a tool you can use to simplify your life: <strong>aliases</strong>.</p>

<h2>Aliases</h2>

<p>An alias is an alternative name you can give to some data. For example, once we've counted the amount of female users in our table, we want to save that result in a name we can easily remember---such as <em>female_count</em>. While it's not mandatory, I recommend to always use aliases, as they make queries much clearer and faster (because you don't need to recalculate things).</p>

<p>To create an alias, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>some_expression</em> AS <em>some_alias_name</em></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Saves the value of price*discount under the alias of final_price
SELECT name, price*discount AS final_price FROM products;
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>name</td><td>final_price</td></tr>
		<tr><td>LEGO</td><td>18.67</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Plush Panda</td><td>56.77</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>Note that these aliases are only defined and available in that specific query. You can't create an alias for a certain expression, and expect it to still work with a new query a few days later. You're really just renaming a certain part of a query so that you can use it more easily elsewhere within the same query.</p>

<h2>Special Aliases</h2>

<p>Instead of merely saving a column or certain expression as an alias, we can also save a complete table under a different name. Now, you haven't actually seen ways to use multiple tables within the same query <em>yet</em>, but you will soon enough. For now, just remember that you can give a better name to such table with the following syntax:</p>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>some_table</em> <em>some_alias_name</em></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Example: Now we want to select all items from "products", plus the description of the category they belong to (which is saved in another table "categories")
SELECT prod.name, prod.price*prod.discount AS final_price, cat.description
FROM products prod
INNER JOIN categories cat
ON prod.cat_id = cat.id
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>name</td><td style="white-space:pre;">final_price</td><td>description</td></tr>
		<tr><td>LEGO</td><td>18.67</td><td>LEGO is a brand of blocks from Norway...</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Plush Panda</td><td>56.77</td><td>WWF has been making plush toys of high quality since...</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>NOTE: If you ever encounter an SQL query in the wild that you don't understand, it's more than likely there's multiple tables being renamed. Because the syntax is so easy and quick, it's also easy to overlook it.</p>

<p>Do not, however, fall into the trap of giving your tables the shortest names imaginable (such as <code>a</code> or <code>b</code>). Try to always provide clear and descriptive names for aliases that actually <em>help</em> you understand and write the query, not ones that merely make it shorter.</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>Instead of renaming data we already have, SQL, like any proper computer language, can also save new data inside <strong>variables</strong>! Variables are nothing more than data containers---you choose a name and data type, and assign a certain value to the variable. This way, if needed, we can create and save strings of text, numbers, anything you want.</p>

<p>To create a variable, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">DECLARE @<em>variable_name type</em>;</code>

<p>Yes, this <em>type</em> can be any of the data types your particular database system supports. So, for example, if you set it to <code>varchar(10)</code>, you can save any piece of text of at most 10 characters inside this variable.</p>

<p>To set a variable to the value you want, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SET @<em>variable_name</em> = <em>desired_value</em>;</code>

<p>To use the variable, simply type the name wherever you want to insert the variable's value.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Our boss has gone mad and wants to increase all our prices by a different random factor every day!
DECLARE @random_num FLOAT(5,3);
SET @random_num = 2.25;

SELECT name, price*discount*random_num AS final_price FROM products;
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>name</td><td>final_price</td></tr>
		<tr><td>LEGO</td><td>42.0075</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Plush Panda</td><td>127.7325</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>If you have never used any other programming language before, this babble about variables may seem like bogus. In this case, I suggest you do not worry about this, as it is quite an advanced feature you won't regularly need. Nevertheless, I also suggest you learn about programming languages and variables as soon as possible, as they are the cornerstone of computer science! (Or, well, one of the big building blocks, at least.)</p>

  title: "[SQL] Aggregators"
  post: "<p>Now that we know how to create aliases for complex expressions, we of course need to work on creating those complex expressions. In the last chapter, I mentioned the example of counting the total amount of rows a certain query returned. When SQL does so, it essentially looks at all entries, and reduces their values to a single value---the total amount of rows, which is just one number. In other words, functions like these <em>aggregate</em> a set of rows into one value.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, they are called <strong>aggregators</strong>, or aggregate functions. The five aggregators are: <em>count</em>, <em>sum</em>, <em>average</em>, <em>maximum</em>, and <em>minimum</em>. Most databases also add a few aggregators of their own, but you'll need those far less often than the five fundamental aggregators.</p>

<h2>Count</h2>

<p>The <strong>count</strong> aggregator counts the amount of entries that you've selected. You can, however, slightly modify how it will count those rows.</p>

<p>To count <em>all</em> the rows, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">COUNT(*)</code>

<p>To count the amount of rows of a certain column that have a meaningful value, which just means it does <em>not</em> count <code>NULL</code> values, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">COUNT(<em>column_name</em>)</code>

<p>Additionally, you can tell SQL to only count rows that are <em>different</em>. In other words, to only count the amount of rows with distinct values, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">COUNT(DISTINCT <em>column_name</em>)</code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Counts the amount of users
SELECT username, COUNT(*) AS user_amount FROM users;

-- Notice how the username column also has only on value - with an aggregate function, this is always the value of the last column that was counted.
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>username</td><td>user_amount</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Juan</td><td>43</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>NOTE: This <code>DISTINCT</code> keyword can also be used with all the other aggregators, and at some other places, which I'll discuss later.</p>

<h2>Sum</h2>

<p>The <strong>sum</strong> aggregator calculates the sum of all values in a certain column. Again, <code>NULL</code> values are omitted. (In a sense, they have the value <code>0</code> in the summation.) The syntax is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SUM(<em>column_name</em>)
SUM(DISTINCT <em>column_name</em>)</code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Returns the sum of all the points scored by user Panda
SELECT username, SUM(points) AS points_total FROM users WHERE username = "Panda";
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>username</td><td>points</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>50</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Juan</td><td>15</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>50</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>25</td></tr>
	</table>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>username</td><td>points_total</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>125</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Average</h2>

<p>The <strong>average</strong> aggregator returns the average of all values in a certain column. The syntax is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">AVG(<em>column_name</em>)
AVG(DISTINCT <em>column_name</em>)</code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Calculate the average points earned per day by Panda
SELECT username, AVG(points) AS points_avg FROM users WHERE username = "Panda";
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>username</td><td>points_avg</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>41.67</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>NOTE: Essentially, this is a shorthand method for calculating the total <em>sum</em> of the values, and dividing that by the <em>count</em>. Because, if you remember from math classes, average = sum/(amount of items).</p>

<h2>Minimum</h2>

<p>The <strong>minimum</strong> aggregator returns the minimum of a column---the smallest value of all values. The syntax is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">MIN(<em>column_name</em>)
MIN(DISTINCT <em>column_name</em>)</code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Since this year, students are not allowed to have any grade below 4.0. Let's check if Panda and Juan are allowed to pass!
SELECT username, MIN(grade) AS min_grade FROM users GROUP BY username;

-- The GROUP BY statement at the end simply groups the results, don't worry about it for now
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>username</td><td>grade</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>6.7</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Juan</td><td>8.2</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>5.8</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Juan</td><td>3.8</td></tr>
	</table>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>username</td><td>min_grade</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>5.8</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Juan</td><td>3.8</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Maximum</h2>

<p>The <strong>maximum</strong> aggregator returns the maximum of a column---the largest value of all values. The syntax is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">MAX(<em>column_name</em>)
MAX(DISTINCT <em>column_name</em>)</code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- To ease the pain, professor Qi decided to reward the username with the highest grade with candy.
SELECT username, MAX(grade) AS max_grade FROM users GROUP BY username;
</pre>

  title: "[SQL] Sorting"
  post: "<p>Let's say you've crafted a nifty select statement that returns all the rows you want---how do you go about creating order out of this perhaps huge set of entries? Well, the way any structured person would organize his stuff. You collect everything you want to go through, divide it into groups, put them in a sensible order, and throw out everything you don't need.</p>

<p>For example, say you want to select the 10 latest blog posts from a table. In that case, you first <em>sort</em> the table by date (so that the latest posts come first in the results), and then tell SQL to ignore all entries that come after the first 10.</p>

<h2>Regular Ordering</h2>

<p>Sorting or <em>ordering</em> results in this way is not only useful when it comes to displaying the data in a sensible manner, it's also often necessary for performing certain queries. To order results of a select statement, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">ORDER BY <em>expression </em>[ASC | DESC]</code>

<p>The expression, as always, can contain any column names or aliases you have. You need to put either the keyword <code>ASC</code> <em>or</em> <code>DESC</code> behind the expression. The first one orders results <em>ascending</em> (low to high), the second does so <em>descending</em> (high to low).</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- This sorts the grades DESCENDING (from highest to lowest).
SELECT * FROM grades ORDER BY grade DESC;

-- Note how this only influences the results we selected; the original table still has the same "order", namely the primary key id
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>username</td><td>grade</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Panda</td><td>8.5</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Juan</td><td>7.6</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>Ginty</td><td>7.1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Fluffykins</td><td>5.9</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Lexicographical Ordering</h2>

<p>Lexicographical ordering simply refers to the type of ordering used in dictionaries. First, words are ordered based on the first letter. Then, if the first letter is the same, words are ordered based on the second letter. If the second letter is also the same, they are ordered based on the third letter---and so on.</p>

<p>Instead of supplying only a single expression, we can supply as many as we want. SQL will first order based on the first expression, but if multiple entries have the same value, it will order based on the second expression. To do so, simply use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">ORDER BY <em>expression </em>[ASC | DESC], <em>&hellip;</em>, <em>expression </em>[ASC | DESC]</code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- This sorts the grades DESCENDING, and if the grade is the same, the usernames ASCENDING (which is just alphabetical order)
SELECT * FROM grades ORDER BY grade DESC, username ASC;
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>username</td><td>grade</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Juan</td><td>8.5</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Panda</td><td>8.5</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>Ginty</td><td>7.1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Jean Valjean</td><td>5.9</td></tr>
		<tr><td>5</td><td>Aladin</td><td>5.6</td></tr>
		<tr><td>6</td><td>Tigres</td><td>5.6</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Advanced Ordering</h2>

<p>Additionally, you can also use those <em>aggregators</em> from last chapter within the expression. However, the main feature of aggregators was that they reduce to a single value---and how do you order a single value?</p>

<p>We will look into that more intensively in a few chapters, but the main idea is that you can let SQL divide the results into groups before you start ordering. So, you can group the results based on some condition, and then order the <em>groups</em> instead of all individual entries. This way, using aggregators makes sense. You could, for example, divide a table containing blog posts into groups based on category, and then order these groups based on how many posts are within that category.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Quick Example: This result isn't so interesting... (the ORDER BY has no function whatsoever)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS high_grades FROM grades WHERE grade > 7 ORDER BY grade DESC;

-- ...but this is. It shows the amount of students that got the same grade, ordered from high to low
SELECT grade, COUNT(*) AS group_num FROM grades GROUP BY grade ORDER BY grade DESC;
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>high_grades</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>grade</td><td>group_num</td></tr>
		<tr><td>8.5</td><td>2</td></tr>
		<tr><td>7.1</td><td>1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>5.9</td><td>1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>5.6</td><td>2</td></tr>
	</table>

  title: "[SQL] Grouping"
  post: "<p>Now that we know how to select entries based on conditions and expressions, and how to establish some order amongst them, we can start <em>grouping</em> the results. Notice that grouping is very different from <em>filtering</em> (discussed in next chapter). When grouping results, we're collecting all the results and putting them into larger or smaller groups. When filtering results, we're simply throwing out all the information we don't need.</p>

<p>We'll also see in this chapter that the order of the keywords is, in fact, very important in SQL. Intuitively, we understand that you can't place an <code>ORDER BY</code> statement at the start of a <code>SELECT</code> statement, because there would be nothing to order yet. But, for example, we will also see that there's a good reason that the <code>GROUP BY</code> keyword must come before the <code>ORDER BY</code> keyword.</p>

<h2>Group By</h2>

<p>The <code>GROUP BY</code> keyword is extremely powerful, especially when used in combination with aggregators. Not only does it group entries for you, based on certain conditions, it's also smart enough to apply the aggregator function per group. Essentially, it compresses multiple entries from the same group, into one entry containing relevant information about the whole group.</p>

<p>The syntax is</p>

<code class="longsyntax">GROUP BY <em>expression</em>,<em> &hellip;</em>,<em> expression</em></code>

<p>It will group entries together if they have the same value for all the expressions. For example, you could group entries in a <em>movies</em> table if the average rating <em>and</em> genre are the same. Usually though, one expression is more than enough.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Count the amount of users, grouped by gender
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS amount FROM users GROUP BY gender;
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>username</td><td>gender</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda</td><td>male</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Ginty</td><td>female</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Juan</td><td>male</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>Gandalf</td><td>male</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>gender</td><td>amount</td></tr>
		<tr><td>male</td><td>3</td></tr>
		<tr><td>female</td><td>1</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>The <code>GROUP BY</code> keyword directly follows the <code>WHERE</code> statement of a query. The reason for this, is that you want to group the results immediately---you can't order the results first, and then group them, because grouping undoes the ordering.</p>

<h2>Union</h2>

<p>Alternatively, instead of chopping up results into smaller groups, we can combine results into bigger groups! Instead of only selecting data from one table, we can chain as many small <code>SELECT</code> statements as we want, and combine the results before we group them, or sort them, or do anything else with them. In other words, we can unite different results from several places with the <code>UNION</code> keyword.</p>

<p>I say <em>small</em> select statements, because you're only allowed to use the simplest form of the select query before the <code>UNION</code> keyword; the SELECT-FROM-WHERE format. Therefore, the general syntax is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT <em>__</em> FROM <em>__</em> WHERE <em>__</em>
UNION
SELECT <em>__</em> FROM <em>__</em> WHERE <em>__</em>
<em>other keywords or operations here</em></code>

<p>You can create a union from as many select statements as you want, as long as you adhere to the SELECT-FROM-WHERE format. (Or, you can use subqueries, but those are so powerful that I've given them their own huge chapter near the end of the course.)</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Say we have an online game where each game world has its own table. Then we can count all the users
SELECT username, points FROM world_one

UNION

SELECT username, points FROM world_two

ORDER BY points DESC
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>username</td><td>points</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda</td><td>255</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Ginty</td><td>125</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>username</td><td>points</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Juan</td><td>60</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Gandalf</td><td>1000</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>username</td><td>points</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Gandalf</td><td>1000</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>255</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Ginty</td><td>125</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Juan</td><td>60</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p><em>Why can't I use other keywords before the <code>UNION</code> keyword?</em> Because, in every SQL query, you first need to select all your data before you can perform any special actions on it (such as grouping, sorting, and more). So, just as with grouping, you first need to unite all the data you could possibly need, and only later in the query can you sort them.</p>

<h2>Union All</h2>

<p>The regular <code>UNION</code> keyword, by default, only combines distinct rows. In other words, if it finds two entries that are the same, it will throw out one of them. This is often what you want---remember, <em>identical rows are evil!</em>---however, if you want to keep those duplicate rows, use</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT <em>__</em> FROM <em>__</em> WHERE <em>__</em>
UNION ALL
SELECT <em>__</em> FROM <em>__</em> WHERE <em>__</em>
<em>other keywords or operations here</em></code>

  title: "[SQL] Filtering"
  post: "<p>Continuing in the spirit of last chapter, we will now look at ways to limit your data set. Often, a query returns more results than you need, and there's no way to change that with a simple condition. Instead, even more awesome keywords can be used to filter out the right results!</p>

<h2>Intersect &amp; Except</h2>

<p>As opposed to combining data sets using the <code>UNION</code> keyword (discussed in last chapter), we can also reduce the amount of entries by checking them against another set. This means that we <em>compare</em> entries from multiple <code>SELECT</code> statements, and keep an entry only if some condition is satisfied.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To keep an entry only if it appears in both tables, use the <code>INTERSECT</code> keyword.</li>
	<li>To keep an entry only if it <em>doesn't</em> appear in both tables, use the <code>EXCEPT</code> keyword.</li>
</ul>

<img src="media/SQLIntersectExcept.png" />

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Looking at our online game again, we want to select all users that have explored both worlds
SELECT username FROM world_one

INTERSECT

SELECT username FROM world_two
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>username</td><td>points</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda</td><td>255</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Ginty</td><td>125</td></tr>

	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>username</td><td>points</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Juan</td><td>60</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Panda</td><td>300</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Gandalf</td><td>1000</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>username</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Gandalf</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>NOTE: These keywords are available in all systems, except for MySQL. Do not fret, however, as you can recreate how they work with some <em>joins </em>magic (explained in a later chapter).</p>

<h2>Distinct</h2>

<p>Up until now, the <code>SELECT</code> keyword has been quite lonely in all our queries, with no keywords near it. You might have silently accepted that this is just the way the syntax works, but, surprise surprise, it can actually have the <code>DISTINCT</code> keyword after it!</p>

<p>Without it, the default behaviour is that the statement selects all information, as you've seen. With the <code>DISTINCT</code> keyword after it, the select statement only selects <em>unique</em> rows, no matter what query magic comes after it. So, the general syntax becomes:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT DISTINCT <em>__</em>
FROM <em>__</em>
WHERE <em>__</em>
<em>other operations here</em></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- We want to show all the different cheap products in our store. However, lots of items have multiple versions (such as a black and a white laptop case), but we want to count those as only one.
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM products WHERE price <= 100
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>name</td><td>price</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>LEGO</td><td>20.50</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>LEGO</td><td>15.50</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Laptop</td><td>599.99</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>The Hobbit</td><td>12.99</td></tr>
		<tr><td>5</td><td>Laptop</td><td>499.99</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>name</td></tr>
		<tr><td>LEGO</td></tr>
		<tr><td>The Hobbit</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Having</h2>

<p>Many, many times we've used the powerful <code>WHERE</code> keyword to filter our results. Now that we can also group the results, however, we need another keyword to filter the <em>groups</em>. To avoid confusion, SQL doesn't use the same keyword again, but instead uses the <code>HAVING</code> keyword.</p>

<p>For example, say you have a web shop with a table containing products, and you want to provide a list of the best-rated categories. Therefore, you only want to display the categories with a rating higher than 90%. To do so, you select everything from the database, group them by the average rating, and then remove all groups that have a rating that's too low.</p>

<p>The <code>HAVING</code> keyword must always follow a <code>GROUP BY</code> statement, and provides conditions that determine which groups are kept and which are thrown away. Therefore, the syntax is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT <em>__</em> FROM <em>__</em> WHERE <em>__ </em>
GROUP BY <em>__</em>
HAVING <em>conditions</em></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Alternatively, we could do this (to also count the amount of versions we have per product)
SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS amount, MIN(price) AS min_price
FROM products 
GROUP BY name

HAVING min_price < 100
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>name</td><td>price</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>LEGO</td><td>20.50</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>LEGO</td><td>15.50</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Laptop</td><td>599.99</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>The Hobbit</td><td>12.99</td></tr>
		<tr><td>5</td><td>Laptop</td><td>499.99</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>name</td><td>amount</td><td>min_price</td></tr>
		<tr><td>LEGO</td><td>2</td><td>15.50</td></tr>
		<tr><td>The Hobbit</td><td>1</td><td>12.99</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>So, instead of filtering results upfront (like <code>WHERE</code>), it filters the groups after they've been formed.</p>

<h2>Limiting</h2>

<p>Last but certainly not least, we can throw out entries based on their position in the results. Once we've ordered our results, we can say things like "pick only the first 10 rows" or "pick rows 10-20". A very common application of limiting is selecting the latest 5 or 10 blog posts from a database.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, ideas about how to implement this differ vastly across systems. The syntax for selecting the first <em>X</em> amount of rows is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>&hellip;</em> ORDER BY <em>__</em> LIMIT <em>X</em><span class="extraInformation">SQLite<br/>MySQL<br/>PostgreSQL</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT TOP <em>X __</em> FROM <em>&hellip;</em><span class="extraInformation">SQL Server<br/>MS Access</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax">FROM <em>__</em> WHERE ROWNUM <= <em>X</em><span class="extraInformation">Oracle</span></code>

<p>NOTE: As you can see, besides the keyword itself, the placement of the keyword is also different.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Select the titles from the latest 3 blog posts
SELECT title FROM posts ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 3
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>title</td><td>post</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Hello World!</td><td>Hi...</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Test.</td><td>Just testing...</td></tr>

<h3>Pagination</h3>

<p>Another common application for limiting is creating a paginated website. Once the user has reached the bottom of the page, he can click on a button to go to the next page, which will display the next 10 posts or results from the database. (Of course, there are many more uses for this SQL technique.)</p>

<p>Essentially, you want to select the first <em>X</em> rows, starting from position <em>Y</em>. The syntax is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">LIMIT <em>X</em> OFFSET <em>Y</em>
LIMIT <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em><span class="extraInformation">SQLite<br/>MySQL<br/>PostgreSQL</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax">OFFSET <em>Y</em> ROWS FETCH NEXT <em>X</em> ROWS ONLY<span class="extraInformation">SQL Server, MS Access</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax">(ROWNUM >= <em>Y</em> AND ROWNUM <= (<em>X+Y</em>))<span class="extraInformation">Oracle</span></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- On page 2, select the titles from the latest 3-6 blog posts
SELECT title FROM posts ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 3,3
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>title</td><td>post</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Hello World!</td><td>Hi...</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Test.</td><td>Just testing...</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Test Again.</td><td>Grumpf...</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>Finally, it works.</td><td>Yay!...</td></tr>
		<tr><td>5</td><td>Blog Post #1</td><td>Welcome every...</td></tr>
		<tr><td>5</td><td>Blog Post #2</td><td>Today I want...</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>title</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Test Again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Test.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Hello World!</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>NOTE: As you can see, the syntax for pagination is extremely easy in MySQL and the like, but not in the other systems. Therefore, you can usually achieve much better performance by implementing this in another way, using subqueries. Again. Really, subqueries are important.</p>

  title: "[SQL] Joins I"
  post: "<p>All the queries and fancy keywords we've used thus far, were mainly used on single tables. Sure, we learnt how to combine select statements to get much larger data sets from multiple tables. That's only one of many ways, however, to create queries that work with multiple tables. Instead of mixing <em>everything</em> together, it's far more common to only combine data sets on rows that have something in common, or only include extra entries based on a certain condition, and so on.</p>

<p>For working with many entries from many different places, we use <strong>joins</strong>. Many different types of joins exist, and I will explain them from simplest to most complex.</p>

<h2>Cross Join</h2>

<p>The <strong>cross join</strong> simply joins <em>every</em> row from one table, with <em>every </em>row from another table. If you remember anything from mathematics, you might know this as a <em>Cartesian product</em>, commonly denoted with a cross (&times;). Not surprisingly, it's also called the <strong>Cartesian join</strong>.</p>

<p>So, if you have one table with 10 rows and 2 columns, and another with 5 rows and 2 columns, the result will be a data set with 50 rows and 4 columns.</p>

<img src="media/SQLCrossJoin.png" />

<p>To create a cross join, use one of these syntaxes</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT * FROM <em>table1</em>, <em>table2</em>
SELECT * FROM <em>table1</em> CROSS JOIN <em>table2</em></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Say we're writing a program that randomly combines sentences, just for fun
-- CONCAT simply puts the strings together, don't worry about it for now
SELECT CONCAT(front, back) AS sentence

FROM front_sentences 

CROSS JOIN back_sentences
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>front</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Mike went swimming...</td></tr>
		<tr><td>He borrowed a duck...</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>back</td></tr>
		<tr><td>because he was lonely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>because it was his mission.</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>sentence</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Mike went swimming...because he was lonely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Mike went swimming...because it was his mission.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>He borrowed a duck...because he was lonely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>He borrowed a duck...because it was his mission.</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>Usually, this join is a bit over the top---you'll likely only need a small set of those rows you're selecting. Either way, it's the simplest join there is if you want to play around with joins.</p>

<h2>Inner Join</h2>

<p>An <strong>inner join</strong> is essentially a cross join with conditions added. It doesn't combine <em>all</em> rows, but only rows that fulfil a certain condition. So, it selects a subset of the cross join, or an <em>inner part</em> of the full data set---hence the name.</p>

<img src="media/SQLInnerJoin.png" />

<p>An inner join can be performed <em>implicitly</em>, which means you're playing with rows from multiple tables at the same time and trusting SQL to do the right thing, or <em>explicitly</em>, by using a keyword.</p>

<h3>Implicit</h3>

<p>One powerful feature of SQL, is that we can easily access anything from any table within the database. This is done with the <strong>dot notation</strong>:</p>

<code class="longsyntax"><em>someTable</em>.<em>someColumn</em></code>

<p>We can use this notation to work with data from multiple tables at the same time, without having to explicitly join anything. All we need to do is include a <code>WHERE</code> clause, using the dot notation, that states which rows we should combine.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Combine comments with information about the user
SELECT users.username AS usn, 
       comments.comment AS cmt
FROM users, comments

WHERE usn = comments.user_id
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>username</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Panda</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Ginty</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Juan</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>user_id</td><td>comment</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>I like to move it, move it</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>This is a test comment.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>Dragons are awesome!</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>usn</td><td>cmt</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>I like to move it, move it</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Juan</td><td>This is a test comment.</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>NOTE: This notation can also be used at any other place within the query, because it isn't really any different from the column names we've been using thus far. It simply selects a column from a foreign table, nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<h3>Explicit</h3>

<p>The alternative syntax for inner joins, which is less flexible but often makes the query more readable, is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT __ FROM <em>table1</em>
INNER JOIN <em>table2
</em>ON <em>conditions</em></code>

<p>Note that we must still use the dot notation---it's just that the join itself and the corresponding condition have their own syntax.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- This does exactly the same as the previous example
SELECT users.username AS usn, 
       comments.comment AS cmt
FROM users
INNER JOIN comments
ON usn = comments.user_id
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>usn</td><td>cmt</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>I like to move it, move it</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Juan</td><td>This is a test comment.</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Biased Joins</h2>

<p>We've seen the cross join that selects <em>everything</em>, and the inner join that only selects rows if they match a certain condition in <em>both tables</em>. That's nice and fair, but what if we want the query to be biased, and select results from one table differently than from the other? We can use what I call <strong>biased joins</strong>.</p>

<img src="media/SQLBiasedJoins.png" />

<h3>Left Join</h3>

<p>The <strong>left join</strong> selects <em>all</em> rows from the first table, but only the rows that match the conditions from the second table. Therefore, there will be rows from the first table that don't have a matching row in the second. If that's the case, it fills in <code>NULL</code> values for those columns. Use one of these syntaxes:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT __ FROM <em>table1</em> LEFT JOIN <em>table2</em>
SELECT __ FROM <em>table1</em> LEFT OUTER JOIN <em>table2</em></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Using the same tables as previous examples, a left join instead of inner join would give these results
SELECT users.username AS usn, 
       comments.comment AS cmt
FROM users

LEFT JOIN comments
ON usn = comments.user_id
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>usn</td><td>cmt</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>I like to move it, move it</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Ginty</td><td></td></tr>
		<tr><td>Juan</td><td>This is a test comment.</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Right Join</h3>

<p>The <strong>right join</strong> selects only the rows that match the conditions from the first table, but <em>all</em> rows from the second table. So, it's a reversed left join. Use one of these syntaxes:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT __ FROM <em>table1</em> RIGHT JOIN <em>table2</em>
SELECT __ FROM <em>table1</em> RIGHT OUTER JOIN <em>table2</em></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- If we turn around the table order, a right join would do exactly the same as the previous left join
SELECT users.username AS usn, 
       comments.comment AS cmt
FROM comments

RIGHT JOIN users
ON usn = comments.user_id
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>usn</td><td>cmt</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>I like to move it, move it</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Ginty</td><td></td></tr>
		<tr><td>Juan</td><td>This is a test comment.</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Full Join</h3>

<p>The <strong>full join</strong> is a combination of the left and right join.</p>

<p><em>What's the difference with a cross join or inner join?</em> The full join uses <em>every</em> row from the first table, and <em>every</em> row from the right table (like a cross join). However, if it finds two rows that match the provided conditions, it will combine them (just like an inner join). If it can't find a matching row from the other table, it will fill in <code>NULL</code> values for all the other columns (like left and right joins).</p>

<p>So, it will include every row from the first table <em>only once</em>, and every row from the second table <em>only once</em>. And, if possible, it will combine rows.</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT __ FROM <em>table1</em> FULL OUTER JOIN <em>table2</em></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Combine comments with information about the user
SELECT users.username AS usn, 
       comments.comment AS cmt
FROM users

FULL JOIN comments
ON usn = comments.user_id
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>usn</td><td>cmt</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Panda</td><td>I like to move it, move it</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Ginty</td><td></td></tr>
		<tr><td>Juan</td><td>This is a test comment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td>Dragons are awesome!</td></tr>
	</table>

  title: "[SQL] Joins II"
  post: "<p>Joins are so powerful and important, that they deserve a second chapter! The previous chapter outlined all the types of joins---there is no other way to combine two data sets. So, this chapter will look at what to do if you don't have two data sets, but only one or more than two.</p>

<p>If a table joins on itself, we call it a <strong>self join</strong>. If you chain more than one join, so that at least three tables are being joined, I like to call it a <strong>multi join</strong>.</p>

<p><em>When would I use this advanced joining wizardry?</em> Well, say you're running a university, and you have a system with tables <em>students</em>, <em>grades</em>, and <em>courses</em>. You want to get the amount of ECTS ("study points") that a certain student has earned, and email her this information. Then you need the email address from the students table, the grade from the grades table, <em>and</em> the amount of study points the course gives from the courses table.</p>

<h2>Self Join</h2>

<p>Joining a table with itself might seem obvious---just use an inner join with the same table. While that is indeed how a self join can be made, there's one problem: how do you distinguish the first instance of the table with the second one, if they both have the same name?</p>

<p>That's where those handy table aliases come into play! When working with self joins, always make sure you give useful and distinct names to your tables and expressions. Otherwise, you quickly lose focus of what you're trying to do, and SQL will lose focus too.</p>

<p>NOTE: In fact, it's always best to properly name the components of your query in joins, or any situation you're working with data from lots of different places.</p>

<p>So, to get the full picture, look at the following example. It demonstrates a typical use case of self joins: when a table references data within itself.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Say we have a categories table that uses multiple levels; one category can be the subcategory of another. This is how we could get the name of the parent category of every subcategory.
SELECT first.name AS parent, second.name AS category
FROM categories first

INNER JOIN categories second
ON second.subcat_id = first.id

-- the WHERE statement, and other keywords, come after the joining process
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>name</td><td>subcat_id</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>News</td><td></td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Local</td><td>1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Blog</td><td>1</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>parent</td><td>category</td></tr>
		<tr><td>News</td><td>Local</td></tr>
		<tr><td>News</td><td>Blog</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Multi Join</h2>

<p>Similarly, chaining multiple joins is nothing more than using the same syntax over and over.</p>

<p>The only thing that might create problems, is the placement and usage of the <code>ON</code> keyword. With multiple joins, you can't separate the <code>JOIN</code> keyword and the <code>ON</code> keyword. Instead, the syntax for one join needs to stay together, like this:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT __ FROM <em>table1</em>
JOIN <em>table2</em> ON <em>condition</em>
JOIN <em>table3</em> ON <em>condition</em>
<em>lots of other keywords and expressions here</em></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- We have three tables: movie titles, actors linked to movie titles, and actor names
SELECT 
	movies.id AS movie_id, 
	movies.title AS title,
	CONCAT(actors.firstname,' ',actors.lastname) AS name
FROM movies

INNER JOIN movie_actors
ON movies.id = movie_actors.movie_id

INNER JOIN actors
ON actors.id = movie_actors.actor_id
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>title</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Inception</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Harry Potter and the Goblin on Fire</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Lord of the Rings</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>actor_id</td><td>movie_id</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable helperDatabaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>firstname</td><td>lastname</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Ian</td><td>McKellen</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Daniel</td><td>Radcliffe</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Leonardo</td><td>diCaprio</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>movie_id</td><td>title</td><td>name</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Inception</td><td>Leonardo diCaprio</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Harry Potter and the Goblin on Fire</td><td>Daniel Radcliffe</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>Lord of the Rings</td><td>Ian McKellen</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>It's also important to note that the <em>condition</em> you use theoretically has no problem with using data from tables you'll be joining later. As long as you use the dot notation, you could use something from <em>table3</em> in the condition for <em>table2</em>. However, I don't see how this could ever be put to practice (without making the code a complete mess), so I suggest you really keep joins separate. A single join should add rows from a new table, based on a condition using the new table and all previous tables.</p>

<h2>A Note on Joins</h2>

<p>Joins have many uses, but that also makes them prone to abuse.</p>

<p>First of all, check if you really need to use a join. Sometimes a simple <code>WHERE</code> statement or something else we've learned can replace it, and is much simpler and faster. On the other hand, if you're writing a complex query, check if you can't use a join instead. For example, subqueries can take over all the functionality of joins, but they are more tedious to write and much slower to execute.</p>

<p>Secondly, check if you really need that many rows or columns. Most developers are lazy, and they just select everything and forget that they're not going to use half of it. Don't be that kind of guy (or girl). Most databases need to perform lots of complex queries during the day---if you can reduce the complexity and increase the speed, you're doing yourself a big favour.</p>

  title: "[SQL] Searching"
  post: "<p>I don't think I need to explain the importance of this topic to you. Search engines. Searching through a website. There will be times when you don't know <em>exactly</em> where you can find the entries you need, and in those cases, you want to write conditions to "vaguely match" against entries in your database. I say vaguely match, because searching is nothing more than checking if values from the database look somewhat like a search value the user provided. It's up to you how lenient your database is, what it searches through, and how it assigns importance to the results.</p>

<h2>Simple Search</h2>

<p>The simplest type of searching is simply checking if the value of a column matches a certain pattern. For example, if we want to find all blog posts that have the tag <em>"news"</em>, we can perform a simple search for entries where the column <em>tags</em> contains the string "<em>news"</em>.</p>

<p>For this, we use the <code>LIKE</code> operator. Notice that it's an operator, not a keyword, so it is used in conditions, and can be inverted:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT __ FROM <em>__</em> WHERE <em>column</em> LIKE<em> some_pattern</em>
SELECT __ FROM <em>__</em> WHERE <em>column</em> NOT LIKE<em> some_pattern </em></code>

<p>However, notice that I'm using the word <em>pattern</em> here. If we knew the exact value we were looking for, we wouldn't need the <code>LIKE</code> operator---instead, we could have just used the <code>=</code> operator. So, in our example, we're not looking for the exact string "<em>news</em>", but rather for any string that <em>contains</em> the word "news". To accomplish this, we use <strong>wildcards</strong>.</p>

<p>A wildcard is a symbol that stands for <em>everything that resembles what I'm looking for</em>. We've already seen one wildcard character, the asterisk ( <code>*</code> ), which was used to select <em>all rows from this table</em>. Within searches, we can use two more wildcards:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Wildcard</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>_</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Matches any <em>single</em> character</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>%</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Matches any <em>sequence</em> of characters---zero, one, or more.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Select all posts with a title that talks about cats
SELECT id, title FROM posts
WHERE title LIKE "%cat%" OR title LIKE "%Cat%"
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>title</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Big cats you are beautiful.</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>2</td><td>Another panda has been rescued!</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>3</td><td>Warning: storm at sea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>Look at this cute cat!</td></tr>
		<tr><td>5</td><td>Cats; what we know about them.</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>NOTE: As you can see, you can use as many wildcards as you want, or none at all.</p>

<h2>Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>If that is not enough for your searching needs, you can use <strong>regular expressions</strong>. These are extremely flexible and powerful, and will be able to do just about anything you'd ever want. They are also complicated, however, and I will not explain how regular expressions themselves work. Their syntax is the same across all programming languages, so there's no need to go in-depth in this SQL tutorial.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I do need to tell you the syntax for using a regular expression in SQL. Instead of the <code>LIKE</code> operator, you can simply use a different operator (mostly <code>REGEXP</code>):</p>

<code class="longsyntax">WHERE <em>column</em> REGEXP <em>some_regular_expression</em><span class="extraInformation">MySQL<br/>SQLite</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax">WHERE <em>column</em> SIMILAR TO <em>some_regular_expression</em><span class="extraInformation">PostgreSQL</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax">WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(<em>column</em>, some<em>_regular_expression</em>)<span class="extraInformation">Oracle</span></code>

<p><em>SQL Server</em> and <em>MS Access</em> already support regular expressions using the <code>LIKE</code> operator.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Select all posts with a title that does not contain any numbers
SELECT id, title FROM posts
WHERE title REGEXP "[^0-9]+"
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>title</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Big cats you are beautiful.</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>2</td><td>Panda #11 has been rescued!</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>3</td><td>Warning: sea storm level at 10.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>Look at this cute cat!</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>5</td><td>Cats; what we know about them, and why they have 9 lives.</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Full text Search</h2>

<p>Even though simple searches, with wildcards and regular expressions, are very powerful, they also lack a lot of useful features. For example, when we find an entry that matches, we can't really determine the relevance of the match. Or, when we're searching through extremely large pieces of text, the queries can become very slow.</p>

<p>To solve this, databases have something called <strong>full text search</strong>. The problem is that it's implemented almost completely differently in every system, so I'll try to explain the concept here, and you should be able to find specific syntax or functions for full text search in your particular system.</p>

<p>A full text search works in two steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The database indexes the words within the columns you're looking for. This works just like an index in a regular book---it creates a list of every word and in what entries it occurs. Additionally, in this step, you can use some functions or keywords to tell your database to be smart. For example, you could tell it to group related or similar words together, such as "mice" and "mouse".</li>
	<li>With the index created, searching for certain expressions is quick and easy. All you need to do is provide the expression you're searching for, and perhaps provide ways to rank the results of how lenient you want to be. The database then looks in the index, finds every word that fits, selects every entry that is connected to it, and returns that.</li>
</ol>

<img src="media/SQLFulltextSearch.png" />

<p>NOTE: You'll learn later how to create these kinds of indexes yourself---they can really save your life.</p>

<p>As said earlier, how systems implement this differs vastly. Some systems have an easy general syntax:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">WHERE MATCH(<em>col_1</em>,<em> &hellip;</em>,<em> col_n</em>) AGAINST (<em>search expressions, etcetera</em>)<span class="extraInformation">MySQL<br/>SQLite</span></code>

<code class="longsyntax">WHERE CONTAINS(<em>search expressions, conditions, functions, etcetera</em>)<span class="extraInformation">SQL Server<br/>Oracle</span></code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Searches all the posts, and selects the ones that mention something related to javascript objects
-- It also orders the results based on relevance
SELECT id, title FROM articles

WHERE MATCH(post) AGAINST('javascript objects')

ORDER BY MATCH(post) AGAINST('javascript objects')
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>id</td><td>title</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>[JavaScript] Objects II</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>[JavaScript] Objects I</td></tr>
		<tr><td>7</td><td>Object-Oriented Programming</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>2</td><td>Introduction to JavaScript</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>1</td><td>The Pandas and their Whereabouts; Part 2</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>NOTE: <em>MS Access</em> doesn't support full text search, <em>PostgreSQL</em> does but requires a lot more advanced SQL knowledge to pull off.</p>

  title: "[SQL] Functions"
  post: "<p>One of the most important aspects of any programming language, is number and string manipulation. Every language has lots of functionality for extracting the information you want from a number or string, and SQL is no different. For example, one day you might decide that you want to replace all occurrences of the word "client" with "user" across the whole database. Or, you might change the system of your movie website to store ratings as integers between 0 and 10, instead of decimal numbers between 1 and 5. Obviously, you don't want to spend countless days changing every single entry---luckily, functions allow you to execute a single query and be done with it.</p>

<p>Again, however, the available functions differ across systems, and there's only a handful of really useful functions that is supported by all. Needless to say, I will discuss those and leave the rest to you.</p>

<h2>Numeric</h2>

<p>Functions for numbers aren't necessarily very applicable in a website environment, but are insanely useful if you're analysing data from a database, or if you're running a game or other system that depends heavily on correct and precise numbers.</p>

<h2>String</h2>

<p>String functions, unlike numbers, are more applicable in the day-to-day situations you'll encounter when making a (simple) website. Typical uses are working with blog posts, descriptions, tags, comments, etcetera.</p>

<p>NOTE: In SQL, oddly enough, string indices start at 1. So, the first character in an SQL string has position 1. (Unlike other programming languages, which all start at 0).</p>

  title: "[SQL] Subqueries"
  post: "<p>I've mentioned subqueries quite a few times in this course, but I needed to explain other SQL concepts first, before subqueries would make sense to you. You might have already, from their name, made up some ideas about what they do, and you're probably right.</p>

> Subqueries are queries within queries

<p>Woah! Within a query, we can use the results of another query---a so-called <strong>subquery</strong>. The best thing is that this subquery doesn't require any alternative syntax, and you can nest them as deep as you like. If you wanted, you could place a subquery, within a subquery, within the main query.</p>

<img src="media/SQLSubqueries.png" />

<p><em>When would I use subqueries?</em> Typically, a subquery is used to get a single result from another table, so that we can use that in our main query.</p>

<p>For example, we might have a table <em>blog_posts</em> and another table <em>comments</em>. If we wanted to find all blog posts that received a higher than average amount of comments this month, we would need to do two things: calculate the average amount of comments this month from the <em>comments </em>table, and use that value to find all <em>blog_posts</em> with the amount of comments higher than that value. For the first step, we would need a subquery!</p>

<p>Subqueries, however, are more powerful than that, and can also be used to return a list of results---a <strong>data set</strong>. We saw in the <em>Operators</em> chapter that some operators (such as <code>IN</code>) require a data set instead of a specific value. Well, you can use a subquery for that too!</p>

<h2>The Syntax</h2>

<p>As I said earlier, subqueries use the exact same syntax as regular queries. However, we <em>do</em> need a way to tell SQL when our subquery ends and our main query continues. Because, if we don't, how does SQL know if a certain keyword belongs to the subquery or the main query?</p>

<p>Subqueries must, therefore, <em>always</em> be enclosed within <strong>parentheses</strong>. So, for example, the syntax of a simply subquery conditional is:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT __ FROM __ WHERE <em>some_val > </em>(<em>subquery</em>)</code>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- For our movie night, we want to select all movies with a higher than average rating
SELECT title, rating FROM movies WHERE rating > (SELECT AVG(rating) FROM movies)

-- Essentially, with the current table, this reads WHERE rating > 3.65
</pre>
<div>

	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>title</td><td>rating</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Inception</td><td>4.8</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Her</td><td>2.4</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Harry Potter (all)</td><td>4.4</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Bridge of Spies</td><td>4.2</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Fantastic Four</td><td>3.3</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Mean Girls</td><td>2.8</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>


<h2>Rules for Subqueries</h2>

<p>Subqueries are very flexible and can be just as complex as the main query, but there are some rules you must follow. More specifically, those rules must be followed if you don't want your whole program to break.</p>

<ul>
	<li>A subquery can only have, at most, the same amount of columns as the main query. This means that if you, for example, selected three columns in the main query, you can't select ten columns from another table with a subquery.</li>
	<li>The <code>ORDER BY</code> keyword cannot be used in subqueries, simply because the order of the results does not matter.</li>
	<li>Subqueries that return a single result can only be used with operators that expect a single value. Subqueries that return multiple results can only be used with operators that expect multiple values. For example, I can't compare a list of rows with a single number 5.</li>
	<li>Subqueries can't be too big, or the query will explode. This means that your subquery is not allowed to work with the largest data types your system has. (For example, for MySQL this means BLOB, or <em>Binary Large Object</em>.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Subqueries</h2>

<p>We typically distinguish two types of subqueries: <em>correlated</em> and <em>non-correlated</em>.</p>

<p>A <strong>correlated</strong> subquery contains values that depend on the main query. This means that the result of the subquery depends on which row is being evaluated in the main query.</p>

<p>A<strong> non-correlated</strong> subquery does <em>not</em> depend on values from the main query. It executes independently, and returns the same set of results for all entries.</p>

<p>As you can see, there's no difference in the syntax, it's just a difference in terminology and usage that I wanted to point out. When writing a subquery, simply know whether it should be correlated or not. Because, if the subquery depends on the main query, if one of them has a mistake or gives an error, the whole query blows up.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- The previous example was a non-correlated subquery. This one is correlated. It selects all users with more points than the average number of points, *depending* on their level.

SELECT * FROM users AS u
	WHERE points >= 
		(SELECT AVG(points) 
		 FROM users 
		 WHERE level = u.level)
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>username</td><td>points</td><td>level</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Juan</td><td>15</td><td>2</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Panda</td><td>10</td><td>2</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Ginty</td><td>25</td><td>2</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Gandalf</td><td>35</td><td>2</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Walt Disney</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Examples for the Confused</h2>

<p>Let me illustrate some more subquery magic, in case you're still not convinced of their importance, or it's still too abstract and complex for you.</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="sql">
-- Some hackers thought it would be fun to point out the bad players in our game, so they changed the bad user's names into NOOB.
UPDATE users SET username = 'NOOB' WHERE points <= (SELECT AVG(points) FROM users)
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>username</td><td>points</td><td>level</td></tr>
		<tr><td>NOOB</td><td>15</td><td>2</td></tr>
		<tr><td>NOOB</td><td>10</td><td>2</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Ginty</td><td>25</td><td>2</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Gandalf</td><td>35</td><td>2</td></tr>
		<tr><td>NOOB</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>I told you subqueries can be used for everything, and as you can see, that really means everything. You can use subqueries with all four CRUD operations, and instead of only using them with the <code>WHERE</code> keyword, you could also, for example, use them after the <code>SELECT</code> keyword.</p>

  title: "[SQL] Security & Optimization"
  post: "<p>I already scattered pieces of optimization wisdom throughout the course, because I think it's useful to start getting into that optimization habit early on. I, however, left out one very important aspect: <strong>security</strong>.</p>

<p>How do we make sure people don't hack into our databases? How do we make sure the passwords of millions of users are not stolen? Or that users don't "accidentally" change an SQL query to request information that's private? Lots of questions, lots of answers.</p>

<p>If you're the only one who's going to be accessing the database, you're fine as far as security goes---well, as long as you don't give other people the link to the database and your password.</p>

<p>If you are one of multiple administrators of the database, you can use <em>permissions</em> and set <em>user accounts</em> to control who can do what. (More on that in the advanced SQL course.)</p>

<p>However, if your users are going to be interacting with the database, you could be in a lot of trouble. And with interacting with the database, I mean that they could potentially modify any SQL query. For example, when a user logs into his or her account, the input he provides is used in the query---thus modifying the query. Or, when a user requests a certain blog post, he is modifying a general query to select only that particular post from the database.</p>

<p>All of this is pretty harmless, but if a user has malicious intent, they could do something called <strong>SQL injection</strong>---with devastating consequences!</p>

<h2>SQL Injection</h2>

<p>Imagine you have a site with users. Every user account is an entry in your <em>users</em> table, and users can log in via a simple form. So, to be able to check whether a username and password are correct, you'd do something like:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=inputName AND password=inputPass;</code>

<p>This query works fine, <em>until</em> somebody with good SQL knowledge decides to play with it. Instead of typing his password, he types (in the username field): <code>"" OR 1=1 --</code></p>

<p>Now, the query reads:</p>

<code class="longsyntax">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username="" OR 1=1;</code>

<p>Oh no, the password check has been removed! To make it worse, the condition <code>1=1</code> is always true, so the query returns <em>all </em>entries. Outrageous! Now the hacker knows all the usernames and passwords, and maybe has even more sensitive information.</p>

<p>This is SQL injection at its finest. An evil user might inject SQL code in a place where normal input is expected, and in doing so hack your system (without actually doing anything illegal).</p>

<p>To protect against this, people tried sanitizing the inputs. Before sending the query, the website checks whether the input contains any words or characters that are not allowed. But, this has two problems:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It takes a lot of work, and there will always be some cases you didn't think of.</li>
	<li>It heavily restricts the website's functionality. For example, to prevent against SQL injection commenting out parts of the query (with <code>--</code>), you could forbid hyphens. But, hyphens are quite essential to most (English) texts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, the only way to <em>really</em> protect your database, is using <strong>pre-processed queries</strong>.</p>

<h2>Pre-processed Queries</h2>

<p>A <em>pre-processed query</em> is a query whose general form has been saved, and only needs a few variables to be filled in. These variables also have a fixed type, such as a number or string of length 5.</p>

<img src="media/SQLPreparedStatements.png" />

<p>This way, all you need to do is replace the variables in the query with the user input, and send the query. If the user tries to give you illegal input, the query is simply not executed. Additionally, because the general form of the query is already determined beforehand, input can <em>never</em> mess with the SQL.</p>

<p>However, any web application that uses some kind of user interaction or input, also has to use a server-side language (such as the famous PHP). Pre-processing queries needs to be done with this server-side programming language, and can <em>not</em> be done with SQL only. Because I don't know what language you'll be using, I suggest you look up pre-processed queries in the documentation of your language to see how they work.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, to show you how they ought to work, I will give an example using the most popular server-side language (PHP):</p>

<div class="sideImagePreview">
<pre data-lang="php">
//This prepares the statement; it declares what is fixed, and where our variables (?) are
$statement = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");

//This fills in ("binds") the variables
$statement->bind_param("ss", $inputName, $inputPass);

$inputName = "Juan";
$inputPass = "juaniscool";

//This actually executes the query
$statement->execute()
</pre>
<div>
	<table class="databaseTable">
		<tr><td>username</td><td>password</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Juan</td><td>juaniscool</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Panda</td><td>1234</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Ginty</td><td>fluffybuffly</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Gandalf</td><td>eagles</td></tr>
		<tr class="unSelectedRow"><td>Juan</td><td>dinikskan</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Database &amp; Query Tuning</h2>

<p>Last but not least, some last tips on tuning your queries and databases for optimal performance. Most of these will probably be familiar to you, except for the first. I will explain it in detail after the list.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use 3NF database design.</li>
	<li>Avoid type conversions, especially number-to-character (or vice versa).</li>
	<li>Create <em>indexes</em> for extremely large tables, or tables you need to search through very often. If that's not the case, avoid indexes.</li>
	<li>Avoid pattern matching/searching and wildcards as much as you can. They often match too many rows, and are too slow.</li>
	<li>Avoid using the <code>OR</code>operator as much as you can. It slows down queries against any table of substantial size.</li>
	<li>Name your constraints, instead of directly attaching them to a specific column. It makes it easier to drop or alter it if needed, and it's more descriptive.</li>
	<li>Choose <code>JOIN</code>s over subqueries, and <code>WHERE</code> or <code>HAVING</code> clauses over <code>JOIN</code>s. When in doubt, simply test multiple versions of a query to see which one performs best.</li>
	<li>You're only allowed to discard 3NF database design (and therefore avoid database normalization and indexes), when working with bulk loads of data that need not be searched often (or at all).</li>
</ul>

<p>That odd acronym, <strong>3NF</strong>, stands for <em>third normal form</em>. As you expect, there's also a <strong>1NF</strong> (<em>first normal form</em>) and <strong>2NF</strong> (<em>second normal form</em>), from which it has been derived. Their definition is as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>1NF:</strong> All the data depends on the (primary) key. This means that columns are allowed to have duplicate values, as long as the entries are not exactly the same (which is the case if they all have a unique primary key value).</li>
	<li><strong>2NF:</strong> First normal form, plus the fact that all data depends on the <em>whole</em> primary key. For example, if your primary key is made up of two columns, a change in any of the two columns should mean a change in the column value.</li>
	<li><strong>3NF:</strong> Second normal form, plus the fact that all data depends on <em>nothing but</em> the primary key. This means that columns with identical values are not allowed, if the information can be derived from other columns that are not the key. Instead, those fields should reference a primary key from another table.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, essentially, you've finally learned the terminology and theory behind that database normalization I mentioned so often.</p>

  title: "[SQL] Conclusion: what now?"
  post: "<p>You've seen all the fundamental features of SQL, lots of advanced ones, and how to keep your databases fast and secure. Have you seen everything there is? No, certainly not. Is this already more than enough to get you going on your first projects? Yes, definitely.</p>

<p>I hope this course taught you what databases are, how insanely useful they are, and how you can create awesome things with them as well. Here and there I explained some advanced functionality, because I think you'll need it often, or because it helps understand some important concept of SQL. Nevertheless, I also created an <strong><em>Advanced SQL </em></strong>course to outline everything this course has ignored. It mainly provides lots of concepts that could dramatically improve your database system one day, but nothing a beginner would need.</p>

<p>I therefore recommend you first try a few projects of your own, before reading the advanced course. Once you have the basics down, the more complex parts start to make sense, and should be easy as pie.</p>

<p>Good luck with the rest of your database adventures!</p>
