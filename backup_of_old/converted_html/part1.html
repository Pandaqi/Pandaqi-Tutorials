  title: "[Phaser] A Beginners Guide"
  post: "<p>Phaser is a JavaScript library, developed by Photonstorm (check him out, he's done cool things). It's completely free, and will always be. It's particularly good for simplifying the basics of creating an HTML5 game for you, and then creating a simple 2D game with physics. And the whole library is just a small .js (JavaScript extension) file. Amazing for the starters!</p> 

<h2>Basic needs for every game</h2>

<p>A <strong>.html </strong>file---this is the game's page, this is where we bring together all the code in the end and the game is played.</p>

<p>The <strong>phaser.min.js</strong> file---included in the html file</p>

<p>A <strong>.js</strong> (javascript) file for every screen or scene in your game</p>

<p>Perhaps some folders for your media, graphics, scenes, etc., if you're keen on keeping stuff organized.</p>

<h2>The .html template</h2>

<pre data-lang="html"><!DOCTYPE> 
<html> 
    <head> 
        <meta charset="UTF-8" /> 
        <title>A title---displayed in the tab</title> 
        <!-- Include the Phaser library --> 
        <script src="phaser.min.js"></script> 
        <!-- Include all the different scenes/states of the game--> 
        <script src="Scenes/menuScreen.js"></script> 
        <script src="Scenes/mainGame.js"></script> 
        <script src="Scenes/gameOver.js"></script> 
    </head> 

     <body> 
    <script type="text/javascript"> 
    //When the page loads, do the following 
    window.onload = function() { 
        //Create a new Phaser game Object with properties: 
        //(width,height,displayMethod (WebGL or Canvas),appendToHTMLElement,setPreservedFunctions 
        var game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.AUTO, '', { preload: preload, create: create }); 

         //Add all the states to the game we just created 
        game.state.add('Menu', Scenes.MenuScreen) 
        game.state.add('Main', Scenes.MainGame) 
        game.state.add('GameOver', Scenes.GameOver); 

         //And start off with the first one 
        game.state.start('Menu'); 
    }; 
    </script> 
    </body> 
</html>

</pre>

<p>It's a very basic html page (comments with explanation in the code itself).</p>

<p>NOTE: In the 'appendToHTMLElement' property you can give the ID of an HTML element where you'd like the game to be created in. If you don't set anything, it's just created right after the <body> tag. The 'setPreservedFunctions' property allows you to set your own custom functions for the ones Phaser uses (preload, create and update are the only essentials to a Phaser game).</p>

<h2>A JavaScript file containing a scene (template):</h2>

<pre data-lang="javascript">
Scenes.MainGame = function(game) {
	//set all your variables for this scene here (LOCAL)
	this.time = 0;
	this.playerSize = 200;
};

Scenes.MainGame.prototype = {

preload: function() {
   //This function is called first, and must contain every image/spritesheet/etc. to be loaded for this scene
},

create: function() {
  //In this function then every object with its properties is created
},

update: function() {
  //Finally, this function runs at 60 FPS and is used to update everything and play the actual game.
},

};</pre>

<p>Above is the basic template for every scene. Remember when defining your variables, that you put <strong>this</strong>. before everything, to ensure the variable is part of the object and only available in this scene (and destroyed afterwards). However, you might have noticed we're putting objects into a certain 'master object' called 'Scenes'. You're right, we still need to define it! This is done at the top of the very<strong> first scene that is loaded</strong>, like this:</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">
var globalVar = 20;
var anotherGlobalOne = 30;

var Scenes = {};
</pre>

<p>Any <strong>global variables</strong>, to be used throughout the complete game (and not only this particular scene), can be set before defining this object that holds all the states (as you see). As you saw earlier, the <strong>local variables</strong> are created as part of the states' object. This means you need to put <strong>this.</strong> before a local variable when using it, and nothing in front of a global variable.</p>

<h2>Creating an actual game</h2>

<p>Due to the fact that everything in the game is inside an object which is linked to the Phaser Game Object (created in the html page), we need to put the magical words <strong>this.</strong> in front of nearly everything we type (without different states we would just use 'game' to refer to the game object).</p>

<h5>Loading the media</h5>

<p>First, you need to load all your media inside the preload function at the top. For example, loading images would be like this:</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">// Properties: ('name for reference', 'path to image to load')
this.load.image('star', 'star.jpg');</pre>

<p>Inside the create function we setup our scene to be used and manipulated in the update function later on. If we for example want to create a sprite from our image we just loaded (including physics):</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">//Initiate the physics system Arcade (There's also Ninja and p2 available)
this.physics.startSystem(Phaser.Physics.ARCADE);

//Make our player into a sprite (xPosition, yPosition, 'referenceName of image')
//Remember: 'player' must be loaded in the preload function
this.player = this.add.sprite(50,50,'player');

//Scale our player so he's 2 times as big
this.player.scale.setTo(2,2);

//Enable physics on our player (must be done after it has become a sprite)
this.physics.arcade.enable(this.player);

//Make the player collide with the edges of the game
this.player.body.collideWorldBounds = true;

//Make the player move 40px/s in the x-direction
this.player.body.velocity.x = 40;

//Give the guy a 20% bounce off of other objects
this.player.body.bounce.setTo(0.2,0.2);</pre>

<h5>Updating and playing</h5>

<p>The update function is run 60 times per second, and is used for animating/moving/interacting - the game itself. Before we move on, let's first set our variables in the top of the file before we forget</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">this.time = 0;
this.player = null;</pre>

<p>We're going to use the <strong>time</strong> variable to make our player move slower every 3 seconds. This is what we put into the update function:</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">//Make time increment equal to the actual time (1 extra per 1 second)
this.time += (1/60);

//If the value of time modula 3 equals zero, decrease player's velocity
if(this.time%3 === 0) {
   this.player.body.velocity.x -= 6;
}

//(modula = the remainder when x can't be divided by y anymore,
// e.g. 10%3 = 1, 12%3 = 0)</pre>

<p>Done! Now you have your first HTML5 scene moving. Now go create awesome games (but first, follow the advanced tutorial!).</p>"

  title: "[Phaser] An advanced guide"
  post: "<p>Assuming you've read the beginners tutorial and want to know more...you've come to the right place! In this post I'll cover the more advanced possibilities of Phaser (which are still pretty basic and fundamental really). Nevertheless, if you want to create a nice game, you better know these things.</p>

<h2>Grouping</h2>

<p>Phaser has created lots of support for <strong>grouping</strong> of objects, and for a good reason. Grouping objects (for example all the coins, platforms or enemies  in a level) makes it easy for you to go through all the objects of a group and check for something. It also makes it possible to move, rotate, scale, destroy, etc. the complete group all at once. And next to that, it makes your code simpler and easier to read for yourself!</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">//First define it
var platforms = null;

//Add this in the create function
platforms = game.add.group();

//Enable physics bodies for all members (current and to be added in the future)
platforms.enableBody = true;

//Create a sprite in it (or remove it);
platforms.create(xPos,yPos, someThing);
platforms.remove(someThing);</pre>

<p>NOTE: Groups don't have a physics body themselves. They're just an 'empty' container object, containing all it's children's bodies.</p>

<h2>Game vs World</h2>

<p>In Phaser, a distinction is made between game and world. <strong>Game</strong> is the size of the canvas, the size of that rectangle  you are viewing throughout the game. <strong>World</strong> is the size of the game world. This can be as big as you want, but you can give it a size with the <strong>width/height</strong> properties, and optionally boundaries by setting the <strong>bounds</strong> property (nothing can go beyond these boundaries). By default its starting point is at (0,0) and it's as wide as the game is. But, if you for example made a sidescroller game, you would make the world a lot wider than the game.</p>

<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>

<p>For Phaser-specific tips &amp; tricks to improve your workflow and make things just a bit easier go to this tutorial: <a href="http://thehtml5guide.net84.net/3-phaser-tips-tricks/" title="#3 Phaser – Tips &amp; Tricks"><strong>Phaser Tips &amp; Tricks</strong></a></p>

<h2>Physics all the way!</h2>

<p>For an explanation of all physics systems in Phaser and how they work, see this overview: <a href="http://thehtml5guide.net84.net/4-phaser-physics/" title="#4 Phaser – Physics!"><strong>Phaser Physics Systems</strong></a></p>

<h2>Nice Preloader</h2>

<p>Another useful thing to know when your game grows bigger, is how to add a nice preloader: <a href="http://thehtml5guide.net84.net/5-phaser-awesome-preloaders/" title="#5 Phaser – Awesome Preloaders"><strong>Phaser Preloaders</strong></a></p>

  title: "[Phaser] Tips & Tricks"
  post: "<p>When you've just started learning Phaser, there a few things you don't know. It's once you really start using it for creating something, that you run into problems and learn that most of the time Phaser has a cool, easy way to do it...or that there's a certain workaround or different approach that is favourable. Anyway, here's the sequel to the advanced guide, the professional tips &amp; tricks!</p><p>NOTE: For some parts I assume you use different states in your game. If you don't, that's fine, you'll just have to adapt the examples  a bit to your specific situation.</p> 

<h2>Common mistakes and debugging</h2>

<p>Here's a list of things that often go wrong with horrible results, without you realizing what the heck you did wrong this time. I'll also show you some ways to debug your code to find what causes the errors.</p>

<h5>Common Mistakes</h5>

<h6>Declaring and referencing functions</h6><p>If you're using states, often you'll get an error a certain function is undefined. This can have two reasons: the function is defined incorrectly, or it is called upon incorrectly. Let's say we call the function 'doStuff' in the standard 'update' function, it'd go like this:</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">update: function() {
	this.doStuff(aParameter);
},

doStuff: function(aParameter) {
	
},</pre>

<h6>Declaring and referencing variables </h6><p>In the same way, there can be some trouble with variables. If a variable isn't defined or of the correct type/value, it often throws vague errors or doesn't run your program at all. Remember this:</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">//GLOBAL VARIABLES
//Either in index.html
var globalThing = value;
var game = new Phaser.Game(blablabla);

//Or at the top of your first state, outside of the states object
var Scenes = {};
var globalTime = 0;

//They are used as you'd expect! For example:
globalTime = 2;


//LOCAL VARIABLES
//Set inside the object class of the state
Scenes.Main = function(game) {
   this.aVar = value;
   this.anotherOne = false;
}

//They are used with 'this.' in front. Always. Like this:
this.anotherOne = true;</pre>

<p>NOTE: If you somehow forget to put 'var' in front of your variables...It's actually no big deal, according to the JS compiler. What happens is: JS reads the variable, and thinks it has been declared earlier (because it has no var before it). However, it will not find this declaration, and will then continue to assign the variable to the highest level in the hierarchy of the game (which is the browser <em>window</em> in this case). So you've basically created a global variable, without it really being a global variable. It can even be useful, but I highly recommend you just don't use it, for it can cause weird errors that are very hard to debug (and you should learn proper programming, of course).</p><h5>Mixing up syntax</h5>
<p>Another error that can happen often, is that you're just in a flow, coding fast and happily, and without you realizing it you mix up different systems/syntaxes. You for example mix the syntax of a while-loop with the one of a for-loop, you mix the syntax for setting properties of an object with the one for setting variables, you call an object and use it's paramaters while you forget to pass any to it, etc. This kind of error is very hard to realize yourself, once you've made the mistake. So, now you know it, check it!</p>
<h5>Forgetting some words</h5><p>Especially when working with JS libraries, like Phaser, there's a very long line of code needed sometimes. You might forget to put a word in there, you might add one dot too much, you might forget that this one actually calls a function and does not return a boolean, etc. For example, a few of the mistakes I often made at the beginning:</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">//Adding a body to the player...WRONG
game.physics.enable(player);
//It's like this
game.physics.arcade.enable(player);

//Or forgetting the player already had a body...WRONG
player.velocity.x = 20;
//It's like this
player.body.velocity.x = 20;

//Or you might think you can quickly push a new object into an array...WRONG
var blockContainer = [];
var newBlock = this.add.sprite(50,50,'block');
blockContainer.push();
//You forgot to actually push something into it..
blockContainer.push(newBlock);</pre>

<h5>Resetting variables when switching states </h5>
<p>The Phaser's stateManager is quite powerful, and removes almost everything from a seen, but there might be some variables that are left over and remembered. If you need to come back to the same state within the same game (for example a Main Menu), you need to reset variables to the value they need to start with. For this, Phaser has a <strong>shutdown</strong> standard function (yes, next to preload, create and update). Within this function you can just set the variables you really need set to a certain value at the beginning of the scene.</p>

<h5>Debugging</h5>

<h6>Logging to the console</h6><p>If you're on chrome, hitting F12 will bring up the developer tools, and at the top you should see a few tabs, and the last of them is <strong>Console</strong>. This will display any errors it encounters loading your game, but it's also the place you can send information to test things. It's a simple as this:</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">console.log("I'm loggin' this!");
console.log("Player's x position: " + player.x);</pre>

<h6>Phaser's built in debugging system</h6><p>However, Phaser also has it's own built-in debugging system, to simplify matters a bit. It's basically the same as the console.log(), but it displays the result on the screen and updates in realtime. Just do:</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">
//Debug functions must be put inside a special render function that is called just before Phaser renders the game to the screen
render: function() {
	game.debug.text(xPosition, yPosition, "Our player's speed is " + player.velocity.x);
}
</pre>

<h5<Splitting up your code</h5><p>So, now you know how everything's running the show, but you still can't find where the error is in those 30 new lines of code you just wrote? Well, the simplest method to find the culprit, is to simply comment out parts of your code, until you don't have the error anymore. This approach works better if you divide the block of code in two halves every time, instead of taking for example 5 lines every time.</p>
<h5>Display your game's FPS</h5><p>One thing you might need to display, is the FPS (Frames per Second) of your game. This shows you when or whether the game is lagging a bit, which can help you in making your game faster and your code more efficient. It goes like this:</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">
//Set this flag to true in the create function
this.time.advancedTiming = true;

//Then read the FPS in the update function
this.time.fps

//For example: display it with Phaser's debugging system
game.debug.text(50,100,this.time.fps);</pre>

<h2>Phaser's useful properties/attributes and functions added to (almost) everything</h2>

<p>Everything in Phaser has a bunch of properties you can read and set, which are pretty mandatory for creating anything.</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">var player = this.add.sprite(100,100,'playerImage');

//The x and y position
player.x, player.y

//The rotation
player.rotation

//The anchor (center point), (0 -> 1) in percentages of complete sprite
player.anchor.x, player.anchor.y

//The scale
player.scale.x, player.scale.y

//The width and height
player.width, player.height

//The name 
player.name

//Check if it exists
//If false, it is invisible. If true, it is visible
player.exists

//Check if it's alive
//If false, the game pretends it's not there. If true, it does affect gameplay like usual
player.alive

//Fix it to the camera (boolean)
player.fixedToCamera

//Check if it's in the game camera or game world (boolean, readonly)
player.inCamera, player.inWorld

//Kill it when it's outside of the game world's bounds
player.checkWorldBounds = true;
player.outOfBoundsKill = true;

//For controlling something's health
player.health

//Set a lifespan (in ms) until something's killed
player.lifespan

//Check whether it is being destroyed (boolean, readonly)
player.destroyPhase</pre>

<p>NOTE: Because phaser sprites are objects, you can always attach your own custom properties to it. Like <strong>player.roleInTeam, </strong><strong>player.bulletsLeft</strong>, etc.</p>

<p>NOTE2: With any property that has an <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y </strong>value, you can also just use the following: <strong>.setTo(xVal, yVal);</strong> Next to this (yes, there is more, more awesomeness!) there are also some standard methods useful for a lot of things.</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">
//Crop the player's sprite into the rectangle specified
player.crop(rect);

//If the player's health property is set, the specified amount will be substracted from it
player.damage(amount);

//Destroy the sprite. This completely removes the sprite, never to be seen again.
// The destroyChildren boolean determines whether or not the sprite's children (if it were a group or container) should be destroyed too
player.destroy(destroyChildren);

//Kill the sprite. This simply makes the sprite invisible, frozen and indetectable, but it can be revived
player.kill();

//Check if this sprite overlaps with the 'someObject'
player.overlap(someObject);

//Completely reset something, giving it only a new x,y position and health value to start again with
player.reset(x,y,health);

//If a player was killed, you can revive it this way!
//(and setting an health along the way, but that's purely optional)
player.revive(health);
</pre>

<p>So, one important thing to remember is, that killing and destroying something is a different activity. Killing a sprite, will set '<strong>alive</strong>' to false and '<strong>exist</strong><strong>s</strong>' to false (and therefore '<strong>visible</strong>' to false). But, the sprite will live on, and can be revived at any time. However, destroying a sprite, will remove all of it, forever, never to be seen again.</p>

<h2>About efficiency and CPU-friendliness</h2>

<p>This brings us to our next topic: efficiency of resources. The fact is: HTML5 games are not as powerful as PC or console games. We have to be extra careful with how we use our resources. Therefore, it's a good idea to look at what you really need, and what not. If you need something the first time, you of course need to create it. But if you for example need lots and lots of instances of bullets, but the bullets often fly off screen, you can reuse the bullets flying off screen as new ones. This can be done by <strong>kill()</strong>ing it, and later <strong>revive()</strong>ing it. If you don't need something anymore, you're better off completely <strong>destroy()</strong>ing it so it doesn't take up any more CPU.</p>

<h2>Input: mouse, keyboard, touch, watever you like</h2>

  post: "<p>In the beginners tutorial, you've seen the Arcade physics system in action (only a tiny little bit, though). Phaser however takes physics to a whole new level, and brings 2 different systems with it: <em>Arcade, p2</em>.</p> 

<p><strong>Arcade:</strong> the arcade physics system is the easiest of them all (which also means the most limited), and as you might have guessed: best suitable for arcade games. It has simple collision and overlap checks for rectangle bodies (called AABB), and features like giving bodies velocity, gravity, friction, bounce, etc.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">Learn all about it in the <a href="http://thehtml5guide.net84.net/phaser-physics-arcade-system/"><strong>Arcade Physics Tutorial</strong></a> </p>

<p><strong>p2: </strong>the p2 physics system is the most advanced system. It does everything arcade does too, but can do a whole lot extra. It's very realistic yet easy to implement. The p2 system is well suited for the complex physics in a game (realistic falling/bouncing of objects, chains, thrusts, springs, constraints, etc.).</p>

  title: "[Phaser] Physics ARCADE System"
  post: "<p>The Arcade system was the first system implemented by Phaser, because it is the most basic and simple one, and will do perfectly for any 'arcade games'. This tutorial will teach you how to initiate the system and use it for some very useful tasks.</p> 
<h2>Starting the system</h2>
<p>Initiating the system is as simple as putting this at the top of the create function:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">game.physics.startSystem(Phaser.Physics.ARCADE);</pre>
<h2>Adding bodies to the system</h2>
<p>If you want something to be part of the system, and thus have a body and physics applied, you need to tell it to Arcade yourself.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//INDIVIDUAL SPRITES
game.physics.arcade.enable(sprite1);
game.physics.arcade.enable([sprite2,sprite3,sprite4]);

//FOR GROUPS
//For example, a group that holds all the platforms in a platformer
var platforms = game.add.group();
platforms.enableBody = true;</pre>
<p>Remember, only sprites can be made part of the physics system!</p>
<h2>Manipulating the bodies</h2>
<p>Now, you can do all sorts of things with the bodies. Below are the ones you'll use the most (but not all):</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//The player's velocity in either direction in px/s
//maxVelocity and minVelocity are also available, using the same syntax
player.body.velocity.setTo(x, y);

//The player's gravity (downwards on y, to the left on x) in px/s
player.body.gravity.setTo(x, y);

//The player's drag or friction in either direcion in px/s
player.body.drag.setTo(x, y);

//How much the body is bounced off of objects (0 -> 1, in percentages of collisionforce)
player.body.bounce.setTo(x, y);

//Whether or not the body moves when hit by something (boolean)
wall.body.immovable = true;

//Whether or not the body can move out of the world (otherwise it just stops at the edges)
player.body.collideWorldBounds = true;

//Acceleration of the object in either direction in px/s
player.body.acceleration.setTo(x, y);

//Setting an angularVelocity (again, px/s), with angular drag
player.body.allowRotation = true;
player.body.angularVelocity = someRadianValue;
player.body.angularDrag = someRadianValue;

//Some useful READONLY values
//For getting speed, position, previous position, where the body is facing
player.body.speed, player.body.position, player.body.prev, player.body.facing
</pre>
<h2>Checking for collisions!</h2>
<p>Now that everything has a body which behaves in its own way, we want to make sure the right things collide with each other, and we do actions based on that at the right time.</p>

<p>NOTE: For this, we move out of the create function, and into the update function!</p>

<p>First, although you've set the bodies up, nothing seems to hit anything. To make it do so, we need to tell objects to <strong>collide</strong> with each other.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Making stuff collide (2 sprites, sprite+group, 2 groups, whatever you like)
//collide(object1, object2, collideCallback, processCallback, callbackContext)
game.physics.arcade.collide(player, platforms, hitPlatform(), isPlatformSolid(), this);

/*collideCallback: the function you specify here is executed every moment the objects collide
processCallback: the function you specify here, must return true for the collision to work. 
		If the function returns false, the two objects will not collide
callbackContext: forget about this, either omit it or set it to 'this'

NOTE: Both the collideCallback and processCallback functions are passed two parameters, the first object and the second respectively.
*/
</pre>
<p>Simple enough. However, sometimes we want objects that don't collide, but still detect whether or not they overlap. For this we have <strong>overlap</strong>.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//overlap(object1, object2, collideCallback, processCallback, callbackContext)
game.physics.arcade.overlap(player, coins, collectCoin(), null);</pre>
<p>Now that we know that, we can get even more funky, and check what side of a certain object is hitting/<strong>touching</strong> something. This is for example useful if you want your player to jump only if it's touching something beneath it.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Is the player touching anything?
player.body.touching
//Was the player just touching anything?
player.body.wasTouching

//(this can be applied to both) Is it touching up/right/down/left?
player.body.touching.up, player.body.touching.right, player.body.touching.down, player.body.touching.left</pre>
<h2>Useful functions of the Arcade system</h2>
<p>Last, but not least, the arcade has some fancy built-in functions to simplify some tasks for you! Below are the ones I use most:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Accelerate object to certain x and y coordinates
game.physics.arcade.accelerateToXY(object, x, y, speed, maxSpeedX, maxSpeedY);

//Move the object to the x and y coordinates
//maxTime: the maximum amount of time it should take the object to reach the destination,
//the speed is adjusted by the system to achieve this!
game.physics.arcade.moveToXY(object, x, y, speed, maxTime);

//Get the angle between an object and x,y coordinates
game.physics.arcade.angleToXY(object, x, y);

//Get the distance between an object and x,y coordinates
game.physics.arcade.distanceToXY(object, x, y);

//Automatically set x and y velocity according to the angle you want to move in (velocityFromRotation also available)
game.physics.arcade.velocityFromAngle(angle, speed);

//A simple check for if two bodies intersect - it returns a boolean value (true/false)
game.physics.arcade.intersects(body1, body2)</pre>"

  title: "[Phaser] Physics P2 System"
  post: "<p>The p2 system implemented in Phaser, is the most powerful and broad one. It allows for very realistic collisions, has some useful extras (like chains, constraints, springs, thrust, etc.), and all of this without it being too hard to understand. However, due to the great size of this system, I will not cover all of it, just the fundamentals.</p>  
<h2>Initiating the P2 system</h2>
<p>This is the syntax for initiating the system, and below that the syntax for enabling physics to be used on a certain sprite.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">// adding P2 physics to the game
game.physics.startSystem(Phaser.Physics.P2JS);

// Enabling a body (=making physics available) on a certain sprite
game.physics.p2.enable(sprite1);</pre>
<h2>Creating different bodies</h2>
<p>Now that you know this, you want to create the bodies for your game. By default P2 will simply create a rectangle around your sprite, but that's not always what you want. You can tell P2 to draw a certain shape as a body for your sprite like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//All shapes are added to the anchor point of the body, which is automatically set to (0.5,0.5) = the exact center.

//Add a capsule shape (you know, a mix between an ellipse and a (rounded) rectangle)
someSprite.body.addCapsule(length, radius, offsetX, offsetY, rotation);

//Add a circle
someSprite.body.addCircle(radius, offsetX, offsetY, rotation);

//Add a line (running from [-length/2,0] to [length/2, 0])
someSprite.body.addLine(length, offSetX, offsetY, rotation);

//Add a rectangle
someSprite.body.addRectangle(width, height, offsetX, offsetY, rotation);

//Add a polygon
someSprite.body.addPolygon(options, points);

/*'options' is an object (optionally) asking for three things:
optimalDecomp (boolean): whether or not to optimally calculate physics (increases CPU load)
skipSimpleCheck (boolean): set to true if you want to skip checking if the polygon intersects itself
removeCollinearPoints (boolean): set to true if you want to remove them
		collinear points is the middle point when three points lie in a straight line, and is basically useless

*/

/*'points' is an array containing arrays with x,y values, like this:
[[0,2],[2,3],[4,1],[6,6]]

and it of course represents the points/vertices/corners of this polygon
*/

//The function for clearing all shapes from the body, use it when you want to add a single different body than the default rectangle that's added to it
//Because, you might have noticed, every method above 'adds' to the body.
someSprite.body.clearShapes();</pre>
<h2>Useful body attributes</h2>
<p>Now that you've initiated the system and enabled a body with the correct shape(s) on your sprite, you want to do stuff with them (I think, I can't read your mind).</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Set damping (friction), velocity and force
someSprite.body.damping, someSprite.body.force, someSprite.body.velocity
//This can also be applied to object's rotation, simply: 
angularDamping, angularVelocity, angularForce

//But, you can also tell it to just never rotate:
someSprite.body.fixedRotation = true;

//Set the gravity
someSprite.body.gravity = someValue;

//Make the body collide with the world bounds
someSprite.body.collideWorldBounds = true;

//Set the mass
someSprite.body.mass = someValue;

//set the angle (same as rotation, but set in radians, which is more efficient)
someSprite.body.angle = someValue;

//Allow sleep on a body
//Sleepingstate is turned on when a body is not/barely (see sleepSpeedLimit) doing anything. This helps save resources, because a lot of checks and functions don't need to be called by the system
someSprite.body.allowSleep();
someSprite.body.sleepSpeedLimit = someValue;

//Make a body kinematic or static (default is dynamic)
//Kinematic: general physics don't apply (e.g. gravity), but it still can collide
someSprite.body.kinematic = true;

//Static: the body just cannot move, but everything else can bump into it
someSprite.body.static = true;</pre>
<p>Knowing that, you can do pretty much everything. But, to simplify matters, there's a few standard functions:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Moving backward, forward, left, right, up, down
moveBackward(speed), moveForward(speed)
moveLeft(speed), moveRight(speed)
moveUp(speed), moveUp(down)

//Rotate left or right
rotateLeft(speed), rotateRight(speed)

//Thrust and reverse (move forward or backward in the direction you're looking at)
thrust(speed);
reverse(speed);</pre>
<h2>Mighty Methods and Easy Events</h2>
<p>In P2, there's a lot of events you can listen for. Most of them keep track of when things are added/removed or when something begins/ends. Therefore, unlike the other systems, there are no 'global' collide and overlap functions available where you give the function two objects and they collide. This time, this functionality exists on a body itself.

But, another thing p2 handles differently, is the fact that you can only collide objects with one or multiple <strong>collision groups</strong>. This means that everything you want the physics world to interact with, must be part of a certain collision group. This might seem unnecessary some times, but this helps speed up p2 and might even help you organize your game/code. So, basic collision detection goes like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//A script for colliding a ship (our player) with rocks
var ship;

function create() {
    //  Enable P2
    game.physics.startSystem(Phaser.Physics.P2JS);

    //  Turn on impact events for the world, without this we get no collision callbacks
    game.physics.p2.setImpactEvents(true);

    //  Create our collision groups. One for the player, one for the rocks
    var playerCollisionGroup = game.physics.p2.createCollisionGroup();
    var rockCollisionGroup = game.physics.p2.createCollisionGroup();

    //Create rocks at random positions
    var rocks = game.add.group();
    rocks.enableBody = true;
    rocks.physicsBodyType = Phaser.Physics.P2JS;

    for (var i = 0; i < 8; i++)
    {
        var rock = rocks.create(game.world.randomX, game.world.randomY, 'rock');
        //  Tell the rock to use the rockCollisionGroup 
        rock.body.setCollisionGroup(rockCollisionGroup);

        //  Make the rocks collide with other rocks, and the player
        rock.body.collides([rockCollisionGroup, playerCollisionGroup]);
    }

    //  Create our ship sprite (give it a circle as collision body, don't allow it to rotate
    ship = game.add.sprite(200, 200, 'ship');
    game.physics.p2.enable(ship, false);
    ship.body.setCircle(28);
    ship.body.fixedRotation = true;

    //  Set the ships collision group
    ship.body.setCollisionGroup(playerCollisionGroup);

    // When our player/ship hits one of the rocks, a function is fired (hitrock)
    // And if it happens, reduce the rock's alpha value
    ship.body.collides(rockCollisionGroup, hitrock, this);

}

function hitrock(body1, body2) {

    //  body1 is the body that owns the callback (the ship)
    //  body2 is the body it impacted with (our rock)
    //  As body2 is a Phaser.Physics.P2.Body object, you access its owner (the sprite) via the sprite property:
    body2.sprite.alpha *= 0.9;

}
</pre>
<p>You might think that's an awful lot of code for such a simple thing. But, I've included some extras here to give you a better idea of how this works, because it's very important to understand that.</p>

<p>Now that you know this, you might have noticed that the possibility to check if two things overlap (which is equally important as the collide() function) isn't discussed. Well, that's because that is hidden between the Phaser Signals /  Event Listeners you can call on the P2 system.</p>

<p>This is discussed more thoroughly in another post, but a short summary: Phaser has built in methods that create so called 'phaser signals' when a certain event happens. All you have to do then, is pick up these signals and hand them a function to execute.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Basic syntax for listening for events
//The context parameter is optional, and determines what defines the word 'this'
game.physics.p2.<someEvent>.add(functionToCall, context);

//These are all the possible events to listen for
onBeginContact, onEndContact
onBodyAdded, onBodyRemoved,
onContactMaterialAdded, onContactMaterialRemoved
onConstraintAdded, onConstraintRemoved,
onSpringAdded, onSpringRemoved</pre>
<p>However, although I said that those simple 'collide'/'overlap' functions don't exist here, there is an alternative that can be used sometimes, that checks if there's any body under a certain point in the world (most common use: checking all the bodies under your mouse pointer).</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">game.physics.p2.hitTest(worldPoint, bodies, precision, skipStatic);
//Worldpoint: the point (x,y) in this world we'll check against
//Bodies (optional, array): a list of bodies to check against, if not set, it checks for all the bodies in the world
//Precision (optional, number): for checking very small objects (like lines)
//skipStatic (optional,boolean): whether or not to include static bodies when hitTesting

//This function returns an array of bodies that hit that point in the world. To access the sprites attached to them, use .parent.sprite</pre>
 
<h2>Extra possibilities</h2>
<p>Next to almost pixel-perfect collision, p2 offers some extra features to help speed up your game making process.</p>
<h5>ContactMaterials</h5>
<p>ContactMaterials are what p2 uses for calculating what happens when two materials collide. With the system, you can create several materials, and assign them to objects. Then, you can say 'hey, if this material and that one collide, I want this to happen'. An implementation:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">function create() {

    //  Enable p2 physics
    game.physics.startSystem(Phaser.Physics.P2JS);

    //Set overall world gravity
    game.physics.p2.gravity.y = 300;

    //  Add a sprite
    var player = game.add.sprite(200, 200, 'dude');
    game.physics.p2.enable(player);
    player.body.fixedRotation = true;

    //Create a material for the player (second paramater tells the game to automatically assign this material to the player's body)
    var spriteMaterial = game.physics.p2.createMaterial('spriteMaterial', player.body);
    //Create another material
    var worldMaterial = game.physics.p2.createMaterial('worldMaterial');

    // And assign this one to the world (4 trues for left/right/top/bottom faces)
    game.physics.p2.setWorldMaterial(worldMaterial, true, true, true, true);

    //Create a contact material and set it to the two materials we created earlier
    // Whenever the player touches the world's edges, the following happens
    var contactMaterial = game.physics.p2.createContactMaterial(spriteMaterial, worldMaterial);

    contactMaterial.friction = 0.0;     // Friction to use in the contact of these two materials.
    contactMaterial.restitution = 0.0;  // Restitution (i.e. how bouncy it is!) to use in the contact of these two materials.
    contactMaterial.stiffness = 1e7;    // Stiffness of the resulting ContactEquation that this ContactMaterial generate.
    contactMaterial.relaxation = 0;     // Relaxation of the resulting ContactEquation that this ContactMaterial generate.
    contactMaterial.frictionStiffness = 1e7;    // Stiffness of the resulting FrictionEquation that this ContactMaterial generate.
    contactMaterial.frictionRelaxation = 3;     // Relaxation of the resulting FrictionEquation that this ContactMaterial generate.
    contactMaterial.surfaceVelocity = 0.0;        // Will add surface velocity to this material. If bodyA rests on top if bodyB, and the surface velocity is positive, bodyA will slide to the right.

}</pre>
<h5>Springs</h5>
<p>Adding a spring, is as easy as coding gets:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//  The parameters are: createSpring(sprite1, sprite2, restLength, stiffness, damping)
var spring = game.physics.p2.createSpring(sprite1, sprite2, 150, 5, 1);</pre>
<h5>Constraints</h5>
<p>A constraint basically defines a relation between two bodies: either a fixed distance, limits to their movement or rotation, fixing them to a certain point(/body) in space, reverse rotation between them (for gears for example), etc. This can't be done with one constraint function, therefore there are multiple ones covering all of the above: <strong>LockConstraint, </strong><strong>DistanceConstraint, GearConstraint, PrismaticConstraint, RevoluteConstraint.</strong></p>

<h6>LockConstraint</h6>

<p>This is the most simple one: simply puts a fixed x and y offset between two bodies. It's almost the same as adding a body as a child of another body, so it moves in the exact same way, but the advantage of the lockconstraint is that you can keep the seperate bodies and easily specify distance.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">game.physics.p2.createLockConstraint(bodyA, bodyB, offset, angle, maxForce);
//BodyA and BodyB = the two bodies being constraint
//offset: The offset between 'em
//angle: The angle between 'em
//maxForce (optional): the maximum force the physics system is allowed to use when pulling them together. Too low: constraining takes too long, too high: you get some supernatural speeds in your game</pre>
<h6>DistanceConstraint</h6>

<p>A distanceConstraint keeps two bodies at the same distance from each other, but allows all other types of movement. This means that for example one body can circle around the other, staying at the same distance the whole time.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">game.physics.p2.createDistanceConstraint(bodyA, bodyB, distance, maxForce);</pre>
<h6>GearConstraint</h6>

<p>A gear constraint doesn't constrain distance, but rotation/angle. This type sets the relative rotation between two bodies (so, if one body would rotate 180 degrees, and the relative rotation would be 0.5, the other one would rotate 90 degrees).</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">game.physics.p2.createGearConstraint(bodyA, bodyB, relativeAngle);</pre>

<h6>RevoluteConstraint</h6>

<p>A revolute constraint is a more difficult one to understand. It connects two bodies at given points, and let's them rotate relative to each other around this point. Sounds complicated, but you can better think of these as a hinge or pivot joint. One body is the hinge itself of which the center represents the pivot point of the second body. The second body then has all the physics applied, but can only rotate around this fixed point.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">game.physics.p2.createRevoluteConstraint(bodyA, pivotA, bodyB, pivotB, maxForce);
//bodyA &amp; bodyB = the two bodies being constrained
//pivotA, pivotB -> the point relative to the center of the body which it is constrained to
     //In case of a hinge, the first body could be a circle with it's pivot point at its center (so pivotA = (0,0))
     //The second one is the body (let's say rectangle) to rotate around that spot, which has it's pivotB set to the upper corner ( (-width/2, -height))</pre>
<h6>Prismatic Constraint</h6>

<p>This one's even harder to understand (well, at least I thought it was difficult). Basically, a prismatic constraint forbids bodies any movement along one axis, and makes it able to freely translate along the other.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">game.physics.p2.createPrismaticConstraint(bodyA, bodyB, lockRotation, anchorA, anchorB, axis, maxForce)
//bodyA, bodyB = the two bodies being constrained
//NOTE: the rest of the parameters is completely optional
//lockRotation (boolean) = whether or not the bodies are allowed to rotate
//anchorA, anchorB = the bodies' anchor point (set relative to its own local frame)</pre>

<h5>Limits to constraints</h5>
<p>If you've managed to figure out the type of constraint you want, and you applied it perfectly, you sometimes want to limit their behavior. This goes the same for all types, like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">someConstraint.upperLimit = someValue;
someConstraint.lowerLimit = someValue;

//You can add a motor to constraints:
//Set the speed
someConstraint.setMotorSpeed(12);

//Enable it: this makes the motor do its job
someConstraint.enableMotor() 

//Disable it: motor falls quiet, object follows gravity and all other basic physics rules again
someConstraint.disableMotor()</pre>

<h5>Chains</h5>
<p>P2 doesn't have an easy function for creating chains, but using some revoluteConstraints we can easily simulate them. And as seen that chains are something you often need in physics games, I'll elaborate a bit on it! (the code below is for a big part taken from Phaser's Examples page, and only a bit modified to make it easier to understand (I hope))</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">function preload() {
    //Load a spritesheet here
    //Two frames: first with one link of the chain from the front, second with one link of the chain from the side
    game.load.spritesheet('chain','./assets/sprites/chain.png',16,26);
}


function create() {
   //Start physics system, apply world gravity
    game.physics.startSystem(Phaser.Physics.P2JS);
    game.physics.p2.gravity.y = 1200;

    //Call the createRope function we're going to create below
    createRope(40,400,100);  // (length, xAnchor, yAnchor)
};



function createRope(length, xAnchor,yAnchor){
    //Variable containing the last link, so we can fix the new one to it
    var lastRect;
    //Width and height of the physics body (height is less than the actual image, to make it look better)
    var height = 20;
    var width = 16;
    //The force that holds this chain together
    var maxForce =20000;
    //Create as many links as the length variable demands
    for(var i=0; i<=length; i++){
        //Set x and y anchor: the rope is straight down, so x doesn't change, y does with 'height' amount
        var x = xAnchor;
        var y = yAnchor+(i*height);
        //Switch between frame 0 and 1 (and bring the last created piece on top, for prettier visuals)
        if (i%2==0) {
            newRect = game.add.sprite(x, y, 'chain',1)
        } else {
            newRect = game.add.sprite(x, y, 'chain',0); 
            lastRect.bringToTop();
        } 
        //Enable a body on the new rectangle
        game.physics.p2.enable(newRect,false);
        //Set a custom rectangle for the body (for same reason that height is less than the actual image)
        newRect.body.setRectangle(width,height);

        //If this piece is the first one, make it static => anchor it to the xAnchor and yAnchor provided.
        if (i==0) {
            newRect.body.static=true; 
        } else {  
            //If not, give the piece a push (just to show you the effect of the rope)
            newRect.body.velocity.x = 100;
            //Reduce mass for every element (why? because the lower you get, the less gravitational energy is applied)
            newRect.body.mass =  length/i;
        }
        //From our second element on, we want to create a constraint between this one and the last one
        if(lastRect) {
            //Top of the new rectangle (0,-10), locks in with the bottom of the last rectangle (0,10)
            game.physics.p2.createRevoluteConstraint(newRect, [0,-10], lastRect, [0,10], maxForce);
        }
        //Update the last rectangle created!
        lastRect = newRect;
    }; 
}</pre>

  title: "[Phaser] Awesome Preloaders"
  post: "<p>As your game reaches larger and larger sizes (due to more media and lots of code added), it's going to take a while to load. However, you don't want to wait 10 seconds, watching a black screen doing nothing, before a new screen loads. Therefore, implementing a preloader can be nice!</p>

<p>When implementing this preloader, you actually want 2 states before the main menu: <strong>Boot </strong>and <strong>Preloader</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Boot.js</strong>: this state loads the images needed for the preloader (the loadingBar, shouldn't take more than a second).</p>

<p><strong>Preloader.js:</strong> this state displays the loadingBar, while loading the media for the game.</p> 

<h2>Boot.js</h2>
<p>In Boot.js, you can do the following:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var Scenes = {};

//Receiving the game variable
//Another option: set the game variable as a global variable in the main html file
Scenes.Boot = function (game) {
	this.game = game;
};

Scenes.Boot.prototype = {

	preload: function () {
		//Load images for a full loader and the empty one
		this.load.image('loaderFull', 'assets/UI/loaderFull.png');
		this.load.image('loaderEmpty', 'assets/UI/loaderEmpty.png');
	},

	create: function () {
		//Start the preloader-state
		this.game.state.start('preloader',Scenes.Preloader);
	},
	
}</pre>
<p>NOTE: This would also be the place to adapt (scale) your game to which device is using it. Learn about that in the <a title="#7 Phaser – Multiple Devices" href="http://thehtml5guide.net84.net/7-phaser-multiple-devices/"><strong>Phaser Multiple Devices Tutorial</strong></a></p>

<p>NOTE2: Learn about all the media (image, spritesheet, audio, etc.) you can load in the <a title="#6 Phaser – Graphics and Design" href="http://thehtml5guide.net84.net/6-phaser-graphics-and-design/"><strong>Phaser Graphics/Design Tutorial</strong> </a></p>

<h2>Preloader.js</h2>
<p>Then, in Preloader.js:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">Scenes.Preloader = function (game) {
    this.game = game;
};

Scenes.Preloader.prototype = {
    preloadBar: Phaser.Sprite,
    loaderEmpty: Phaser.Sprite,

    preload: function () {
    	//Display an empty loader
        this.loaderEmpty = this.add.sprite(300, 300, 'loaderEmpty');

        //Create the full loader
        this.preloadBar = this.add.sprite(300, 300, 'loaderFull');
        //And let Phaser adjust it's size according to the loading progress
		this.load.setPreloadSprite(this.preloadBar);
    },
    
    create: function () {
    	//Start the main menu once done loading        
        this.game.state.start('mainMenu', Main.MainMenu);
    },

}</pre>
<p>And now you should have a well working preload-system. The user knows it's loading, how much is already loaded, and it looks great. Well, assuming you use great-looking art work, obviously</p>"

  title: "[Phaser] Graphics and Design"
  post: "<p>There are multiple ways to load or display something, each with their own advantages and disadvantages</p>
<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p>With Phaser, you can (dynamically) create simple shapes/drawings (like rectangles, lines, points, circles, arcs, etc.). These shapes can't be made into a sprite or given physics, so all you they do is just stand tall and proud in your game.</p> 

<p>However, these graphics can be dynamically created, destroyed and in a few clever ways altered. This makes them the ideal candidate for some game design that doesn't have much interactivity, for they are faster to create, more dynamic and more efficient than creating images and putting them into sprites for every piece of your design.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">function create() {

    var graphics = game.add.graphics(0, 0);

    // set a fill (color,alpha)
    graphics.beginFill(0xFF3300,1);
    // and a line style (width, color,alpha)
    graphics.lineStyle(10, 0xffd900, 1);
    
    // draw any shape
    //moveTo: defines first/starting point of the shape
    graphics.moveTo(0,50);

    //every lineTo: defines the next point
    graphics.lineTo(250, 50);
    graphics.lineTo(100, 100);
    graphics.lineTo(0, 50);

    //end this fill = end the shape
    graphics.endFill();
    
    // draw a rectangle
    graphics.lineStyle(2, 0x0000FF, 1);
    graphics.drawRect(50, 250, 100, 100);
    
    // draw a circle
    graphics.lineStyle(0);
    graphics.beginFill(0xFFFF0B, 0.5);
    graphics.drawCircle(470, 200,100);
    
    //draw a line
    graphics.lineStyle(20, 0x33FF00);
    graphics.moveTo(30,30);
    graphics.lineTo(600, 300);

}</pre>
<h2>BitmapData</h2>

<p>When something is of the type bitmapData, it basically means "we have this rectangle, and you can have control over every pixel inside of it, and you can either paint 'em or leave 'em alone".</p>

<p>So, it's basically the same as the graphics discussed before, but we now only have a certain field to work in, and we have limited options. So what's the upside of this? We can make them into a sprite!</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//A Square
//Create a piece of bitmapData of 20x20
var aSquare = game.add.bitmapData(20,20);
//Create a rectangle in there, from (0,0) to (20,20)   (relative to the (0,0) of the bitmapData piece, not those of the game world)
aSquare.rect(0,0,20,20,'rgba(100, 255, 100,0.6)');

//A Circle
var aStar = game.add.bitmapData(20,20);
//Create a circle with center (10,10)
aStar.circle(10,10,10,'rgba(255, 255, 100,0.6)');

//Create a sprite from the square
var ourPlayer = game.add.sprite(50,50,aSquare);</pre>
<p>This is great and all, but there's also an alternative method of drawing in a bitmapData, and this requires knowledge of traditional JavaScript canvas-drawing methods. Here's a square with a stroke, created by using the bitmapData's context:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var smth = this.add.bitmapData(100,100);
smth.context.fillStyle = 'blue';
smth.context.strokeStyle = 'green';
smth.context.rect(0,0,100,100);
smth.context.fill();
smth.context.stroke();
game.add.sprite(50,50,smth);</pre>
<h2>Different Media Types</h2>
<p>But, next to that, there are also a few types of media you can load in the preloader function:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Images
game.load.image('name (for reference)','path (to file)');

//Audio
//Note: you can set an array of paths to the same audio file with different extensions, for not every browser supports the same type of file
game.load.audio('name','path');

//BitmapFont
//The two parameters set to null are not very useful (they're for loading XML for your font
game.load.bitmapFont('name','path',null,null, xSpacing, ySpacing);

//Spritesheets
game.load.spritesheet('name','path','width of one frame','height of one frame','amount of frames','margin between frames','spacing between frames');

//atlas, JSON and tilemaps are also supported, but not important enough right now to talk about here.</pre>
<h2>Spritesheets</h2>
<p>Spritesheets are an incredibly useful way to animate characters/objects in your game.</p>

<p>A spritesheet is basically a long image (horizontally), with all the different frames or states of the character pasted next to each other. Every frame is of the same width and height and represents the character as idle, walking, jumping, crawling, exploding, watever.</p>

<p>Once you've loaded your spritesheet, you have to create animations out of it. Then you assign those to the player, and then (at the appropriate moment) you play them...like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">player = game.add.spritesheet(x, y, 'reference to loaded spritesheet');

//Add animations to player for walking left and right
//add("name", [frames to display after each other], how many frames to play per second, whether to loop the animation or not)
player.animations.add('left', [0, 1, 2, 3], 10, true);
player.animations.add('right', [5, 6, 7, 8], 10, true);

//Then, at any time, you can start and stop them.
player.animations.play('left');
player.animations.stop();

//Or pick one frame for the moment
player.frame = 4;</pre>
<h2>Fonts and Text!</h2>
<p>Having text in your game is of course very important for the menus, buttons, score and health displayer, game over screen, and what not.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Add text to the screen - (xPosition, yPosition, textToDisplay, fontToUse);
//A bitmapFont you loaded earlier
game.add.text(50,50,"GAME OVER",'namehere');

//A font you specified in your CSS
game.add.text(50,50,"Game Over",{ font: '30px GaramondPro'});

//The same font, with more properties:
game.add.text(50,50,"GameOver", {
                font: "128px GaramondPro",
                fill: "#ff0044",
                align: "center"
            });
//Other properties include:
//fontWeight, lineSpacing, shadowBlur, shadowColor, shadowOffsetX, shadowOffsetY, stroke, strokeThickness

</pre>
<p>What's a bitmap font, you say? A bitmap font, is just an image of letters. The font can 't be scaled (which is why it doesn't require a size when initializing it), but has the advantage that it loads much much faster.</p>"

  title: "[Phaser] Multiple Devices"
  post: "<p>The big advantage of HTML5 games is that they can be played on any device. But, to really make the most of it, we also want it to display perfectly on every screen, with every size. Now you could of course go on and create a few different versions of every variable and code snippet for different screen sizes, but that's not really the easiest way to go. No, we're going to use Phaser's Scale Manager!</p> 
<h2>Deciding how you want it scaled</h2>
<p>So, you've created a game in your own browser, the dimensions were always 1200x900, and every number is adjusted to that. Then it would be a real pain in the ass to make every number dependent of width/height. So, we better use the scale manager to scale the size of the game, while at the same time scaling the game itself, making it work exactly the same everywhere. However, there are different ways you may want to have your game scaled, and there are different methods to achieve that - sadly enough, there's not one best and proven method provided at the moment.</p>

<p>What you probably want though is that your game is resized to fill as much of the screen as possible, but still maintains its own proportions (so it isn't stretched or distorted). We'll focus on that here.</p>
<h2>Setting your basic requirements</h2>
<p>So, the first thing you want to do is add a piece of code in the <head> of your game's html page. This is the meta viewport tag, which was originally invented for better rendering of websites on mobile screens.</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, width=device-width, height=device-height, target-densitydpi=device-dpi" /></pre>
<p>This makes it impossible for the user to scale the game, sets the game's width and height properly, and adjusts it's pixel representation according to the dpi of the device.</p>

<p>Also in the game's html page, you need to set the width and height that are perfect for your game:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var WIDTH = 1200;
var HEIGHT = 900;
var game = new Phaser.Game(WIDTH, HEIGHT, Phaser.AUTO, '');</pre>

<h2>Scaling</h2>
<p>Now we can start scaling the game. I'm assuming you're using different states for your game, and you should put this code in the first one (in the create function). If you're not using states, replace 'this' with 'game', and put the code at the top of your code.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Set the scale mode to SHOW_ALL (explained in a second)
this.scaleMode = Phaser.ScaleManager.SHOW_ALL;

//Align the center of the game with the center of the screen
this.scale.pageAlignHorizontally = true;
this.scale.pageAlignVertically = true;

//Force landscape (optional of course)
this.scale.forceLandscape = true;

//Make the game scale!
this.scale.setShowAll();
this.scale.refresh();

//In case you want limitations to your scaling!
this.scale.minWidth = someValue;
this.scale.minHeight = someValue;
this.scale.maxWidth = someBiggerValue;
this.scale.maxHeight = someBiggerValue;</pre>
<h2>This should do the trick!</h2>
<p>But, you might be wondering: why? what the hell? what are we doing here?! Calm down, answers are coming your way.</p>

<p>First, we set the scaleMode. There are 3 different scale modes:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>NO_SCALE:</strong> Don't scale. Ever.</li>
	<li><strong>SHOW_ALL:</strong> Show the complete game, but don't stretch it (so, some borders/margins might appear on screens with weird proportions)</li>
	<li><strong>EXACT_FIT:</strong> No matter what happens, glue the game exactly to the screen</li>
</ul>

<p>We then set some optional properties, and finally tell the game to actually scale itself! We tell it to do a SHOW_ALL with the properties we assigned to it, and refresh it just in case something has gone wrong or has resized, and then we're done.</p>
<h2>But, what if the user resizes the screen?</h2>
<p>We got you covered! Add this somewhere in that window.onLoad function in your game's html page:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//This function is called when the browser resizes
var resizeGame = function () {
     //Refresh the scaling of the game!
     game.scale.setShowAll();
     game.scale.refresh();
}

//Add an event lister to the browser window - if it resizes, call the resizeGame() function
window.addEventListener('resize', function(event){
     resizeGame();
});</pre>
<h2>But, what if I want different scale modes for different devices?</h2>
<p>Phaser checks that too. Like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Check with if statements, what device the user's on
//Desktop
game.device.desktop
//Android
game.device.android
//Apple devies
game.device.iOS
game.device.iPad
game.device.iPhone

//Check browsers
game.device.chrome
game.device.firefox
game.device.ie
game.device.safari

//Check OS
game.device.macOS
game.device.windows</pre>
<p>And there's even more, but I think this is already more than you need.</p>"

  title: "[Phaser] Input"
  post: "<p>In Phaser, there is of course a built-in support for all different input systems. There are basically three groups: <strong>mouse, keyboard  </strong>(only computers) <strong>and touchscreen</strong> (mobile, iPad, etc.).</p>
<h2>Methods available in all groups</h2>
<p>Every input object has the following events you can listen for, or properties you can access:</p>  
<pre data-lang="javascript">//If either just pushed down, let go (pushed up), tapped or being held: call the doSomething function
game.input.onDown.add(doSomething,this);
game.input.onUp.add(doSomething,this);
game.input.onTap.add(doSomething,this);
game.input.onHold.add(doSomething,this);

//These things can also be done without event listeners: just an if-statement checking if true or false
//But, the difference here is, that it doesn't check an activity (like letting go), but just a state (being up)
game.input.isDown
game.input.isUp

//Last but not least, this points to the most recently active pointer (mouse or touch event)
game.input.activePointer
//And this points to that pointer's x and y coordinates
game.input.x, game.input.y</pre>
<h2>Mouse only</h2>

<p>There's really only one thing specific to the mouse, and that is:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Get the mousePointer (you can apply the methods described above afer it, of course)
game.input.mousePointer

//Get its x and y
game.input.mousePointer.x
game.input.mousePoiner.y</pre>
<h2>Touch only</h2>
<p>We have 10 fingers. And what's so useful about that information, you say? Phaser also has 10 pointers, reserved for touchevents.</p>

<p>We have <strong>game.input.pointer1</strong> all the way to <strong>game.input.pointer10 </strong>objects. Phaser will start 2 of them (pointer1, pointer2) by default, but if you want to make the user able to use more than 2 fingers, you can start more of them.</p>

<p>Pointers are always trying to fill in the pointer object with the smallest number, which means that when you for example have two fingers placed on the screen(pointer1+pointer2), and you place a third one, it gets the pointer3 object.</p>

<p>However, if you then remove the second finger, pointer2 will be left empty and any finger you'll put on after that will first use the pointer2 object.</p>

<p>NOTE: To add more than those standard two pointers (the mousePointer excluded), you simply do <strong>game.input.addPointer(); </strong>as many times as you want (well, with a maximum of 10).</p>
<h2>Keyboard only</h2>
<p>The keyboard of course offers the largest array of possible inputs, but most of the times all you really need are the arrow keys. Phaser has a fast way to get them working quickly:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//In the create function
var cursors = game.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys();

//In the update function
if (cursors.left.isDown) {
    //move player left
} else if (cursors.right.isDown) {
    //move player right
}
if(cursors.up.isDown) {
	//make the player jump
} else if (cursors.down.isDown) {
	//make the player crouch
}</pre>
<p>However, if you want more, this is the way to do it:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//The keyboard can be accessed through
game.input.keyboard

//Then, any method you call on it, needs to be passed which key we're listening for
//Pause the game when P is pressed
if(game.input.keyboard.isDown(Phaser.Keyboard.P)) {
	//pause game
}

//Start new level when SPACE is pressed
if(game.input.keyboard.isDOwn(Phaser.Keyboard.SPACE)) {
	//start new level
}</pre>

  title: "[Phaser] Extraordinary Events"
  post: "<p>Phaser also has a few built-in events ready for anything, think of them as the Event Listeners you find in many languages.</p> 

<p>First, to save CPU, every event is set to false and is not checked. The event sends of 'Phaser signals' and waits for them to be picked up by something. If we want our game to recognize them, we simply add a listener with our function it should call to it. Like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Here's how you attach an event to any object (let's take our player sprite)
player.events.<THE EVENT HERE>.add(yourFunctionToCall(), this);

//And these are all the events that are possible, which I thought were quite self-explanatory 
//(so, substitute any of them with '<THE EVENT HERE>', and you're good to go)

onAddedToGroup
onRemovedFromGroup
onKilled
onRevived
onOutOfBounds
onEnterBounds

onInputOver
onInputOut
onInputDown
onInputUp
onDragStart
onDragStop

onAnimationStart
onAnimationComplete
onAnimationLoop</pre>
<h2> So Easy?!</h2>
<p>Yes. Well, the input events require some extra work, for input detection is turned off by default. To make them work, you have to:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Make it detect any input on the object
sprite.inputEnabled = true;

//Make dragging available for the object
sprite.enableDrag();</pre>

  title: "[Phaser] Tweens"
  post: "<p>Tweens are used for smoothly transitioning between certain values for an object, basically a dynamic animation. You simply create a new tween by doing the following:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Create tween someTween, to control the object someObject
var someTween = game.add.tween(someObject);</pre>
<p>Then, to create a basic tween, you want to set a start and end point, which values to influence, and then start it.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Properties: a JS object containing the the things to be tweened, like Sprite.x, Sound.Volume
//Duration and delay before it starts in milliseconds
//Ease parameter requires a function that eases the tween
//autoStart is a boolean that's automatically set to false
//Repeat determines the number of repeats
//Setting the yoyo boolean to true gives the tween a yoyo effect
someTween.from(properties, duration, ease, autoStart, delay, repeat, yoyo);
someTween.to(properties, duration, ease, autoStart, delay, repeat, yoyo);

//All these things can also be set seperately, like this (without < > of course):
someTween.<theParameter>(<theValue>)

//start, stop, pause and resume
someTween.start(); someTween.stop(); someTween.pause(); someTween.resume();</pre>
<p>As simple as that! However, if you want even more functionality out of it, there's also these methods you can use:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//A boolean that returns true if the tween is running
someTween.isRunning;

//Set the tween to loop
someTween.loop();

//These are all simple Phaser Signals!
//For non-looping tweens (when done/completed)
someTween.onComplete
//For looping tweens (is called every time a new iteration starts)
someTween.onLoop
//When the tween starts

  title: "[Three.js] A Beginners Guide"
  post: "<p>Three.js is an amazing javascript library that makes creating WebGL (= 3D in the browser) games much, much easier. It's available as a single, minified javascript file to include in your html page. From there on, you can use all of its useful features to create your 3D game (or application). However, you obviously can't just include the file and expect magic things to happen, you have to learn how to use and work with the engine! Well, you've come to the right place, as this is the tutorial that will get you up and running.</p> 

<p>- Get the Three.js library <a href="http://threejs.org/build/three.min.js" target="_blank">here</a> (click it, save the page as 'three.min.js', and you're good to go!)</p>
<h2>3D? That sounds amazing...but difficult</h2>
<p>Well yes, and no. The world of 3D is one dimension larger than the 2D one, and that requires quite a bit of extra stuff to take care of and keep in mind when creating your game (cameras, lightning, materials, etc.). Creating something in 3D, especially if you're completely new to games, requires from you to acquire the proper mindset: you can't just drop a square into the world, and all will be alright. The square needs (x,y,z) positions, dimensions, material, shaders, shadows, a camera pointed at it, lightning to actually show it, etc.</p>
<p>But, if you want to achieve any type of realistic or POV look, trying to fake it using 2D methods is much harder than just taking the extra time and using native 3D</p>
<h2>Creating a basic 3D scene</h2>
<p>This might all sound scary, but luckily, setting up a basic scene with Three.js is actually very, very easy. To display any 3D-program on a computer, you need a few things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A renderer: something that renders the complete 3D scene</li>
	<li>A scene: a space where everything is created and takes place</li>
	<li>A camera: a camera through which we view the world</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating the .html file</h2>
<p>Any HTML5 game can be accessed by simply going to its website/page. Therefore, the first thing you do with any browser game, is create its HTML webpage.</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Some Cool 3D Game</title>
		<style>canvas { width: 100%; height: 100% }</style>
	</head>
	<body>
        <!-- Include the javascript library -->
		<script src="js/three.min.js"></script>
        <!-- Here goes all our game's code -->
		<script>
			
		</script>
	</body>
</html></pre>
<h2>Creating the basics for any HTML5 game</h2>
<p>Any HTML5 game has a loop at its core, its heart that keeps beating, that works like this: we tell JavaScript to call a certain function about 60 times per second (depends on the framerate you choose or what your system can handle). Every time the function is called, the complete screen is cleared of all objects, and then the whole game is drawn again with the updated positions/rotations/objects/etc. Luckily, the good people creating JavaScript, have created a function for just that.</p>
<pre >function render()
{  
	//Loop this render function we're in at 60 frames/second
	//Also, when we're not focussed on this webpage, this pauses our game (useful!)
    requestAnimationFrame(render);

	//All the logic for your game comes here, this is where all the magic happens
    ...

    //And once the magic has happened, we tell THREE.JS to update the scene according to the new standards
    //'renderer' is a variable we'll define in the next part
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

//And last but not least, don't forget to call the function ONCE
render();</pre>
<h2>Creating the basics of a Three.js 3D scene</h2>
<p>Now that the game's webpage is created, and we're sure we're looping our game at a comfortable framerate, we need to initiate Three.js and create a basic scene we can do stuff with later on. As stated earlier, we're going to need a few different things for it to work. Put this just after the <script> tag, before your render() function:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Set the size of the game
//If you want it fullscreen, use window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight
var WIDTH = 400,
  HEIGHT = 300;

//Set the attributes for our camera (field of view, aspect ratio, near point, far point)
//Near and far point specify in which area things will be rendered in front of the camera
//Set them to values closer to each other if you want a more efficient game, otherwise just leave it this way
var VIEW_ANGLE = 45,
  ASPECT = WIDTH / HEIGHT,
  NEAR = 0.1,
  FAR = 10000;

//Create the renderer (WebGLRenderer is standard, there are others, but those are just automatic fallbacks for older browsers)
var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

//Create the camera using our predefined variables
var camera =
  new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
    VIEW_ANGLE,
    ASPECT,
    NEAR,
    FAR);

//Create the scene
var scene = new THREE.Scene();

//Add the camera to it, and pull it back a bit, because it starts at (0,0,0)
scene.add(camera);
camera.position.z = 20;

//Set the size of the renderer
renderer.setSize(WIDTH, HEIGHT);

//Assuming you've created an element with id 'gameCanvas' you want to put your game in..
//Get this element, and append the renderer to it, to start things off
var c = document.getElementById("gameCanvas");
c.appendChild(renderer.domElement);</pre>
<h2>Okay...nice I guess?</h2>
<p>Now you should see no errors, and there should be a 3D scene loaded into your canvas. However, nothing is actually in the scene, so there's really nothing to see. Now would be the time to start putting objects or so-called <em>geometries</em> into the scene. I'll demonstrate the regular simple box/cube.</p>
<h2>It's a cube!</h2>
<p>The code explains itself (this still needs to be put before the render() function, because we're simply creating something, and not updating anything).</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Create geometry for the object (a cube with dimensions (1,1,1))
var geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1,1,1);
//Create a material for it
//The MeshBasicMaterial is one of the materials included, and is a material that doesn't care about lightning or anything,
//but is useful for testing out things
var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0x00ff00 } );

//Create the cube, by telling Three.js to create a new mesh, providing it with our cube's geometry and material
//NOTE: This means, that you can create a more complex geometry, and then only call THREE.Mesh once to draw 'em all, which reduces CPU load!
var cube = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );

//Finally add the cube to the scene
scene.add(cube);
</pre>
<p>The reader who's been paying attention might now ask the question 'but, there's no light, why do we see the cube?'. When we don't give THREE.js a light, it just lights the whole scene with an universal, global light. This might be useful in some cases, but looks horrific in most cases.</p>
<h2>I like to move it move it</h2>
<p>The last piece of this beginners tutorial will be showing you how to make the cube actually do something. Put this in the render() function, right between the requestAnimationFrame, and the renderer call:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">cube.rotation.x += 0.1;
cube.rotation.y += 0.1;</pre>
<h2>What now?</h2>
<p>It would be wise, to continue with our advanced tutorial. This covers the extra basic possibilities of Three.js, some extra features you will find useful, and links to more specific tutorials on Three.js subjects.</p>"

  title: "[Three.js] An Advanced Guide"
  post: "<p>Now that you've read the beginners guide, you want more! And you get more. Learning how to create the very basics of a 3D scene is exciting, but not even close to enough to be able to create your game. In this advanced guide I'll walk you through everything you'll need to create an actual game. I will not cover everything that is possible, only the 'advanced basics' so to speak - how to create any object, how to make the whole set of objects in the scene look good, and how to make these extras work and do their tasks properly.</p> 
<h2>Purposeful Properties!</h2>
<p>Every object in a Three.js world inherits from a certain master object called 'Object3D'. This object contains some very useful properties you'll have to use for pretty much everything. Specific objects add their own extra properties, but these are the ones you can use on anything:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Updating or Reading the position, rotation and scale
someObject.position
someObject.rotation
someObject.scale

//Everything has the properties x,y,z to set them individually, like this:
someObject.position.x = 20;

//To set them all at once, use..
someObject.position.set(20,60,10);
</pre>
<p>And if you've created a mesh (like the cube from the previous tutorial), there are also these extra properties you might find useful:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Get geometry of a mesh
someMesh.geometry

//This contains the vertices and faces
//Which are all stored in an array you can loop through
someMesh.geometry.vertices
someMesh.geometry.faces</pre>
<h2>Please Note</h2>

<p>To save lots of resources, Three.js by default turns off any changes on anything. If you've changed the geometry of an object, you need to tell the system that you did so:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Make the geometry dynamic, so it allows updates
someMesh.geometry.dynamic = true;

//You get the idea..
someMesh.geometry.verticesNeedUpdate = true;
someMesh.geometry.facesNeedUpdate = true;
someMesh.geometry.normalsNeedUpdate = true;

//As an alternative, you can set these flags on the object once at the beginning, to notify the system this will need constant updating..
someMesh.__dirtyVertices = true;
someMesh.__dirtyEdges = true;
someMesh.__dirtyFaces = true;</pre>
<p>What I've just told you, isn't everything there is: there are more common properties, methods, etc.  - but these ones are the most common and useful.</p>"

  title: "[Three.js] Lighting"
  post: "<p>Just like in the real world, there are multiple types of lighting in Three.js. If you don't create one, everything in the scene renders 'flat/unlit' (that's Three.js's standard lightning). If you create one or more, those lights take over everything. The following are available: <strong>PointLight, SpotLight, DirectionalLight, HemisphereLight, AmbientLight</strong>. I've ordered these types in terms of how much of an impact they have. I'll also explain each of them with a bit of code.</p>

<h2>PointLight</h2>

<p>A light source that emits light in all directions, like a light bulb.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//PointLight(color of the light, intensity, max distance)
var light = new THREE.PointLight( 0xff0000, 1, 100 );

//Give it a better x,y,z position
light.position.set( 50, 50, 50 );

//Add it to the scene
scene.add( light );</pre>
<h2>SpotLight</h2>

<p>A SpotLight makes its light originate from a certain specified point, and move outward in a coned direction (using the angle you specified). It is almost identical to a spotlight you see in the real world.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//SpotLight(color, intensity, distance, angle (radians), rapidity of falloff of light)
var light = new THREE.SpotLight( 0xff0000, 1, 100,Math.PI/5,10);
</pre>
<h2>Directional Light</h2>

<p>A directional light is the opposite of a spotlight: it's a light which produces parallel rays (as if the light is infinitely far away, like the sun) that shine in a certain, single direction.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//DirectionalLight(color, intensity);
var light = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xff0000, 1);

</pre>
<p>'We don't need to set a direction?' you might wonder. No, the light always points towards the absolute center (origin) of the scene, so setting it to for example x = -100 makes it shine towards the right, and setting y = 100 makes it shine from the top to the bottom.</p>

<h2>HemisphereLight</h2>

<p>This light is positioned directly above the screen, and behaves like a sun at noon. Its shape is that of sphere, which means that this light emits downwards from every possible direction.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//HemisphereLight(skyColor, groundColor, intensity);
var light = new THREE.HemisphereLight(0x0000ff, 0x00ff00, 1);</pre>
<h2>AmbientLight</h2>

<p>And last, but not least, the ambient light, which of course creates some ambience! It doesn't originate from a certain position, or move in a certain direction: it just lights the complete scene with the specified color - like a subtle color overlay for the scene.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var light = new THREE.AmbientLight( 0x404040 ); // soft white light</pre>
<h2>Keep in mind the Shadows!</h2>
<p>If you now were to create a nice light, and a cube, you would be surprised to see that no shadows appear! That's normal. Again, to save resources, we need to enable a few things that are turned off by default by Three.js. First of all, every light doesn't cast shadows automatically, we need to set that boolean to true:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">someLight.castShadow = true;
//NOTE: Ambience lights can't cast shadows</pre>
<p>Second of all, for every object, you can set whether it <em>casts</em> shadows or not, and also if it <em>receives</em> shadows from other objects or not.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Casting and receiving
someObject.castShadow = true;
someObject.receiveShadow = false;

//Optionally, you can set the darkness of an objects' shadows
someObject.shadowDarkness = 0.5;</pre>
<p>And last of all, the renderer needs to know if we're using shadows <em>at all</em> in our game:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">renderer.shadowMapEnabled = true;
//If you want soft shadow maps (which is almost always the preferred type)
renderer.shadowMapType = THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap;</pre>"

  title: "[Three.js] Shapes and Geometries"
  post: "<p>Although it's possible to create any shape/geometry/mesh you want in Three.js, there are a few basic ones ready for immediate use, that will prove sufficient most of the time. We've already seen the box briefly, but there's so much more to it!</p>

<h2>Box</h2>

<p>A BoxGeometry can be used for any type of cuboid (3D square, rectangle, etc.). </p> 
<pre data-lang="javascript">var geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(width, height, depth, widthSegments, heightSegments, depthSegments);</pre>
<h2>Sphere</h2>

<p>A sphere is the other obvious basic shape: a 3D circle/ball.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(radius, widthSegments, heightSegments, phiStart, phiLength, thetaStart, thetaLength)
</pre>
<p><em>What are those last 4 parameters</em> <em>about?</em> you might ask. Well, these are useful if you want incomplete spheres. The <strong>phi</strong> start and length determine the amount of vertices sweeping around the Y-axis. The <strong>theta</strong> start and length determine those around the Z-axis.</p>

<h2>Plane</h2>

<p>The third basic 3D object that's always mentioned, is the plane. A plane simply is a ground or wall - a flat square. If you for example want to create a grid-based game, the plane's your man!</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var geometry = PlaneGeometry(width, height, widthSegments, heightSegments)</pre>
<h2>Polyhedrons (multi-planes)</h2>

<p>In this category, we have multiple tastes: <em>tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron, polyhedron. </em>The first three are simpler ways to create common polyhedrons, the last one can be used to create anything.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var geom = new THREE.TetrahedronGeometry(radius, detail)
           new THREE.OctahedronGeometry(radius, detail)
           new THREE.IcosadhedronGeometry(radius, detail)

           new THREE.PolyhedronGeometry(vertices, faces, radius, detail)

//The radius specifies the radius of the geometry
//Detail adds more vertices, setting this to more than 0 makes it technically not a polyhedron anymore

//And the polyhedron requires you to set the amount of vertices and faces it will build the geometry from</pre>
<h2>Cilinders and Tubes</h2>

<p>You know them: those shapes with a circle at the bottom,  and at a certain height the same circle straight above it. And tubes have the same, but with a hole in it.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var geom = new THREE.CylinderGeometry(radiusTop, radiusBottom, height, radiusSegments, heightSegments, openEnded)

//You can set a different radius for top and bottom
//Specify a height
//Determine the amount of segments (setting it to a high value will make it appear to be a circle, lower values make for other shapes)
//openEnded: boolean determining if the end is open or capped, default is capped (=false)</pre>
<p>The tube works a bit differently:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var geom = new THREE.TubeGeometry(path, segments, radius, radiusSegments, closed)

//Set a path and rotate it around radius with the amount of segments specified.
//And you can determine if you want it closed or open.
//(documentation on this one is practically non-existent, sorry)</pre>
<h2>LatheGeometry</h2>

<p>And last but not least, the lathe. You can set a path, and it will rotate this path around an axis, creating a radially symmetrical object (read: good for apples, oranges, vases, donuts, pipes, etc.).</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var geom = new THREE.LatheGeometry(points, segments, phiStart, phiLength)

//Points: An array of Vector3s. Since Lathe rotates around the Z-axis, Y-values can be set to 0.
//Amount of segments (again, determines how smooth it looks)
//Starting angle, and length (default is 0 and 2PI, a full circle)</pre>
<h2>TextGeometry</h2>

<p>A nice 3D beveled text every now and then looks really nice. And you can make them, very easily.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var geom = new THREE.TextGeometry(text, parameters)

/*
text: The text that needs to be shown. 
parameters: Object that can contain the following parameters.
	size — Float. Size of the text.
	height — Float. Thickness to extrude text. Default is 50.
	curveSegments — Integer. Number of points on the curves.
	font — String. Font name.
	weight — String. Font weight (normal, bold).
	style — String. Font style (normal, italics).
	bevelEnabled — Boolean. Turn on bevel. Default is False.
	bevelThickness — Float. How deep into text bevel goes. Default is 10.
	bevelSize — Float. How far from text outline is bevel. Default is 8.
*/</pre>
<h2>However..</h2>

<p>If all of that doesn't suit your needs, you can just go the traditional way, and model something in a 3D program (try Blender, it's free, and just as good as the others) and import it to Three.js</p>"

  title: "[Three.js] Material Madness!"
  post: "<p>Three.js comes with a few basic materials that will, most of the time, fit your needs. But if you need special shaders, you can write them yourself in GLSL ((Web)GL Shader Language), and hand those to the engine.</p> 
<h2>MeshBasicMaterial</h2>
<p>This material shades geometries in a flat or wireframe way. With this material, you can basically give a 3D object a certain color, and it will just be that color, nothing more (no shadows/reflection/gradient/whatever). And if you set the wireFrame property to true, it will render the wireframe of the object instead (which is typically used for debugging).</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( parameters )

//Parameters is an object which can have a lot of properties, but you'll probably only need:
//color: the color of the material
//wireframe: set to true if you want to display the wireframe of the geometry</pre>
<h2>MeshLambertMaterial</h2>
<p>Unlike the basic one, this material is capable of shading an object based on light sources and shadows.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial( parameters )
</pre>
<h2>MeshPhongMaterial</h2>
<p>The phong material is especially useful for shiny surfaces.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var material = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial( parameters )

//This material has one special property to set in the parameters object:
//shininess: a number, default is 30</pre>
<h2>MeshFaceMaterial</h2>
<p>This takes an array of materials, and puts each on a single, seperate face!</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var materials = //some array containing all sorts of materials...
var cubeMaterial = new THREE.MeshFaceMaterial(materials);</pre>
<h2>Common properties among materials</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that every material does something else completely, there are lots of common properties among the materials (they all inherit from the parent Material class). Among them are:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//We've already covered color and wireframe!
.ambient

//Ambient color of the material, multiplied by the color of the AmbientLight. Default is white.

.specular

//Specular color of the material, i.e., how shiny the material is and the color of its shine. Setting this the same color as the diffuse value (times some intensity) makes the material more metallic-looking; setting this to some gray makes the material look more plastic. Default is dark gray.

.shading

//How the triangles of a curved surface are rendered: as a smooth surface, as flat separate facets, or no shading at all.
//Options are THREE.SmoothShading (default), THREE.FlatShading, THREE.NoShading.

.fog

//Define whether the material color is affected by global fog settings. Default is true.

.reflectivity

//How much the environment map affects the surface; also see "combine".

.refractionRatio

/.The index of refraction for an environment map using THREE.CubeRefractionMapping. Default is 0.98.

.combine

//How to combine the result of the surface's color with the environment map, if any.
//Options are THREE.MultiplyOperation (default), THREE.MixOperation, THREE.AddOperation. If mix is chosen, the reflectivity is used to blend between the two colors.

.bumpMap
//Bump maps can be generated from textures, and when included with the original one, gives a flat 2D texture a very realistic 3D look without having to model the 3D object to it.</pre>
<p>If you want anything regarding <em>transparency</em> for your object, you need to remember to set two things:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Set the transparent flag to true
someMaterial.transparent = true;

//A value between 0.0 and 1.0 for opacity (= alpha= transparency)
someMaterial.opacity = someValue;</pre>
<h2>Is that all we can do?</h2>
<p>No, that's not all. You can write your own shaders/materials in any way you like! However, for this you need to learn a new programming language; <em>GLSL</em>. This will be discussed later in this course."

  title: "[Three.js] Tutorial for Professionals!"
  post: "<p>If you've read the beginner and advanced tutorials, you can create all basic types of objects and make them appear via lightning and materials. Here I'll teach you how to take it one step further and create some more varied visuals.</p> 
<h2>Fog</h2>
<p>Fog applied throughout the whole world:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Fog(color of the fog, min distance to apply fog, max distance)
scene.fog = new THREE.Fog( hex, near, far )</pre>
<h2>Different Cameras</h2>
<p>Next to the perspective camera we've introduced earlier, there's also an <strong>orthographic camera</strong>. This displays the world as though it was 2D, so it's best use would be for a 2D game or the 2D GUI/HUD of a game.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">// left, right, top, bottom, near, far
var camera = new THREE.OrthographicCamera( width / - 2, width / 2, height / 2, height / - 2, 1, 1000 );

scene.add( camera );</pre>
<p>And last but not least, cameras come with the useful feature <strong>lookAt</strong> to make it look at certain points (Vector3's) in the world or objects.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//It's useful to first set the 'up' value for the camera, to make sure it's properly rotated
camera.up = new THREE.Vector3(0,0,1);

//Then make it look at the origin
camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0,0,0));</pre>
<h2>Textures</h2>
<p>Every material has a certain <strong>.map</strong> property, which you can assign a certain texture you loaded earlier (you'll learn about loading stuff in a second). Like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var cubeTexture = //some image loaded here.. (you'll learn that in a few paragraphs)
var cubeMaterial = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ map: cubeTexture });</pre>
<p>Another possibility is to draw something using JavaScript's canvas and then assign that as a texture. The following code draws a canvas with black/white stripes alternating and then creates a texture from it:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var canvas  = document.createElement( 'canvas' );
canvas.width = 32;
canvas.height    = 64;
var context = canvas.getContext( '2d' );

context.fillStyle = '#ffffff';
context.fillRect( 0, 0, 32, 64 );

for( var y = 2; y < 64; y += 2 ){
  for( var x = 0; x < 32; x += 2 ){
      var value   = Math.floor( Math.random() * 64 );
      context.fillStyle = 'rgb(' + [value, value, value].join( ',' )  + ')';
      context.fillRect( x, y, 2, 1 );
  }
}

var texture  = new THREE.Texture(canvas);</pre>
<h2>Loaders</h2>
<p>There are a few things you're most likely to be loading throughout your Three.js career: images, materials and 3D objects made in external software.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Images
new THREE.ImageLoader.load(url, onLoad, onProgress, onError);

//Materials
new THREE.MaterialLoader.load(url, onLoad, onProgress, onError);

//3D Objects
//You'll most likely need an exporter for your 3D software to export your creations to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, used a lot in HTMl5 games)
new THREE.JSONLoader.load(url, onCompleteCallback, pathToTexture);</pre>
<h2>Particles</h2>
<p>Particles are very small parts of something that you need a whole bunch of (like snow, rain, glitters, confetti, etc.). To make this as efficient as possible, we need to put all the particles in one geometry, so we need to only make one call to Three.js to create a particle system out of it.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Create an empty geometry object
var particles = new THREE.Geometry;

//Add 2000 'particles' at random positions, and pass them to the geometry as standalone vertices
for (var p = 0; p < 2000; p++) {
    var particle = new THREE.Vector3(Math.random() * 500 - 250, Math.random() * 500 - 250, Math.random() * 500 - 250);
    particles.vertices.push(particle);
}

//Create a basic particle material, setting color and size
var particleMaterial = new THREE.ParticleBasicMaterial({ color: 0xeeeeee, size: 2 });

//Create a system from geometry and material (just as with meshes)
var particleSystem = new THREE.ParticleSystem(particles, particleMaterial);

//Add the system to the scene
scene.add(particleSystem);


//And for the sake of this example, put this in the looping render function to make it all rotate
particleSystem.rotation.y += 1/60;</pre>
<h2>Rays</h2>
<p>Rays are an often overlooked, but really really useful and essential part of 3D gaming. A ray is basically an invisible line from a certain point, in a certain direction, through the scene. This line then checks which objects it collides with, and you can do something with that information (often used for getting 3D coordinates in a world from a 2D mouse position, or for checking whether or not there's something in front of an AI enemy, so it doesn't bump into everything all the time).</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var rayCaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
rayCaster.set(startingPosition, direction);

//startingPosition can be any array of x,y coordinates, or simply playerMesh.position
//direction is a Vector3(x,y,z). Often though, if you see it's not working, you'll need to .normalize it

//Check for intersection (returns array of all objects)
//obstacles is a group of objects it must check collision with
var collidingWith = rayCaster.intersectObjects(obstacles);</pre>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Sadly, Three.js doesn't come with some useful built in methods or functions for handling user input. But, lucky us, there's some genius out there (Jerome Etienne) who's made all sorts of Three.js plugins (which he calls THREEx).</p>
<h5>Mouse/Touch Events</h5>
<p>Get the THREEx Dom Events Extension <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.domevents/blob/master/threex.domevents.js">at this page</a></p>

<p>Then you need to include it at the top of your page:</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><script src='threex.domevent.js'></script></pre>
<p>First, instantiate a new DOM Events layer:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Requires the current camera and renderer
var domEvents   = new THREEx.DomEvents(camera, renderer.domElement)</pre>
<p>The extension works just like event listeners: you can add an event on a function, and if you don't need it anymore you can remove it.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Add an event listener for a click on a certain object
someMesh.on('click', function(){
    //Execute code block here
    someMesh.scale.x *= 2;
});

//To remove it, simply use...
someMesh.off('click', callback);

//Currently supported events:
click, dblclick, mouseup, mousedown, mouseover and mouse out</pre>
<h5>Keyboard events</h5>
<p>Again, download the plugin <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/data/THREEx/THREEx.KeyboardState.js">here</a></p>

<p>Include it with your page's header:</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><script src='THREEx.KeyboardState.js'></script></pre>
<p>Then, instantiate it:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var keyboard = new THREEx.KeyboardState();</pre>
<p>Then check whether a key (or combination of keys is pressed)!</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Combination of SHIFT and P
if(keyboard.pressed("shift+P")) {
     pauseGame();
}

//Just P
if(keyboard.pressed("P")) {
    drawPistol();
}

//If you don't need it anymore, destroy the listener
keyboard.destroy();</pre>
<h5>Trackballcontrols</h5>
<p>Trackballcontrols? Trackballcontrols. It's an extra script from the Three.js author himself that you can include, and it enables you to zoom in/out and pan and move around the scene with the camera. It's not enormously useful in most games, but invaluable when debugging.</p>

<p>Get the trackballscript <strong><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/examples/js/controls/TrackballControls.js">here</a> </strong>(and include it, you know the drill)</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Create new controls variable containing the trackballcontrols, applied to a certain camera
//Then set some properties, and that's it!
controls = new THREE.TrackballControls( camera );

controls.rotateSpeed = 1.0;
controls.zoomSpeed = 1.2;
controls.panSpeed = 0.8;

controls.noZoom = false;
controls.noPan = false;

controls.staticMoving = true;
controls.dynamicDampingFactor = 0.3;

controls.addEventListener( 'change', render );</pre>

  title: "[Three.js] Physics with Physijs!"
  post: "<p>There are many great javascript physics engines out there, but PhysiJS was made specifically for Three.js, so I think it's the best fit.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>First, get the necessary file(s) <a href="http://chandlerprall.github.io/Physijs/">on GitHub</a></p> 

<p>To add Physijs to a Three.js project, you simply need to follow a few easy steps.</p>

<p>But first of all, don't forget to add a <script> tag that points to the physi.js file.</p>
<h2>Requiring core libraries</h2>
<p>That header sounds intriguing, but it's nothing more than including the following two lines in your code (PhysiJS depends on the famous ammo.js javascript physics library):</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">Physijs.scripts.worker = '/js/physijs_worker.js';
Physijs.scripts.ammo = '/js/ammo.js';</pre>
<h2>Some small alterations</h2>
<p>Then, instead if initiating a Three.js scene like you always do, create a Physijs scene (this is exactly the same as a Three.js scene, but with a physics layer built on top of it):</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">scene = new Physijs.Scene();</pre>
<p>And when you're creating a mesh, instead of calling any of the THREE.Mesh types, call one from the Physijs ones, for example:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">// Box
box = new Physijs.BoxMesh(
   new THREE.CubeGeometry( 5, 5, 5 ),
   new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x888888 })
);
scene.add( box );</pre>
<h2>Make it all work!</h2>
<p>And last but not least, next to the render call for the Three.js renderer, we need to call the physics system to make its usual iterations and check for collisions and what not.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">scene.simulate();</pre>
<h2>Scene configuration</h2>
<p>When creating the Physics scene, you can configure it a little. When calling new Physijs.scene(), you can pass in an object as the parameter. This object can have these properties:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var scene = new Physijs.Scene({fixedTimeStep: (1/60), blabla});

//Attributes to pass in the object
fixedTimeStep (default 1 / 60) //How much time one simulation step takes to simulate
reportsize (default 50) //If you know how much objects your world will have, you can set this to optimize

//Methods to call on it
setGravity (default Vector3( 0, -10, 0 ) ) //Sets the direction and strength of the gravity
setFixedTimeStep //Resets the timestep dynamically (do not call it every frame!)

//The simulation call also can take a parameter:
//The maximum steps/iterations the physics system is allowed to perform (more = even more accurate collisions, but slower performance)
scene.simulate({ maxSteps: someValue});</pre>
<h2>Please note!</h2>
<p>There are a few things you need to keep in mind all the time when adding those physics to your Three.js Here's a small list:</p>

<h5>No scaling after creation</h5>

<p>Once you've created a physics mesh from some geometry, you cannot scale it afterwards. However, before that moment, you can scale it anyway you like.</p>

<h5>Notify the system when things have changed outside the physics system</h5>

<p>If an object needs to change position or rotation manually, you need to tell the system you've just changed it. Don't worry, Position/rotation change from the Physijs engine (like bouncing, gravity, etc.) is taken care of already. You need to set these flags to true:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">mesh.__dirtyPosition = true;
mesh.__dirtyRotation = true;</pre>

<h5>Creating static objects</h5>

<p>Objects that are always going to be static, simply need to have their mass set to 0.</p>

<p>Objects that will sometimes be static, and other times be dynamic, need to have the following applied:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Completely freeze an object
object.setAngularFactor = THREE.Vector3(0,0,0);
object.setLinearFactor = THREE.Vector3( 0, 0, 0 );

//You can also clear any velocities the same way (setting them to a 0 vector3)
object.setAngularVelocity
object.setLinearVelocity

//To reset, simply change the factors back to Vector3(1,1,1);</pre>
<p>Now you can go on to the second part of the 3D Physics section!</p>"

  title: "[Three.js] More Physics!"
  post: "<p>Now it's time to create your first meshes with a fully functional physics body! (and more of course)</p>
<h2>Basic Shapes</h2>
<p>Below are the most common shapes Physijs currently supports (there are a few more, but those are not important right now)</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>Physijs.PlaneMesh</code> - infinite zero-thickness plane</li>
	<li><code>Physijs.BoxMesh</code> - matches <code>THREE.BoxGeometry</code></li>
	<li><code>Physijs.SphereMesh</code> - matches <code>THREE.SphereGeometry</code></li>
	<li><code>Physijs.CylinderMesh</code> - matches <code>THREE.CylinderGeometry</code></li>
	<li><code>Physijs.ConeMesh</code> - matches <code>THREE.CylinderGeometry</code> (tapered)</li>
	<li><code>Physijs.CapsuleMesh</code> - matches <code>THREE.CylinderGeometry</code>, except has two half spheres at ends</li>
</ul> 
<p>To use these, you'd simply replace <strong>THREE.Mesh</strong> with one of the Physijs equivalents you'd like to use. Then, as usual, you'd supply the <strong>geometry and material,</strong> and later <strong>add it to the scene. </strong></p>
<p>Do note though, that<strong> THREE.PlaneMesh</strong> and <strong>Physijs.PlaneMesh</strong> are not completely analagous - the plane from Physijs is infinite. If you really want a Three.js plane with physics, use a very thin BoxMesh.</p>
<p>Also, <code>Physijs.CapsuleMesh</code> is usually good for humanoid player characters. Just saying.</p>

<h2>Collisions</h2>
<p>Checking for collisions, is as simple as adding a collision event listener to a mesh.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">mesh.addEventListener( 'collision', function( other_object, relative_velocity, relative_rotation, contact_normal ) {
    // `this` has collided with `other_object` 
    // with an impact speed of `relative_velocity` and a rotational force of `relative_rotation` 
    //and at normal `contact_normal`
});</pre>
<p>However, there's always a certain problem when dealing with computer physics. It's possible that an object moving with a very high velocity collides with another object inbetween iterations/steps, and therefore no collision is detected. For performance reasons, the solution for this is automatically turned off by the physics system. But if you know some mesh will be moving with an enormous speed, you can turn it on and off yourself:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">// Enable CCD Motion Clamping if the object moves more than 1 meter in one simulation frame
mesh.setCcdMotionThreshold(1);

// The object gets an sphere inside of it to use for CCD, you can set the radius here (must be smaller than the object)
mesh.setCcdSweptSphereRadius(0.2);</pre>
<h2>Collision Materials</h2>
<p>Physijs can give some extra properties to a material, and thus to an object. These attributes are <strong>friction </strong>and <strong>restitution (bounciness)</strong>. These need to be set in a special Physijs material:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Values between 0.0 and 1.0
var friction = .8;
var restitution = .3;

//Physijs Material - a three material/shader, friction, restitution
var material = Physijs.createMaterial(
    new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x888888 }),
    friction,
    restitution
);

//Just apply it to the mesh like you always do
var mesh = new Physijs.BoxMesh(
    new THREE.BoxGeometry( 5, 5, 5 ),
    material
);</pre>
<h2>Callbacks &amp; Events</h2>
<p>Because Physijs runs on a different thread than your main application, there is no guarantee that it will be able to iterate the scene every time you call <code>scene.simulate</code>. Because of this, you may want to attach an event listener to the scene that is triggered whenever the physics simulation has run.</p>

<pre data-lang="javascript">var scene = new Physijs.scene;
scene.addEventListener( 'update', function() {
    // the scene's physics have finished updating
});</pre>
<p>Additionally, if your scene is complex or has a lot of objects, the physics simulation can slow down to the point where adding new objects can become a lot of work for the application. To help alleviate some of the pain this may cause, objects have a </span><code style="color: #333333;">ready</code> event which is triggered after the object has been added to the physics simulation. </p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var readyHandler = function() {
    // object has been added to the scene
};
var mesh = new Physijs.SphereMesh( geometry, material );
mesh.addEventListener( 'ready', readyHandler );
scene.add( mesh );</pre>
<h2>Compound Shapes</h2>
<p>If you want to mix multiple shapes together into one object, which is used more often than you think, that can be done quite easily. It works exactly the same as in Three.js: you create the parent, then the child you want to add to it, and then you add this little line of code:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">parent.add( child );
scene.add( parent );

//Remember, add all childs before adding the parent!
//And, child's positions are local/relative to the parent</pre>
<h2>Constraints</h2>
<p>There's a very good (and long...) wiki page on constraints by the creator of Physijs himself, and I didn't find a way to simplify and/or expand on it in this tutorial, so you can just go the the page here: <a href="https://github.com/chandlerprall/Physijs/wiki/Constraints">Constraints Physijs</a></p>"

  title: "[Three.js] Animation/Movement!"
  post: "<p>Now that you've learned a lot about creating all sorts of things and setting them up in Three.js, you'll want to know how to perform actions on these objects!</p> 
<h2>The Basic Setup</h2>
<p>In the first few tutorials of this series you already learned to set up a render loop in JavaScript. The part between <em>requestAnimationFrame()</em> and <em>renderer.render()</em> is where you'll put all your code from this lesson.</p>

<p>The way this works is that the loop runs at the highest FPS your browser can handle at that moment (with maximum at 60), and every time the loop runs, your code is executed. That means that for a FPS of 60, your scene is updated 60 times per second.</p>

<p>So if you wanted to move a cube 100 units in world space along the x-axis (depends on from where you're viewing how much pixels this is!), you'd put into the render frame:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">theCube.position.x += (100/60);</pre>
<h2>But, the FPS can change right?</h2>
<p>Yes, I've already mentioned that FPS depends on how much is in the scene and how much your computer can handle. Therefore, it's unwise to use a fixed number for FPS.</p>

<p>Instead, Three.js provides a <strong>clock </strong>class. How it works is: you create a clock object, and start it at the start of your program. Then every rendered frame, you can get the amount of seconds that has passed from the clock.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Create clock, set autostart to true
var clock = new THREE.Clock(true);

//Within the render() function
//Get the seconds elapsed since last getDelta call
var timeElapsed = clock.getDelta();
//Or get the amount of time elapsed since start of the clock/program
var timeElapsed = clock.getTimeElapsed();</pre>
<p>Once that is all set up, you can change your cube-moving code to:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">theCube.position.x += 100 * timeElapsed;</pre>
<h2>Tweening</h2>
<p>The previously mentioned techniques creates linear motion/animation for your objects, and that's not always what you want. For creating nice tweened animations, there is a tiny, awesome extra JS library called <strong><a href="https://github.com/sole/tween.js">tween.js</a>.</strong>. We are going to work with that here.</p>

<p>Don't forget to include the library before you test any of the code!</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><script type='text/javascript' src='tween.js'></script></pre>
<h5> Create basic tween</h5>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Set position and target coordinates
var position = { x : 0, y: 300 };
var target = { x : 400, y: 50 };

//Tell it to tween the 'position' parameter
//Make the tween last 2 seconds (=2000 milliseconds)
var tween = new TWEEN.Tween(position).to(target, 2000);

//Now update the 3D mesh accordingly
tween.onUpdate(function(){
    mesh.position.x = position.x;
    mesh.position.y = position.y;
});

//But don't forget, to start the tween
tween.start();

//And also don't forget, to put this into your looping render function
tween.update();</pre>
<h5> Do even more awesome stuff</h5>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Delay the start of the tween
tween.delay(500);

//Set a different tweening (easing) function
tween.easing(TWEEN.Easing.Elastic.InOut);

//Create a chain of tweens
//For example: this one loops between firstTween and secondTween
firstTween.chain(secondTween);
secondTween.chain(firstTween);
</pre>
<p>A list of all the different easing functions can be found here: <a href="http://sole.github.io/tween.js/examples/03_graphs.html">31 Easing Functions</a></p>

  title: "[Three.js] Beginners GLSL Tutorial"
  post: "<p>GLSL stands for (Open)GL Shading Language. It's the programming language used for OpenGL/WebGL shading, and it's incorporated into the Three.js library. Of course, this language is also applicable anywhere else you intend to use WebGL, but I'm focusing on Three.js here. It's kinda like C, but specialized in shaders (so a lot of functions for vectors).Basically, what you can do with GLSL is determine what the shader does when it is run on a certain geometry. And what a shader does, can be nearly anything.</p> 
<h2>The Shading Pipeline</h2>
<p>When we're shading a 3D scene, there are multiple different stages in the pipeline. We're able to completely modify two of these stages, the <em>vertex shader</em> and the <em>fragment shader</em>. This image presents a basic overview of the pipeline:</p>

<img src="media/ShaderPipeline-01.png" />

<p>As you see, first the basic code is loaded on the CPU's part. Then, it passes on the geometries for all objects (and camera/light info) to the GPU.</p>

<p>This GPU receives them, and send each vertex through the <strong>vertex shader</strong>. Here you can modify them in any way you like.</p>

<p>Then the modified vertices are send back, and some operations are performed to determine which object is in front, clipping occurs outside of the camera's view, etc. What's left then, is send to the<strong> fragment shader</strong>, which basically gets a lot of triangles, and has to determine the colors for each pixel in them. These are sent back and properly displayed on the monitor.</p>
<h2>Uniform, varying and attribute</h2>
<p>What's also shown in the diagram, are weird types of variables. These are three different types of variables (like local, global, static, etc. - but different) used in GLSL.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Uniform</em>, is a variable that is the same for both shaders. For example, the light's position and color. Therefore, it is also read-only.</li>
	<li><em>Varying</em>, is  passed in to the vertex shader, then <strong>modified</strong>, and then the new value is passed to the fragment shader. For example, if you change the positions of vertices, you also have to change their normals (which are given to and used by the fragment shader) so shading works correctly.</li>
	<li><em>Attribute</em>, is only available in the vertex shader, and is read-only: they are standard variables for a vertex' position, normal, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Basic Shader</h2>
<p>The most basic shader you can get, simply leaves the vertex positions as they are and gives the whole object one overall color.</p>

<p><strong><em>Vertex Shader </em></strong><em>(gl_Position)</em><strong><em>:</em></strong></p>
<pre data-lang="glsl">//Here's the space for variables

//The built-in main function
void main() {
  //Every vertex shader must eventually set 'gl_Position'
  //And in this case, we multiply the vertex position with the camera view and screen matrix to get the final output.
  gl_Position = projectionMatrix *
                modelViewMatrix *
                vec4(position,1.0);
}</pre>
<p><em><strong>Fragment Shader </strong>(gl_FragColor)<strong>:</strong></em></p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Again, space for variables

void main() {
  //Just as vertex shader, fragment shader must in the end set this variable (gl_FragColor)
  //We set it to a pink color.
  gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0,  // R
                      0.0,  // G
                      1.0,  // B
                      1.0); // A
}</pre>
<p>This shader simply displays the object with a color, nothing more, nothing less. The vertex shader leaves the position as it is, and gives it to the fragment shader. This one gives the fragments their colors and we're done!</p>
<h2>But, where do we put shader code?</h2>
<p>Good question! There are multiple possibilities, but the one that's used the most is by putting the shader code into '<script>' tags, and using jQuery to get the text out of it and use it for the material.</p>
<pre data-lang="html">//Vertex Shader Code
<script id="cubeVertexShader" type="x-shader/x-vertex">
    //codehere...
</script>

//Fragment Shader Code
<script id="cubeFragmentShader" type="x-shader/x-fragment">
    //codehere...
</script>

<script>
//Getting the text out of it
var vShader = $('#cubeVertexShader').text();
var fShader = $('#cubeFragmentShader').text();

//Or, for non-jQuery kind of people
var vShader = document.getElementById('cubeVertexShader').innerHTML;
var fShader = document.getElementById('cubeFragmentShader').innerHTML;
</script>
</pre>
<h2>And the final bit: add it to the scene</h2>
<p>Last but certainly not least: we must add the shaders together into a material Three.js can use.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Create a new Shader Material with our code powering it
var itemMaterial = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
    //Optional, here you can supply uniforms and attributes
    vertexShader: vShader,
    fragmentShader: fShader,
});

//Create a new item with our material
var item = new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.CubeGeometry(100, 10, 10), itemMaterial);</pre>
<h2>That's...the basics.</h2>
<p>You haven't really accomplished much. I'm not saying this to make you feel bad about yourself, I mean: we've just recreated what can also be done with a Three.js standard material. Now, it's time to start adding lots of more fun, and we do exactly that in the next part.</p>"

  title: "[Three.js] GLSL Advanced Tutorial"
  post: "<p>In the previous tutorial, you learned all about setting up GLSL and how it works (the fundamentals). Now, I'll show you how you can do special things with it!</p> 
<h2>Define variables</h2>
<p>At the top of a shader, above the <i>main</i> function, we define the different variable types I mentioned earlier (varying and uniform). If you define a variable in one shader, you have to define it in the exact same way in the other shader as well! When creating a new variable in GLSL outside of the main function you have to state its GLSL-type and its normal/usual type. This sounds weird, but that basically means: uniform/varying/attribute + float/int/vec3/etc. Like this:</p> 
<pre data-lang="glsl">//This bit is the same in vertex and fragment shader
varying vec3 vNormal;
uniform vec3 uLightDirection;

void Main() {
    //blabla..
}</pre>
<p>It's common practice, to put a little 'v' or 'u'  in front of varyings and uniforms respectively, so you know what type something is by looking at the name. If you then define variables inside the Main function, it works the same way, but you just leave out the first bit (varying/uniform).</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you create a <em>float</em> variable, it wants all its input in float numbers! So don't use a 1 or 0, use 1.0 and 0.0</p>

<h2>Do something with 'em!</h2>
<p>I'm just going to show you how this works with an example. This example creates some 'fake' shading on an object. We first pass the normal for every vertex to the fragment shader (this works because interpolation of normals occurs between the two), and then use that and a custom light we set to create shading.</p><p><strong>Vertex Shader:</strong></p>
<pre data-lang="glsl">//This variable will contain the normal
varying vec3 vNormal;

void main() {
  // 'normal' is a standard value provided by Three.js for every vertex
  // just as 'position'
  vNormal = normal;

  gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
}</pre>
<p><strong>Fragment Shader:</strong></p>
<pre data-lang="glsl">//Declared in exactly the same way as Vertex Shader
varying vec3 vNormal;

void main() {
  //Create a vector to determine where light comes from 
  // (similar to directional light in this case)
  vec3 light = vec3(0.5, 0.2, 1.0);

  //Normalize it 
  light = normalize(light);

  //Calculate 'dot product'
  // and clamp 0->1 instead of -1->1
  float dProd = max(0.0,
                    dot(vNormal, light));

  //And output this color.
  gl_FragColor = vec4(dProd, dProd, dProd, 1.0);  //RGBA

}</pre>
<p><em>What's this <strong>dot product</strong>?</em> The dot product, is an often used (and therefore built-in) function that calculates the cosine between two vectors. If the normal and light vector are equal (point in same direction), this returns 1 (fully lit). If they are completely opposite, this returns -1 (which we make 0.0, and is completely dark).</p>

<p><em>What's the <strong>normalize</strong> for?</em> Normalize shrinks all three values of the vector down to a value between 0 and 1. This must be done to calculate the dot product. If one of the vectors is not normalized, then the equation does not work properly. Now you should have a nicely shaded 3D object!</p>
<h2>Passing through attributes</h2>
<p>Now we've seen some uniforms and varyings in action, but where are those attributes? Well, those are usually passed in from the HTML page - you can also input uniforms from there. First you create a JS Object that will contain all the attributes, then inside that you create another new object for every attribute that holds the type and value. Then, you pass it into the Shader. Like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">//Attributes
//Every element of the array corresponds with the vertex of the same index
var attributes = {
  displacement: {
    type: 'f', // a float
    value: [] // an empty array
  }
};

//Uniforms
var uniforms = {
  amplitude: {
    type: 'f', // a float
    value: 0
  }
};

//Create final ShaderMaterial
var shaderMaterial =
    new THREE.MeshShaderMaterial({
      uniforms:       uniforms,
      attributes:     attributes,
      vertexShader:   vShader,
      fragmentShader: fShader
    });</pre>
<p>Then of course, you also need to define these variables at the top of the shader(s) so that they are properly received, and then within the Main function you can use them for whatever you want!</p>
<h2>Data Types!</h2>
<p>GLSL supports a few basic data types, and a few specifically useful ones when working with 3D graphics:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>int</strong> integer (0,1,10,-5,etc.)</li>
	<li><strong>float</strong> floating point number (0.2, -0.5, 15.6, 4/3, etc.)</li>
	<li><strong>bool</strong> boolean (true or false, 0 or 1)</li>
	<li><strong>vec2, vec3, vec4</strong>: vectors of length 2,3,4 respectively</li>
	<li><strong>mat2, mat3, mat4:</strong> matrices of 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 respectively</li>
</ul>
<p>GLSL is optimized for throwing vectors together, so for example a vec4 can be created by saying vec4(someVec3, 4thvalue). Also, you can multiply a vec3 with a single float variable (<em>scalar</em>) without the program throwing all sorts of errors. This will simply multiply each component of the vector seperately.</p>

<p><i>How could there ever be a 4-dimensional vector?</i></p>

<p>Well, any vec4 in GLSL has the properties RGBA or XYZW you can get/set, depending on your interpretation.</p>

<p>RGBA works for colors: a red, green and blue channel, and an <em>alpha</em> (opacity) channel).</p>

<p>XYZW works for actual points and vectors: the x, y, z coordinate, and the fourth W value decides what type it is (because something with an x, y and z could be both  a vector and a point). Vectors have 0, points have 1. And then you might think 'why didn't they just create different functions for vectors and points?' Because using this fourth value helps a lot when it comes to using <i>matrices</i> (which is what the computer does a lot)..</p>
<h2>Built-in methods</h2>
<p>All the usual methods are built into GLSL: if/else statements, for loops, do while loops, etc. However, I recommend you try to avoid if/else statements as much as possible. They are (relatively) heavy on the GPU, and as seen that for now performance/steady FPS is the major bottleneck in most 3D web apps, you'll want to optimize performance as much as possible. It also has the other standard (math) functions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>sin, cos, tan, atan</strong></li>
	<li><strong>pow, exp, log, exp2, log2, sqrt, inversesqrt</strong></li>
	<li><strong>abs, floor, ceil, mod, sign, min, max, clamp</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>(if you don't know some of these, look them up, they can really help you out sometimes.)</p>

<p>Next to that, there are <strong><em>GLSL-specific (vector) functions</em></strong>. You've already seen <strong>normalize</strong> and <strong>dot product</strong>, and here's the rest:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Length</strong> (length()): Returns the length of the vector that's put into it.</li>
	<li><strong>Distance</strong> (distance()): Returns the distance between two points put into it.</li>
	<li><strong>Cross product</strong> (cross()): Returns the axis of rotation between two vectors, i.e. the vector that is perpendicular to both vectors.</li>
	<li><strong>Reflect</strong> (reflect()): Reflects a vector (needs the incoming vector, and a vector representing the normal of the surface).</li>
	<li><strong>Refract</strong> (refract()):<strong> </strong>Refracts a vector (needs the incoming vector, normal of surface, and ratio or refraction).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Textures!</h2>
<p>To add textures to your shader, are multiple steps are required. First. you must use Three.js to load a texture to a variable. Then you pass this data as a uniform variable to the shader. Then within the shader you must pass the UV coordinates of every vertex to the fragment shader, so that the latter can use both variables (texture and UV) to access the correct part of the texture to display. Sounds complicated? Not really, just look at this code:</p>

<p><b>For the main page/javascript:</b></p>
<pre data-lang="javascript">var tex = THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture('/path/to/texture.png');
//optionally set some settings for it
//tex.magFilter = THREE.NearestFilter;

//Create the material, pass in the texture as a uniform with type 't'
var mat = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
    uniforms: {
        theTexture: {type: 't', value: tex}
    },
    vertexShader:vShader,
    fragmentShader:fShader,
    //Set transparent to true if your texture has some regions with alpha=0
    transparent: true
});</pre>
<p><b>Vertex Shader:</b></p>
<pre data-lang="glsl">//A varying that gets the UV coordinates and gives them to the FS
varying vec2 vUv;

void main() {
    //Get UV coordinates
    vUv = uv;
    //As always, keep position as is
    gl_Position = projectionMatrix *
                  modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0 );
}</pre>
<p><strong>Fragment Shader:</strong></p>
<pre data-lang="glsl">//Same varying to retrieve UV coordinates 
varying vec2 vUv;
//A uniform of type 'sampler2D' with the same name as was used in Three.js
uniform sampler2D theTexture;
 
void main() {
    //Get the color from the texture by using texture2D()
    //And as always, set it to the fragment's color
    gl_FragColor = texture2D(theTexture, vUv);
}</pre>
<p>It's that simple! Well, for simple textures. If you want to go crazy, I suggest you pick up a good book on the math behind 3D computer graphics.</p>
<h2>And now?</h2>
<p>Now you've learned the basics of GLSL. But of course, there's much more! You could animate the uniforms you put into the shader, add normal and bump maps, create awesome materials, anything you like!</p>

<p>However, I must leave you on your own here. Experiment yourself and create inspiring 3D graphics and shaders!</p>"

  title: "[Soccer] The Very Basics"
  post: "<p>This article will explain the basic structure we'll be working with in this course, and a bit of the terminology that will be applied.</p>
<h2>Different play modes</h2>
<p>When playing soccer, there are basically 3 different 'playing states' you can be in:</p> 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Defending:</strong> The opponent has the ball and is trying to score against you. You are trying to prevent this from happening.</li>
	<li><strong>Attacking:</strong> Your team has the ball, but not you. You're now trying to get into good positions to make sure your team keeps the ball and to keep the attack going</li>
	<li><strong>You have the ball:</strong> Your team is attacking, and now you have the ball. This is of course the most important moment to you, as you now need to decide whether to shoot, pass, or start dribbling/running. Most of this guide will be about how you can improve your own skills, but never forget the importance of knowing what to do when the other two states are current.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Different touches</h2>
<p>As you know, in soccer you're not allowed to use any part of both arms. The rest of the body can be used however you like. However, the parts most often used (as they provide the best control) are <strong>thighs, chest, head </strong>and of course your <strong>feet</strong>. You'll learn about using the other parts later (in 'receiving the ball'), now I'll just tell you all the different ways you can control or touch a ball with your foot.</p>

<img src="media/SoccerTouches.png" />

<ul>
	<li><strong>Inside</strong> The inside of your foot is the part most people learn to use as they grow up, as it is the easiest and most natural movement. The inside of your foot can be used for anything (passing, shooting, dribbling), as it is the most accurate touch (but slower than others).</li>
	<li><strong>Outside</strong> The outside of your foot is the hardest to learn and use. This too can be used for anything, it just makes the ball move and bend in the opposite direction.</li>
	<li><strong>Laces</strong> Your laces refer to the upper part of your shoe. Shooting with this part of the foot gives you a lot of power, but sacrifices in accuracy. With combination of laces+inside/outside you can make a ball spin and go enormously fast at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Heel</strong> The heel is almost never used, because it requires some unnatural leg movement and much training to pull it off. You can do a backheel volley, but that's very hard, and it's best use is therefore a simple backheel pass on ground level.</li>
	<li><strong>Bottom</strong> The bottom of your foot is used for stopping and trapping a ball under your foot. It's often deployed to receive and control a pass, to protect the ball or as part of a certain trick to get past a defender. Also, in very tight situations in front of goal, you can slide or karate-jump towards the ball and hit it with the bottom. Success not guaranteed.</li>
	<li><strong>Toes</strong> You should never hit a ball with toes only, as that gives zero control or power, and it hurts very much. However, just as the bottom of the foot, it can be a decisive move to just slightly redirect the ball to get it where you want.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some definitions</h2>
<p>Before we continue, just a few things to clarify what we're talking about all the time:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Kicking Foot: </em>The foot that swings and kicks the ball</li>

<li><em>Standing Foot (Non-Kicking Foot): </em>The foot that stands still and next to the ball as the other one performs the kicking.</li>
</ul>"

  title: "[Soccer] Shooting & Passing Fundamentals"
  post: "<p>Shooting and passing is what you'll be doing 50% of the time. The other half is used by your ball skills. But, the one thing that decides matches, is goals, and you can't get those without shooting and passing. So I suggest, if you're really a beginner when it comes to soccer, you learn to pass and shoot really well before you continue to do anything else, because - if you have the ball, and you can shoot but not dribble, you can score goals or give the perfect pass to a teammate. If you can't shoot, but you can dribble...you can dribble all you want, it's not going to help.</p> 
<h2>Basics of every shot</h2>
<p>Whatever type of shot you're going to pull off, you need to do a few thing:.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Give yourself some space.</strong> Find some open space, put the ball there in a nice position, and get your body aligned correctly as well. Also, already know and imagine where you want the ball to go and which kick you're going to use, if you decide or have doubts later on, you'll never perform well.</li>
	<li><b>Put down your planting foot</b>. Now place your non-kicking foot besides the ball, not too far away, but keep room for the swing. Make sure the planting foot is <b>pointing towards the target,</b> and your <strong>knee slightly bend. </strong>It depends on the type of shot how far before/after the ball you should place your foot.</li>
	<li>(Optional, but very much recommended) <b>Get your arms out</b>. Get your arms out, any way you like. However, the common way, is to move the <b>non-kicking foot arm</b> diagonally <strong>back and up a bit</strong>. The <strong>other arm </strong>is diagonally <strong>down and forward</strong>. What do arms do? They give extra balance, extra momentum and keep away any defenders.</li>
	<li><strong>Initiate the swing (back).</strong> Actually, you should do that while planting your other foot firmly into the ground. As you put down the non-kicking foot, your kicking foot is already off the ground and swinging back (you can't run with two feet on the ground, can you?). Use this momentum to swing it back even more, because a lot of people are afraid to do this and tense up and do a very short swing, which isn't good at all. However, don't overdo it, as this will only hinder you and put you off balance.</li>
	<li><strong>Unleash the power.</strong> Now you start to quickly move your leg forward. Your upper leg should move first, until your knee is roughly above the ball. Then, you need to add even more power and start the actual shot by swinging your lower leg to the ball, using the desired touch. This two-step leg movement should be done in a fluent motion, and not look like some sort of robot.*</li>
	<li><b>Follow through.</b> Now, depending on the shot, comes the follow through. After your first contact with the ball you continue to move your kicking foot in a certain direction and to a certain extent, to add more power, levitate the ball, add curve, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>*The advantage of this motion, is that it requires good swinging technique to do, and it adds more power and accuracy (because the moment you hit the ball, is the moment your leg is at full speed and locked). So, make sure you don't have a stiff leg when shooting, and you  don't hit the ball too early or late in your swing by following the tips!</p>
<p>Of course, you can add your own little tweaks here and there, but try to stick to this basic, correct technique as much as you can. The next two posts will be about passing and shooting respectively, explaining all the different possibilities and types more in-depth.</p>

  title: "[Soccer] Passing"
  post: "<p>Passing is used to get the ball to your teammates, which means it shouldn't be too difficult for them to get to and control/receive the ball you send their way. Therefore, good passing technique usually resides in giving the ball moderate speed and moderate (or no) spin. In theory, there are 3 methods used for passing: <strong>ground push</strong>, <strong>cross</strong>, <strong>air lob.</strong></p> 

<p>NOTE: When passing, the inside of the foot is almost always used. However, most people tend to quickly get their foot into normal (toe pointing forward) position when shooting, resulting in you hitting the ball with a weird combination of inside, toe and laces. So, remember to really keep your foot almost at a 90 degree angle with the normal position at the moment of hitting the ball.</p>

<h2>Ground Push</h2>

<p>This is the simplest and most used one. It isn't necessarily a shooting technique, as it's more like pushing the ball straight to your teammate. To do it, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Place the planting foot right beside it, at a good distance (rather too close than too far away though).</li>
	<li>Swing to the ball, hit it with the <strong>inside of your foot</strong>, not really with your foot or toes, but with the <strong>part of your ankle</strong>. This keeps the ball as straight/curveless and low as possible.</li>
	<li>Optional improvement detail: Move your foot a bit upwards, so that your toes point up. This really stops the ball from going up, and gives it that slight curve often seen in soccer.</li>
	<li>Follow through then doesn't really matter, but it's best to create the habit of always following through very well.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cross</h2>

<p>Crossing the ball is used when trying to get the ball from one part or side of the field to the other. Around midfield it's used to switch the play from left to right or vice versa, and sometimes from one side to the other AND forward (diagonally). Close to the opponent's goal however, it's used to swing the ball into the box from the left/right, to the head or foot of your teammate. It goes like this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Run to the ball at an angle. Running straight to it, makes it very hard to create good spin and height, as you impede your own ability to swing.</li>
	<li>Crosses need to have height, either a bit or lots of it. Therefore, place your non-kicking foot a bit before the ball (closer to yourself), so that you lean back when you hit the ball. But remember to keep your shooting technique the same, so that you still get good contact. This leaning back, makes you scoop the ball a bit, and together with a nice follow through into the air, this gives the ball some nice height.</li>
	<li>Swing, and hit the ball with the <strong>inside</strong> of your foot. This time, you don't want to use the part close to your ankles, but rather the part of your foot <strong>between ankle and toes.</strong> This is the biggest part with the most surface and control.</li>
	<li>When you first hit the ball, you hit it more at the bottom, at the 'corner' closest to you. Then, as your swinging continues, you move your foot upwards to hit the top far-corner just before the ball is released from your foot. Because of the angle of the run-up and your touch, you should have enough contact time with the ball to do this. However, because we want some nice spin and height, follow through is really important here.</li>
	<li>As you're striking the ball, turn your whole (upper) body with your swing, so that at the end of the shot, you're facing your target in all ways possible.</li>
	<li>So, what your foot is basically doing, is curling around the ball while hitting it, so that the ball takes over this curve when it's struck. But, make sure you're not striking it too much to the side to get the curve, as this really messes up your shot.</li>
	<li>Additionally, you'll want to play around with the amount of curve and height. Hitting the ball more with the toes results in higher shots, with less curve. If you have a lot of curve, you might consider making your non-kicking foot point a bit beside the target to make up for it. If you don't get enough height, follow through more and lean back more.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lob</h2>

<p>A lob pass, is a straight pass through the air, with some backspin. So, it has no (sideways) curve, which makes it easier to predict and place well, and it has a bit of backspin to make it go quite high and down again quickly. '<em>Why don't they use this all the time then?', </em>you might wonder. Well, there are two sides to the story: being easier to predict, makes it easier to receive and control for your teammate, but also easier to defend or block. On top of that, it's a bit harder to pull off. So here it goes:</p>

<p>There are actually two techniques, and one is often called <strong>chipping</strong> and the other <b>lobbing</b> the ball. With chipping, you count on hitting the ball with the right part and positioning your body correctly to make it succesfull. It also has <em>a lot</em> of backspin, and less speed. When doing a lob pass, you're basically trapping the ball between your toe and shin and taking it with you in the swing, and then releasing it when your follow through has ended. This creates a straight ball, high in the air, (relatively) very fast, and almost no spin. Both types have their advantages and disadvantages, you can decide for yourself which you like or use (chipping is discussed in the shooting section though).</p>
<ol>
	<li>Lobbing requires a straight run up (or 90-degree turn towards the box when performing it if you're going for some cross-lob combination, but that's a lot harder to do).</li>
	<li>Place your planting foot right next to the ball. With a lob, you're going to want full control over the ball until you release it. Therefore, putting the non-kicking foot too much before it gives you a great chance of having the ball bounce off your foot when trying to perform it. At the other end, placing it too much behind the ball makes it impossible for you to get the ball up into the air.</li>
	<li>Now swing your leg at it, while your toes are pointing down. You'll want to control the ball with the <strong>laces</strong>. But, you don't want to shoot it, so try to get your toes back pointing forward once you've hit the ball, so that it stays on your laces.</li>
	<li>Then you follow through as much as you can and keep your toes pointing forward. At a certain moment (though the later, the beter), the ball will fly off your laces, and into the air.</li>
	<li>If you want the ball to go high, simply try to get your foot as high as possible on the follow through. If you want the ball to mainly go forward (and fast), lean forward a bit on the follow through, and land on your kicking foot to help yourself. You might also try keeping your toes pointed a bit more downward, but that might go wrong and result in a blazing fast shot.</li>

  title: "[Soccer] Shooting"
  post: "<p>Shooting is different from passing, in the sense that you want to give the ball a one-way ticket for a direct line towards the goal. You don't expect any teammate to touch it, and you don't want the goalkeeper or any defender to block or deflect it. Therefore, either enormously fast or greatly curved shots are preferred (or a combination, if you're getting really excited). Usually, goals are scored from inside the box or <em>just</em> outside it. However, it is perfectly possible to score from more distance, but then you'll need to be able to shoot very fast with lots of accuracy, and even some curve if you want to show off.</p> 

<p>If you have the time, your best bet will usually be to do a <strong>bending shot </strong>(curving/spinning). This requires a bit of a setup, and isn't as fast as other shots, but it can curl the ball around the goalkeeper (and other obstacles) into the goal. Also, it makes it harder for the keeper to save, because he has to predict the curve of the ball.</p>

<p>However, if you have a straight shot at goal, the best option would be a <strong>lace shot </strong>(driven/instep). This is the fastest shot available, and can be shot in a perfectly straight line, and therefore be struck with great accuracy. In professional soccer though, most people also give the ball a nice swerving curve with this shot, which makes it seem like it's going into one corner, but it actually goes towards the other.</p>

<p>And last but not least, there's the <strong>chip shot</strong>. This is used when the goalkeeper (and any last defenders) are a good distance away from goal and about halfway between you and the goal. This shot then simply lifts the ball over them, out of their reach, and makes it come down to get under the crossbar and score a goal for your team.</p>

<p>Also, it's better to shoot wide than high. If the ball is too high, the ball will simply fly over the goal. If it's wide, there's a good chance the ball is deflected, pushed away by the keeper for a corner or that a teammate will pick the ball up. Furthermore, if you want to hit the upper ninety with your shot, it's better to keep the shot a bit lower and make it go in just below that sweet spot, than to just blast away and shoot the ball over the crossbar 90% of the time, with no chance of ever scoring.</p>

<p>The best spots to strike your ball home to therefore, are actually the lower corners. It's hard for a goalkeeper to dive far when he has to do it on the ground, and there's more chance of the ball going into the net. After that, the most goals are scored by shooting the ball through the keeper's legs, or just past him. It's hard for a goalkeeper to reach to a ball that's very close to him (but not right at him), especially when he can't really see it coming. And only after that, are most goals scored by shooting it into the upper corners.</p>

<h2>Bending shot</h2>

<p>In the <em>passing</em> section we already discussed the <strong>cross</strong>. The cross is not much different from it, only in the fact that the bending shot usually gets more curve and speed. This is possible, because the shot shouldn't get much height, so the power of the kick goes into the other factors. Therefore, all you have to change is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Place your standing foot less behind the ball, and more next to it. You can also place it before it if you want a ball on the ground, but that can quickly result in inability to freely swing your leg.</li>
	<li>Try to get a bit more on your laces: lean into the ball/forward a bit.</li>
	<li>And try some more curve: make your kicking foot go back to 'toes-forward mode' as quick as possible, but retain proper technique ( = the right touch). When done correctly, this adds more spin to the ball, but also gets the ball more onto the laces and moving forward, instead of going up.</li>
	<li>And if you've got that under control, you can try if you can put your momentum into the shot and make your leg swing so much inwards (in the follow through) that your whole body spins around with it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lace shot (and outside)</h2>

<p>This shot is all about enormous power, but I recommend you first get the technique down really well, because even an only slightly misplaced touch can result in the ball flying all over the place with this shot. I'll split the shot into two seperate forms: straight ones, and curving ones struck with the outside of the foot. So pay attention now:</p>

<h5>Straight</h5>
<ol>
	<li>A straight run up, though an angle is perfectly possible.</li>
	<li>Place your standing foot right beside the ball, or even more forwards if you want to keep the ball low.</li>
	<li>Now swing your leg back, and while you swing forwards, <strong>keep your toes pointed down</strong> and <strong>lock your ankle</strong> for as long as you can. Hit the ball with your <strong>laces</strong>, and make sure you make full contact (and don't just poke it with the toes).</li>
	<li>Then follow through, still with toes pointing downwards, and then end this fluent motion with <strong>landing on your kicking foot</strong>.</li>
	<li>This should send the ball straight forward with enormous speed, and with some height (depending on how you place your standing foot, how much you lean forward/backward and how long you keep your toes down).</li>
	<li>At first, many people hit the ball too much on the left or right side of the foot. This isn't useful at all - make sure you hit the ball with the center of your foot (or a bit to to the left of that if that's too difficult).</li>
	<li>Also, most people are afraid of injuring their foot (or mostly their toes) when doing this shot. This only increases bad shooting habits, like straining the leg, holding back, hitting it incorrectly - so don't be afraid. However, these fears are not totally unfounded - there's a chance your toes collide with the ground if you don't watch out. So, first practice shooting with minimum speed but with proper technique. Only after that go wild and make that ball fly.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Outside curving shot</h5>

<p>This shot basically works the same, but with a few crucial differences:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The run up is at an angle. Also, your standing foot will not really be pointing at the target, but a bit away from it (to allow room for the other leg to swing inwards).</li>
	<li>Then, it's a common misconception that you must hit the ball with the outside of the foot to make it curve that way. No, you must hit the <strong>outside of the ball</strong> with all of your <strong>laces</strong> (try to get as much contact as you can, but on the outside of the ball).</li>
	<li>So basically, you're swinging your foot inwards and hitting the outside of the ball with your laces, steering it into the other direction (almost perpendicular to your standing foot).</li>
	<li>Success with this type of shot relies on hitting the outside of the ball with as much as you can, without making it into a straight shot (there's a fine line there). And on following through (in the same direction as your standing foot is pointing) very well.</li>
	<li>Also, some people rotate their foot a bit towards the ball in the follow through, and 'scoop' it a bit and make it more into an outside foot lob shot. That's perfectly possible, but is harder to do than the standard method.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Chip shot</h5>

<p>The chip shot is actually used 80% of the time in passing, and less in shooting. But, because there is a variant that is more useful for shooting than passing, I discuss both methods here in the shooting section. As stated earlier, the chip shot makes a ball go high into the air, and come back down quickly due to the backspin.</p>

<h6>Variant 1 - Used most for passing</h6>
<ol>
	<li>A slightly angled run up is useful.</li>
	<li>Place your standing foot a bit before the ball, so that you lean back when shooting.</li>
	<li>Then swing your kicking leg at it, and hit it with the <strong>inside</strong> of your foot, with the part of your <strong>toes</strong>. The more you can hit it with your 'big toe', while still remaining decent contact, the higher it will go.</li>
	<li>Then, instead of following through, you can just stop the motion after you've hit the ball. So basically with this shot, you drive your foot into the piece of grass right underneath the ball, and using the slope of the shoe at the contact part it will fly up into the air with a lot of backspin.</li>
	<li>The ball should go straight into the direction your standing foot is pointing. If it doesn't, your kicking foot is either angled inwards too much, or you hit it too much with other parts of the foot. If the ball doesn't get medium height when applying mediocre power, you're again hitting it with the wrong part of the foot or have positioned your standing foot too much ahead of the ball.</li>
</ol>
<h6>Variant 2 - Used most for shooting (chipping over the keeper, hard-to-get bouncy balls)</h6>
<ol>
	<li>A straight run up.</li>
	<li>Then you place your standing foot <em>ahead</em> of the ball, but make sure you don't start leaning forward with this shot.</li>
	<li>Now, swing your kicking leg at it, and you actually want to hit the ball with the same part of your foot (inside toes), but do this while the ball is 'behind' you.</li>
	<li>Then, you have an awful lot of space to follow through, as you've already struck the ball early in your swing. Use this, as it creates lots of backspin on the ball (and not necessarily height) when done correctly.</li>
	<li>Because of the downward movement of the foot at the moment you hit the ball, you don't really send the ball into the air, but force it to pop forward with some height. Therefore, you can't really get this ball very far, but it can go over the keeper, and it has that nasty bounce that can make it hard to defend against (and with times, can make it bounce over a defender's foot).</li>

  title: "[Soccer] Ball Skills"
  post: "<p>As said earlier, together with passing/shooting, ball skills make up the other half of your individual soccer skills. And when I talk about ball skills, I'm talking about being able to do whatever you want with any ball that comes near you. Receive it, have a good first touch, start running with it, dribble with it when there are defenders near, and perhaps do a nice trick if you see the time and space.</p> 
<h2>Receiving</h2>
<p>There are two ways to receive balls flying in the air: <strong>supporting </strong>and <strong>trapping</strong>. Receiving balls that just roll on the ground requires no specific or special technique, that's discussed further in the <em>first touch</em> section.</p>

<p>Receiving can be done with the <strong>feet</strong>, <strong>thighs</strong> and <strong>chest</strong>. The foot can then receive it with either the inside, laces, or outside. Inside is the safest, outside is sometimes needed and looks more awesome, and the laces are used if you want to quickly move forward when receiving the ball.</p>

<h5>Supporting</h5>

<p>Supporting means that you make the ball land on you. You support the ball with some part of your body, so that you can let it drop dead to the ground after you've managed to receive it well. So here, you put your body underneath the ball, make it bounce up a bit, and land right in front of you for further use.</p>

<h5>Trapping</h5>

<p>Trapping the ball is the opposite of supporting it. You put some part of your body on top of the ball at the moment of contact, so that you deflect the ball towards the ground. With feet this gives you great control as the ball's got almost nowhere to go when you trap it, but with other parts of your body the ball can bounce off a bit more wildly.</p>

<h2>Good first touch</h2>
<p>A good first touch is more important than everyone thinks, because it allows you to immediately put the ball into the right spot for yourself, and it's the easiest way to go past one or two defenders near you. A good player can go any way with his first touch, which makes it hard to defend against.</p>

<p>NOTE: The tips we gave you about receiving the ball earlier count here, this section only explains which way to move the ball on receiving it.</p>

<p>Keep your eyes on the ball at all times, or you'll not even be aware of a ball coming to you. That's...mostly embarassing, I think. Last of all, always check for defenders near you before receiving a ball!</p>

<h5>With open space in front of you (towards the opposition's goal)</h5>

<p>On receiving the ball you'll want to immediately push it forward (either straight or a bit diagonally), as this makes the attack a lot faster. Even if you meet a few defenders only 10 meters further, you can simply pass to somebody else or backwards, and you'll have gained a little bit more ground on the opponent's half of the pitch.</p>

<h5>When your back is turned (towards the opposition's goal)</h5>

<p>If that's the case, I first have to say to you: don't ever let this happen! Always try to stand in such a way that you see the ball, but at the same time the other side of the pitch (often this means standing on the sideline if you're a winger, or standing diagonally). But if it happens, turn <em>before</em> you receive the ball. If you see the ball coming, already turn a bit one way or another, and turn even more with the ball once it's come to you. Of course, if you see there are defenders near as you turn, the ball is usually quickly passed back to where it came from.</p>

<h5>With defenders behind you</h5>

<p>Move your arms out, to defend the ball and feel where the defenders are. If you notice the ball is moving a bit slowly, move towards the ball yourself, or your defender will be there before you and intercept the pass.</p>

<p>Then, once you've received the ball, there's two things you can do on your first touch. Either make it go left or right and hope you're faster than your defender, or immediately stop the ball and shield it (while you wait for some passing options, or you're preparing your next amazing trick).</p>

<h5>In every other situation</h5>

<p>In situations where there's some defenders, and some open space, you'll have to decide the best course of action yourself. If you see a gap somewhere, it's best to exploit it on your first touch. If you see a teammate running in good position, pass it immediately on first touch. If you see no way, it's better to pass the ball backwards or to the sides than trying to squeeze yourself through the opposition's defense.</p>
<h2>Dribbling</h2>
<p>Dribbling is a vague term, as it means 'moving with the ball, without actually moving it much'. It sits between protecting the ball/standing still and running with the ball. What players often do, is run with the ball, and then some time before they hit a defender, they slow down and start dribbling. They do some fancy movements, slowly move the ball into different directions, until they think they see space and blast past a defender or give that golden pass. Dribbling is basically the simplest way to give yourself space and time and to get past defenders, while tricks are the harder way. So, how is it done?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Firstly, you must remember to keep the ball underneath your body (not in front or behind it) at all times. It's tempting to keep it behind you so the opponent cannot reach it, or to have it in front of you because you can see it easier that way, but don't do that. That simply makes it harder for you to reach the ball.</li>
	<li>Then, you must learn to only use <strong>sideways lace touches</strong>. Never dribble the ball while touching it with the toes, or inside, or outside, or full laces. No, you want to use a combination of <strong>inside+lace</strong> for going left, and <strong>outside+lace</strong> for going right. This is achieved by pointing your toes down a bit, but not fully (like with the lace shot). And, you can rotate the foot a bit in the right direction, but there's generally not much room for movement in that part of the foot. These touches give more control over speed and direction</li>
	<li>However, sometimes you're more in the mood for some straightforward dribbling, but then you'll be surprised that this is also done with these touches. Either you can angle your foot more, so that instead of left/right it goes almost straight, or you can use the <strong>standard dribbling technique</strong>. I recommend the latter.</li>
	<li>Standard dribbling technique means using a variation of left/right to move in a certain direction. If you're varying your touches with inside/outside while moving straight, you can go left/right any moment. This makes it hard for a defender to get you, because if he steps in to tackle, you're able to dodge it easily.</li>
	<li>Then, make sure that you <strong>touch the ball </strong>every time you move your foot. So, if you take the ball to the left, and then you need to take a few steps without touching it (because it's too far away), that's bad, because that's the moment the defender can easily step in and take the ball away. Prevent this, by moving the ball a bit every time you touch it, so that you move as though the ball was glued to your foot.</li>
	<li>Optional, but highly recommended: Learn to do the basic movements with your <em>weak foot</em> as well. Lots of professional soccer players can only pass and shoot with their right foot, but dribble/run/receive with their weak foot also. Why is this so useful? You're unpredictable, and it allows for the <strong>two-foot-touch</strong>. This technique is simply starting with the ball around one foot, and then passing the ball to the other foot, and then quickly dribbling the other direction with the other foot. This gives you two times the normal movement in about the same amount of time.</li>
	<li>And then some simple logic: if there's a defender on your right side, move and dribble with the ball on your left (and vice versa). If there's a defender in front of you, put the ball through its legs or burst to the left or right.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running</h2>
<p>When I say running (with the ball), I don't mean dribbling at full speed. Dribbling at full speed can be very fast and disastrous for the opponent, but I already explained how to do that (all you need to do is perfect the technique and get fast).</p>

<p>First, let's discuss running without the ball. In soccer, at any moment, you may have to bend your run, receive a ball, jump into the air to perform a header, etc. Therefore, you need to have balance and control at any time. Running in soccer means that you keep your (upper)<strong> body straight</strong> all the time and at the same time <strong>look at the ball</strong>. When in open space you make extremely long strides, when more people are around you must take smaller steps. While running, <strong>move your arms</strong> with you. This can create room around you, and it gives you more balance and speed.</p>

<p>Another action that calls for great running technique is em>counter attacking</em>. Say you've just received the ball and have an enormous amount of space to run into.  Remember you still need to keep the ball underneath you, but this time you can hit it with <strong>laces only</strong>. This sends it straight, and fast. Then, once in about two or three steps you touch the ball again. To make yourself able to run this way with your body in perfect position, you'll have to run on your toes really and with ankle locked while your foot is in the air.

  title: "[Soccer] Headers"
  post: "<p>Many people don't realize how important headers are in the soccer game. But the truth is, that lots of passes, crosses and goal kicks fly up into the air and are to be headed. Heading is a skill that is harder to learn than you might think, but it's also the one of the most valuable ones to learn. Heading doesn't involve just striking the ball with the right part of the body, no, you'll also have to win duels with defenders, jump high, get enough power, and give it the right direction.</p> 

<p>NOTE: Before I move on, I must say that heading is very dangerous when done wildly and incorrectly!</p>

<p>Heading doesn't mean just putting your head against a ball, no, there's a lot of technique involved:</p>
<ol>
	<li>First, you'll notice the ball is coming at you, and you'll estimate when it will be at the right level for you to head it. You move to that spot (if you've never done this before, getting a ball in the face is not unheard of - it's important to get this part about positioning right). Depending on how high the ball is, and whether or not there are defenders near you, you may decide to do a jumping header, for which you have to position yourself a little closer to the ball.</li>
	<li>Now, load your weapons! Just as with shooting, you have to swing or pull something back, in order to get power once released. So, <strong>keep your neck and head straight</strong>, and move your <strong>upper body backwards.</strong></li>
	<li>Once you think it's the right time to head the ball (you need to keep your eyes open and fixed on the ball, otherwise you'll probably be too early), you move your upper body forward (and your head with it of course), and hit the ball with your <strong>forehead</strong>.</li>
	<li>And now, if you want to give the ball some direction, you need to rotate your neck towards your target (rotating your body doesn't necessarily help), while the ball is still touching your head.</li>
	<li>Now you should have performed a nice and clean header!</li>
	<li>You'll need to keep in mind that any ball that hits your forehead will move upwards, so keep/move your head a bit down if you want the ball to go low, which is mostly useful for scoring (very often, headers from corners go over the crossbar because of the lack of proper technique).</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you know how to perform a header, but what if there's people around you that also want the ball for themselves? Use these tips:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Get your arms out - make yourself big and stand on the ground firmly. Make sure that your opponent can't get in front of you, but also can't push (or pull) you in any direction.</li>
	<li>In the case of a goal kick (or another slow but very high ball) you want to stand <strong>behind</strong> your opponent. This is because these balls are quite impossible to control, so standing behind the other player either makes the ball fly back a lot towards the opposition's side of the pitch, or it simply flies into your territory and possession.</li>
	<li>In any other case though, you want to either be <strong>in front</strong> of your opponent, or you want to <strong>jump higher/above</strong> him.</li>
	<li>When close to the opponent's goal, there will be defenders pushing and pulling you. You need to either shake them off of you by running around a lot, or be strong enough to get them off your back. Then, once the ball comes, use the technique I described earlier to score.</li>
	<li>When defending in front of your own goal, you want to head the ball high and away (and of course, now you're the one pushing the other players). Preferably, you want to head the ball towards the sides, because if you deflect it to somewhere in front of goal, there's a chance an opponent picks it up and shoots the ball into the net.</li>
	<li>However, keep in mind: it's never allowed to put elbows/arms into other player's faces, or to lean or jump onto them in any way. Although, it depends a lot on the type of arbiter and how intense the game is.</li>

  title: "[Soccer] Defending"
  post: "<p>Usually, the casual soccer player defends by just running to the guy with the ball at his feet and trying to get his leg in between there somehere. Though part of this technique can be useful, it's of course not the best way to go. It drains the energy from you (you're running all the time), you can easily make fouls, and the opponent can even more easily dodge you and have free space to run into.</p> 

<p>There are a few things a defender must be able to do: <strong>intercept/block</strong>, a <strong>standing tackle</strong> and a <strong>sliding tackle.</strong> Of course, positioning and marking plays a big role here, but that's described in the 'off-the-ball movement' section.</p>

<h2>Defending Fundamentals</h2>

<p>So, you've got an attacker moving somewhere near you. First, you must learn to wait. Don't rush to him, try to <strong>estimate where he will end up</strong>, and get there moving at <strong>about the same speed as him</strong>. This makes you able to either perform a tackle, or quickly run with the attacker if he changes direction or does some sort of trick. If you run towards him too fast or too slow, the attacker will be able to dodge you or move past you with a simple acceleration. Also remember, to always <strong>stay on your toes, </strong>as this makes you able to quickly change direction.</p>

<p>So, now you're running at the proper speed, and you're at the point where you're going to bump into the attacker. You'll now want to stand <strong>diagonally</strong>, between the player and the goal (blocking a straight line to the goal). Lower yourself a bit (a lower center of gravity gives you more balance, strength and agility - but less speed), and keep your eyes fixed on the ball, and the ball only, Whatever fancy moves the opponent makes, only the ball can truly show you where the ball is going.</p>

<p>Now, the attacker has the option to try and move past you left or right (cutting outside or inside). If he moves too close to you, or waits too long, you can perform the <strong>standing tackle</strong>. Otherwise you'll have to run with him and either block his shot/pass or get him off the ball with standing/sliding tackle if he loses control over the ball for a second. You're allowed to use some of your strength and body to take the opponent off the ball, but not very much, because that results in you making a foul. Other moments where <strong>sliding tackles</strong> are preferred, are when you're coming from an angle at a player with high speed, and you see the opportunity for a clean sliding*, do it! Otherwise, it can be a last resort to block a pass or stop a player in dangerous position, but be careful with that.</p>

<p>* This means: you're pretty sure where the ball is going to end up (and the player is not going to end up, which is the case when a player is running with the ball and can't change direction quickly.</p>
<h2>Standing Tackle</h2>
<p>The standing tackle is the easiest one. It can be executed if you're close enough to the ball to stick one foot out (while still standing on the other one) and kick the ball away or take it for yourself.</p>

<p>Standing tackles are performed with the <strong>inside </strong>of the foot, as this is the strongest part with the most surface. Basically, all you need to do is put this part of the foot to the ball, and make it go in any other direction than the attacker who first had the ball wanted it to go.</p>

<p>However, sometimes you'll make contact with the ball at the same time as your opponent, or he'll have enough space to move quickly and make it hard for you to get the ball. Then, you'll need to do everything to come out of this duel as the winner, because you're the defender!</p>

<p>Therefore, you first need to learn to close in on the attacker. <strong>Make yourself big</strong>, and make sure that whatever direction the other player is going, he'll bump into you, or you'll be able to do a standing tackle with one of your feet. Then, once you see the opportunity, <strong>lean into the tackle</strong>. Move your whole body forward and use your mass to make sure the attacker doesn't simply push you away.</p>

<p>And then, to give it a nice finishing touch, you can learn to determine the direction you want the ball to go after the tackle and quickly run there to get the ball for yourself. If you just tackle, most times the ball will bounce out of bounds (and you were the last one to touch it), or fly back to another player from the opposition. A good rule to follow here, is that you want the ball to diagonally move away from your goal. This moves the ball towards the sides, and not back into the feet of the attacker. This puts your team immediately into attacking mode, and you're less likely to lose the ball (with disastrous consequences) there.</p>
<h2>Sliding Tackle</h2>
<p>A sliding tackle is a bit harder to do, and also has a few variations you'll need to master. Before we go on, a few things on performing safe sliding tackles:</p>

<p><strong>Keep your feet at ground level, always</strong>. Whatever you do, any foot that reaches the knee or even higher is not only a yellow or red card for you, but also a danger for the player receiving such a tackle.</p>

<p><strong>Don't hit the ball with the bottom of the foot. </strong>You may be tempted to slide to the ball, and kick it away to the side with the bottom of your foot. But, that's not smart, and also dangerous. You want to use your <strong>laces</strong> (but not your toes, watch out for that) to kick a ball away.</p>

<p><b>You don't always have to slide.</b> Although they look wonderful when done correctly, you don't have to do them all the time once you've mastered them. Most of the times simply running your man into dangerous territory or a standing tackle will suffice. Forcing the opponent to play the ball backwards is also a win.</p>

<p>So, now we can go on to: <em>how is it done?</em></p>

<p>Well, the first thing you must learn is of course the 'sliding' part. To slide, you need to have some speed, and then drop to the ground, sideways. While you do so, your <strong>lower leg</strong> (that's touching the grass), must be <strong>bend</strong> (so you're practically sliding on your knee/thigh) to get a good sliding movement. The upper leg is then stretched out and used for the actual tackle.</p>

<p>Another variation is where you do what I described above, but at the last moment you switch your lower leg to be stretched, and you upper leg to be bent backwards. This gives some extra power to the tackle, but has the disadvantage that you can only kick the ball far to the side this way.</p>

<p>That brings us to our last variation, where you keep the ball in possession. While you perform the tackle, wrap your foot around the ball, and quickly get on your feet and pull the ball towards you. This results in the cleanest possible tackle, because you keep the ball afterwards, and your tackle must be perfectly on the ball for it to succeed.</p>

<p>That's really all there is to it. Once you've got the basic technique, it just takes a lot of practice to get the timing, power and aiming right.</p>
<h5>Intercepting/blocking.</h5>
<p>This isn't really that hard, as it just means you must estimate how the ball will be passed or shot, and then get in the way (either with your body or by sticking a leg out). However, there are a few tips and tricks:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the ball is shot from up close, keep your hands behind your back to prevent yourself from making hands.</li>
	<li>If the ball is shot from the side of the pitch, you can use your leg and body to stop or deflect it.</li>
	<li>However, if you're in front of goal, you want to stand still where you are once a ball is struck. This way the goalkeeper can see the ball all the way and correctly estimate where it will end up. If everyone just hopelessly tries to stop it, the ball might deflect, and that renders the goalkeeper useless.</li>
	<li>If you're trying to intercept a pass, don't stand precisely between the ball and the man you're marking, but a little bit further to your own goal. This forces the opponent to pass the ball behind the other player, stagnating their attack.</li>

  title: "[Soccer] Off-the-ball Movement"
  post: "<p>Whenever you're not on the ball, the game is still moving. That means, you should be moving too. Whatever position you're playing, you can't just go sit down for a few minutes because they're busy on the other side of the pitch. Let's go over the roles for every type of player real quickly:</p> 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Defender:</strong> You're the last barricade the opponent must break through before he can score. Therefore, your job is to make sure you're always behind the ball, that you position yourself well and always mark your man. Then if you've stole the ball back for your team, it's your job to keep it and start building the attack.</li>
	<li><strong>Midfielder:</strong> The midfielders do a bit of defending and attacking. They must always be free to receive the ball, and run around a lot to achieve this. Whenever the ball is somewhere in their area, they must win it back or really put pressure on the opponent. And if you've got the ball, you must be able to pass it perfectly.</li>
	<li><strong>Attacker:</strong> Attackers are of course good for one thing: tearing the opposition apart and score the goal much-needed for winning the game. Therefore, they will not really help with defending, and stay somewhere around the opponent's line of defenders. Once the ball is in their possession or comes their way, the attackers try to make clever runs or dribbles or perform awesome tricks and passes to get closer to the goal, and then one of them will shoot.</li>

  title: "Complete Card Magic Guide"
  post: "<p>So, you want to impress friends, family, your crush, and anyone else with magic tricks? Well, you've come to the right place. Card tricks are the best ones to start with, because there are so many different tricks you can do with them, and all you need is a standard deck of cards (usually without jokers). What people usually do is teach you a complete card trick, from start to finish. But, what I will try to do, is teach you all the different components and basic tricks you can use with card magic, so you can assemble your own trick! However, if you just want to learn a trick from start to finish, I've got that covered as well.</p> 
<h2>What do we need?</h2>
<p>A standard 54-deck of cards. You can decide for yourself if you want to keep the joker(s) in there. Nothing else, the rest of it is just your own skill. There are, I must note, a lot of beginner card tricks that involve glue and pieces of paper and cards cut in half....but I find those the ugliest tricks ever, I only teach 'clean' tricks here. Not only does this make you a better magician, it also saves you a lot of work and money. And, you can perform your tricks with any deck given to you.</p>

<p>And of course, you need the right attitude! Learning proper card magic requires a lot of practice from your side. Cards may fall out of your hands, they can slip, tricks can go wrong because you accidentally did an actual shuffle (instead of a fake one)...it all happens, you just need to go on until you got it perfectly right. And when you've got it perfectly right, you can study a bit about <em>misdirection</em> to cover up the secret even more.</p>
<h2>The Basic Setup</h2>
<p>For the people who've seen the movie "The Prestige", this quote may sound familiar:</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">The first part of a trick, is called "The Pledge". The magician shows you something ordinary and asks you to inspect it.<br/><br/>The second part, is called "The Turn". The magician takes the ordinary thing, and makes it do something extraordinary.<br/><br/>But making something disappear, of course isn't enough. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, "The Prestige".</p>
<p>Well, sounds cool, but what's my point? That every card trick also has these three 'acts'. First, you show them the deck of cards so they see it's perfectly ordinary. You let them pick a card, study it, and put it back. Then, you do something extraordinary: you make the promise of retrieving the spectator's card. You shuffle the deck, make some cuts, perhaps do some other nice moves. And then comes the last part: you make the card come out of the deck! This can be in any way you like, by making it the top or bottom card, doing a nice reveal, letting the spectator grab the top card, etc. And that's the way you must also read this guide. I have tips and variations for every part...enjoy it!</p>
<h2>A Basic Trick</h2>
<p>But, to start you off, I present you a very basic trick you can already practice. For the spectators, it goes like this: they may choose a card, put it on top of the deck, you make a cut in the deck, and then you look into the deck and bring their card back! But for you, the magician, it goes like this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Shuffle the deck (really, no fake one).</li>
	<li>Let the spectator choose a card. But, while he does that, you look at the bottom card of the deck, and memorize it.</li>
	<li>Then, the spectator puts his card at the top of the deck, and you make a random cut. This means you cut the deck in half around the middle of the deck, and put the bottom half on top of the top one.</li>
	<li>What this does, is it places the bottom card on top of the top card (= the chosen card).</li>
	<li>Then, all you have to do, is turn around the deck and look through the cards until you find the card you memorized. The card before it is the card the spectator picked!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now of course, that is a very basic trick that anyone can see through after you've done it a few times. But it's a great example of how simple tricks can be, and it's an easy one to get you started with smooth card and audience control.</p>
<h2>Basic 'Sleight of Hand' Techniques</h2>
<p>There are several areas in 'sleight of hand' that can (and/or must) be implemented into a trick, namely:</p>
<ol class="toc">
	<li>Fake Shuffles</li>
	<li>Location Markers</li>
	<li>Passes & Breaks</li>
	<li>Card Forcing</li>
	<li>Card Hiding</li>
	<li>Card Revealing</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything else essentially comes from these basic techniques, so let's get started!</p>

<p>NOTE: We recommend you follow the guide in the order presented above, as we'll be heavily using some methods learned in earlier chapters in later ones.</p>"

  title: "[Card Magic] Fake Shuffles"
  post: "<p>A trick in its simplest form, is having a spectator put a card on top (or bottom) of the deck, then shuffle it (fake one), and show the audience (to its surprise) that the card is still on top. However, to not make the audience suspect anything, you'll need to learn multiple of these fake shuffles.</p> 
<h2>Controlled Shuffle</h2>
<p>The controlled shuffle makes you able to keep a card at the bottom or top. The rest of the deck is really shuffled. The controlled shuffle is almost the same as the basic shuffle everybody knows: hold the deck in your right hand, and take a portion from the back of the deck and throw them down at the other end, in groups. It works like this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you want to <strong>keep a card on top:</strong> The first time, instead of taking only a portion from the back, lift the entire deck, except for the top card. The top card will fall back, and you can put the whole deck on top of it. If done quickly, it's unnoticable. Then, you can just finish this shuffle, for the card will be at the bottom of the deck. The second round, do it the traditional way, and grab the back portion of the back and throw them in front. When you come to the last few cards, release them one by one so that the bottom card ends on top.</li>
	<li>If you want to <strong>keep a card at the bottom:</strong> Do everything the normal way, but when you come to the last few cards, don't put them in front but simply return those few to the back. Again, this might seem obvious, but when done quickly it will not be noticed. A variation on this, is that you vary between putting cards at the front and at the back. It works the same way: simply keep the bottom card in your hand, and only release the other cards.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Perfect Cut</h2>
<p>This technique, if done quickly, makes it seem like you're just cutting the deck at random places (because you are). But, the trick is in the fact that you return those bits of the deck in the exact same order you cut them, so that the complete order of cards in the deck remains exactly the same. Here it goes, step by step:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Take  the deck of cards horizontally with both hands, thumbs on the back side (pointing towards you) and the rest of your fingers on the other side.</li>
	<li>Then, take about 1/3 of the deck from the bottom with your right hand, and move it to the top. But, keep it seperated from the remaining cards in the other hand.</li>
	<li>Then, with your left hand, again take 1/3 of the deck from the bottom and move it on top of the other 1/3 you just moved. These don't need to be seperated. <em>(if you want to do the shuffle very quickly, it's wise to lift your index finger and already start with the next step)</em></li>
	<li>Then, move whatever's left in your right hand (seperated from the 2/3 above it), on top of that, and your deck is in the exact same order as it was before.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do it quickly and multiple times, and people think the deck is completely shuffled, while it's EXACTLY the same.</p>
<h2>Swivel Cut - Simple Flourish</h2>
<p>This one looks awesome, whatever you use it for. And, it keeps the complete order of the cards.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Take the deck into your right hand, vertically, thumb closest to you, the rest of your fingers at the side furthest from you. Your hand must be above the cards (so palm is facing the cards).</li>
	<li>Then, cut 1/3 of the top of the deck and throw it into your left hand (<strong>A</strong>).</li>
	<li>Then cut the remaining deck in two, again creating two cuts of about 1/3 <b>(B </b>and <strong>C</strong>, top and bottom).</li>
	<li>Then, switch <strong>A</strong> with C<strong>. </strong>So, C is now in your left hand and A underneath B in your right. Make sure to keep A and B seperate.</li>
	<li>Then comes the swivel: use the <strong>left index</strong> and <strong>right index</strong> to rotate <strong>B </strong>180 degrees while transporting it from your right to your left hand.</li>
	<li>Then throw the remaining cards in your right hand (A) on top of the ones in your left. And the order is restored to A,B,C.</li>
</ul>
<p>The swivel throws some nice style and elegance into the shuffle, and isn't too hard to learn.</p>
<h2>One-handed cut</h2>
<p>This method of cutting the cards serves two purposes: one is that it actually shuffles the cards and looks awesome, the other is that you can cut the cards quickly while distracting the audience with your other free hand. Here are the instructions for the <em>right hand.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Keep the deck in your hand horizontally with index finger on the left side, middle and ring finger on the top side, pinky on the right side, and thumb on the bottom side.</li>
	<li>Cut the deck in two (we'll call them <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, top and bottom), by applying only pressure to the top half of the deck with your thumb.</li>
	<li>Then release pressure from the index finger, and tilt your hand a bit so that <strong>B</strong> falls down into your palm, resting on your pinky.</li>
	<li>Then, use this free index finger to push <strong>B</strong> towards your thumb, so that B and A form a 90 degree angle.</li>
	<li>Once it's there, you can release your middle and ring finger so that <strong>A</strong> falls down into your palm.</li>
	<li>And then a little push with your thumb makes <strong>B</strong> fall down on top of <strong>A</strong>.</li>

  title: "[Card Magic] Location Markers"
  post: "<p>There are lots of different ways to mark the location of a card. There are two basic methods: marking the card itself, or marking the space/cards surrounding it so you can easily find the card.</p> 
<h2>Spotting Card</h2>
<p>The spotting card is the easiest: all you have to do is quickly look to the bottom of the deck and spot a card. While the audience is busy with something else (or you're using your misdirection skills), you simply take a quick look at the bottom and remember that card.</p>

<p>There's two ways this can come in handy: you can later make sure the card the audience picked is right next to this card, so you can easily find it (you're using it as a location marker). Or, you somehow move the chosen card to the bottom of the deck, and quickly look so that you know exactly which card the spectator picked. Then, you can do anything you like to throw off your audience, because you already know the card.</p>
<h2>Glide</h2>
<p>The glide simply requires you to glide a card backwards/out of the deck, so that you can easily move/locate it. The common way is to use a glide on the bottom card of the deck, but it can be done on any card.</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Bottom Card</em>: Use your pinky or some pressure from the palm to slide the bottom card backwards, toward you. It can be extended quite a bit, the audience can't see it if you do it properly.</li>
	<li><em>Other Cards:</em> This is a bit harder. Subtly lift the cards on top of the one you need (with your left hand, deck lies in right hand), and use your thumb to slide the card backwards. The technique is often used to pretend to grab a certain card, but in fact you grab a different one. For example, if you glide the bottom card, you can now easily get the 2nd to bottom card of the deck, while the audience thinks it's the bottom one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Keepsake</h2>
<p>This move is in some way the same as the glide, but has some extras attached to it and usually serves a different purpose. What you do is, you make the card your 'victim' picked subtly stand out of the rest of the deck. To make this invisible to the audience, it's best to make it really stand out at the back of the deck (the part that's facing you), and keep the front the same as always. As you might have guessed, a <em>glide</em> is needed somewhere in that move. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Putting a card back into a <span style="font-weight: bold;">fanned deck</span>:</em> You first let a spectator choose a random card from a fanned deck, (look at it), and then he must put it back somewhere in there. The trick is, to apply pressure with the thumb on the 'root' of the deck, so that the card can't be put back completely, a little bit sticks out. Then you can simply rotate the deck 180 degrees while squaring it (to cover this up). Then you have the card your spectator chose sticking out in the back.</li>
	<li><em>Putting a card back somewhere random in a deck: </em>This is the other way cards are often returned to the deck. When the spectator puts his card back, you simply perform a mid-deck glide: while you put the top half of the deck back, use the thumb of that hand to slide the top card of the bottom half (the chosen card) back a bit. You can also push the card a bit diagonally, so that the chosen card rests on top of your pinky for further use. This however is tricky, because a diagonal card in the deck is easier to spot.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Card Crimping</h2>
<p>This is not exactly one of my favorites, but it is also an often executed method. What you do is, once you have the spectator's card isolated from the rest of the cards (using perhaps the methods above), you <em>fold the right corner at the back of the card</em> a bit. Then, you can just put the card back in the deck, and you can easily spot it. Be careful though, to grab the card at this corner when you display it to the audience. While you're pulling out the card, you can slide your fingers a bit to make the crimp undone.</p>
<h2>Passes & Breaks</h2>
<p>Besides all of these, there are a few location marking techniques that can used for other things as well, and are much quicker and more powerful. Those are discussed in the next chapter."

  title: "[Card Magic] Passes & Breaks"
  post: "<p>Passes and breaks are essentially the same thing, but their relation is like this: a pass is created by doing a break. When you do a break, you subtly seperate two cards or two halves of a deck or whatever. When you seperate them, an open space is created (a <em>pass</em>age) for cards to be put in there or pulled out of it.</p> 
<h2>Pinky Break</h2>
<p>This is the most common break, because it is easily hidden. The end result is always that you have a deck in your hand that looks normal to the audience, but at the back you have your pinky stuck between there to mark a certain spot. To get there, you can use multiple techniques.</p>

<p>NOTE: For all pinky breaks, for them to look as natural as possible: tilt the deck a bit forward, put extra pressure on the top with your thumb, and don't put your whole pinky in between but only a 'bit of flesh' so to speak. This makes sure people mostly see the front and top of the deck and never notice that the back is a bit larger.</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">For seperating card(s) from the top. </span>Subtly move the top card(s) with your thumb towards your pinky. Lower the pinky to make the cards rest upon it, and then slide the cards back while holding the pinky between cards.</li>
	<li><em><span style="font-weight: bold;">OR</span> </em> apply a lot of pressure with your thumb at the top right corner. Use your middle finger (and perhaps the pinky too) to keep the bottom cards down. This way, the top cards' bottom left corner will jump up in the back so you can put your pinky in that gap.</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">For seperating card(s) from the bottom. </span>Simply lower your pinky, while keeping the other fingers at their place to avoid raising suspicion, and use the part right under your nail to break as many cards as you like.</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">For seperating card(s) somewhere in the middle. </span>Often, you randomly cut the deck and ask the spectator to put his card in there. There's no trick there, the trick comes when you put back the top half of the deck. As you do this, move your pinky a bit inward and/or apply inward pressure with it to keep a small break between the chosen card and the top half (doesn't have to be very large). Then all you need to do, is find a way to distract the audience and quickly move the bottom half to the top (make it look like your cutting/shuffling), and you've already recovered the card!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thumb Break</h2>
<p>The thumb break is similar to the one with your pinky. Instead of having your thumb at the side of the deck, you want it at the back. Index and pinky are then on left and right, and middle and ring finger at the side opposite to the thumb. Your hand can be below or above the deck, but below is the more natural grip. Just as with the pinky break, you can use your thumb's flesh to create a break somewhere in the middle of the deck. To get cards from the top, you can do two things:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Let all the other cards of the deck fall into your hand, and have only the remaining one or two cards from the top touching your thumb. This can be done quite smoothly.</li>
	<li>Use your other hand to do a quick<i> </i><em>countback</em>. This means that, if you for example need the top two cards, you place your left hand over the deck and grab a portion of the top cards and quickly drop them again until you feel there's two left between your fingers. You can then pick those cards up, or use your thumb from the right hand to hold the break at the back of the deck.</li>

  title: "[Card Magic] Card Forcing"
  post: "<p>Card forcing is the act of letting the spectator think they are choosing their card at random, but you are forcing your card on them. There are two methods here: sleight of hand ones, and psychological ones. The sleight of hand are basically clever tricks to give the spectator the card that you want, while (s)he thinks it was the one she chose. Psychological ones require you to say and do things in a certain way so that the spectator starts to think of a certain card and eventually picks the one you've been forcing. However, keep in mind that most of these forces are tricky, and you need to be able to perform them smoothly or the trick is immediately done with.</p> 
<h2>Riffle Force</h2>
<p>This one is the simplest to perform, yet is very effective.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Before doing this, quickly spot the bottom card of the deck and memorize it. You're going to force this one.</li>
	<li>Take the deck into your hand, vertically, normal (dealer's) grip</li>
	<li>Then with your other hand, spread out the cards of the deck vertically, so the top cards are closer to you than the bottom card. This allows you to riffle.</li>
	<li>But, what the audience doesn't know, is that you don't move the bottom card, so basically that stays about as close to you as the top card. Or, you could use the thumb from your other hand to glide it back.</li>
	<li>Then, as you riffle through the deck (with the thumb, top to bottom), you ask a spectator to say stop.</li>
	<li>When he says stop, you take the portion you've riffled through off the top of the deck AND the bottom card you slided backwards. Because you've prepared for it, it's easy and unnoticable to take that bottom card with you.</li>
	<li>Then you quickly square this package up, and reveal the bottom card to be the spectator's chosen card.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple, but with a bit of practice, nobody can see the bottom card is in your hand during the riffle and is included with the package when you're squaring it up. This was the first force I learned, and I stuck with it for a long time because it was so effective.</p>
<h2>Hindu Force</h2>
<p>If performed quickly, this one is just as simple but unnoticable.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Before you start, spot the bottom card of the deck, that's the one you'll force.</li>
	<li>Take the deck between the thumb and middle finger of your right hand, with your hand above the deck (palm facing away from you).</li>
	<li>Then with the thumb and middle finger of the left hand, hand underneath the cards (palm facing you), take a small portion of the deck from the top. Let them fall into your left hand like you would normally hold cards (dealer's grip).</li>
	<li>Repeat this action, transporting a few cards from the right hand to the left every time, until the spectator says 'stop!'</li>
	<li>Then, you show them the bottom card from your right hand. This is still the same, because you've only been moving cards from the top of the deck. However, this is hidden by your left hand, so the audience doesn't suspect anything. And if you do it quickly, it even looks impressive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Double Flip Force</h2>
<p>The double flip force may seem somewhat strange to your audience, but works everytime. If you just talk smoothly while doing it, it should be alright.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Spot the top card, that's the one you'll force.</li>
	<li>Hold the deck vertically in your right hand, thumb on top, and the other fingers supporting the bottom.</li>
	<li>Then use your left hand's thumb to riffle through the side of the deck from top to bottom.</li>
	<li>When the spectator says 'stop!' you turn the top portion you've gone through so far upside down (face up).</li>
	<li>Then you continue riffling with the cards underneath the portion you just turned around.</li>
	<li>When the spectator says 'stop!' you again turn around everything above the left thumb and take that portion off of the deck.</li>
	<li>Now you have a group of cards with the first half of them facing up, and the rest facing down. Go through the face-up cards until you meet the first face-down card. That's the one you pick, and give to the spectator.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cross-Cut/False Cut Force</h2>
<p>The false cut force depends more on how well you can present your tricks than real sleight of hand. What you basically do, is cut the deck and mark a certain location as the chosen card, while in fact it's just the top card of the deck you've memorized.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Show the audience it's a normal deck, while at the same time spotting the top card.</li>
	<li>Then go through the deck in any way you like. Perhaps let the spectator cut the deck in two, as long as you have two halves in your hands after this move.</li>
	<li>Then, place the half with the card you memorized on the table. Now place the other half on it, but perpendicular to it, to 'mark' the card the spectator chose.</li>
	<li>Now, you need to cover up that you actually just marked the top card by some smooth talk. 'Okay, you can all confirm that I gave the spectator a regular deck, and he cut it completely at random, and I now marked the card he chose?' It does well, because everything is the truth except for the last statement.</li>
	<li>Then, simply take the top card of the bottom half, which previously was the top card of the deck, and give it to your spectator.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Glide Force</h2>
<p>The glide force only requires you to be smooth with the <em>glide</em>, the rest is easy yet very convincing.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Spot the bottom card of the deck.</li>
	<li>Hold the deck in dealer's grip, face down.</li>
	<li>Ask the spectator to think of any number between 1 and 52. However, to make things a bit easier and faster, you can narrow it down to say 1 up to and including 15.</li>
	<li>While he's thinking, subtly glide the lower card a bit back.</li>
	<li>Now the spectator has said a number, e.g. 10.</li>
	<li>Then you tell them you're going to take 10 cards from the bottom of the deck, and the tenth card will be theirs.</li>
	<li>The first 9 cards you pick though, are actually the second to bottom card. Because you did a glide on the bottom card, it's easier to pick the second to bottom card and make it appear to be the bottom one.</li>
	<li>Then, for the last card, you pick the actual bottom card. Do this as quickly and swiftly as with the others, to not raise suspicion. Put it down on the cards you previously laid on the table, and then raise it and show/give it to the spectator. If you give it to the spectator directly from your hand, they'll be focused on your hand, and might spot the difference.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Elimination Force</h2>
<p>This one depends a lot on quick thinking and your showman skills. It's used more often than you think, in a lot of different ways, but it's also easy to get caught on. I'll try to show you a very abstract way to do it</p>
<ul>
	<li>Say you have 6 groups of cards laying on the table, face down. You know that the spectator's card is on top of the 2nd group.</li>
	<li>Now you ask the spectator to select one group.</li>
	<li>If it's the correct group, simply say 'alright, let's magically turn the top card into your card!' You do some magical movements, and turn the top card over and reveal the spectator's card.</li>
	<li>If it's not the correct one, say 'alright, let's remove this one from the equation! So, select another one' (or something like that). And repeat.</li>
	<li>The reason it works is because people don't know what is done with the selected group. They just select one, and for all they know you're going to eat those cards.</li>
	<li>The reason it's tricky, is because if the audience first picks two wrong groups and then the correct one, how do you explain you now suddenly don't remove the group? Therefore, often either a small number of groups is chosen or an explanation is already thought of, just say something like 'this is the third one you've chosen, and third time is the charm, so let's make it appear on this one!'</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gravity/Cull Force</h2>
<p>This one requires a little more skill than the others, but looks much more like the normal way of letting someone choose a card. You slightly fan the cards, going through them until a spectator says stop. Then you show them the card, but you've actually forced the bottom card.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Spot the bottom card.</li>
	<li>Take the deck in your right hand. Let it lie on your palm, with thumb on the right and the rest of the fingers on the left.</li>
	<li>Now, with the left hand, take the top AND bottom card and slide them a bit to the left and towards you (to conceil the bottom card).</li>
	<li>At the same time, turn the deck over so it's bottom now lies on the fingers of your right hand. Your right thumb should be able to go through the cards, and your left thumb should be able to catch them.</li>
	<li>Perform this motion, quite quickly, until someone says 'stop!'. You shouldn't do it too slow, because then you'll still be somewhere around the top of the deck, and the bottom card becomes too obvious.</li>
	<li>Now, take out the portion you've just gone through + the bottom card, in one swift motion. Square it up to conceil the secret even more, and then simply show the spectator the bottom card of those cards, and give it to him to inspect it (always takes the attention off of what you're actually doing).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dribble Force</h2>
<p>This one is the hardest of them all to do, but again looks more natural and convincing. What you do is <em>dribble</em> through the deck, until someone tells you to stop, and then you show them the card you've stopped at, which is exactly the card yu wanted them to pick. <em>Dribbling</em> through a deck of cards, means slowly dropping cards from your left hand down into your right hand. Like letting cards fall into your right hand, but in a more controlled way.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Get a thumb break with your left hand somewhere around the middle of the deck.</li>
	<li>While you're still talking, spot the card you've cut at by subtly rotating the deck so it faces towards you.</li>
	<li>Now, dribble the cards from left to right. Keep your hands close together to not reveal too much (and make no mistakes), and let one or two cards fall at a time, at a constant rate. If you let a big chunk of cards fall every other second, it doesn't look as good and the force is easily noticed.</li>
	<li>When the spectator <em>starts saying</em> 'stop!', there's two possibilities:
1) You've already gone past your thumb break, so an almost complete deck already lies in your right hand.
2) Or you haven't reached that point yet.</li>
	<li>In case 1, simply drop all the cards remaining and tell him he was too late and start again.</li>
	<li>In case 2, now drop all the cards remaining until the thumb break. Then get the bottom card of the cards remaining in your left hand, which you've spotted earlier on, and show/give it to the spectator</li>
</ul>
<p>The difficult part here is to learn to dribble nicely, the rest shouldn't be too hard.</p>"

  title: "[Card Magic] Card Hiding"
  post: "<p>Hiding a card is very useful. There are multiple ways which you can use to make it seem like a card has disappeared or switched places, while in fact it hasn't. While your audience is already baffled because of the disappeared card, you can bring it back easily because you've been (for example) holding it in your other hand all the time.</p> 
<h2>Double Lift</h2>
<p>A double lift is used <em>very very often</em>, and takes some practice to nail it down. However, if you can eventually perform the double lift, a whole world of tricks opens up for you!</p>

<p>So, a double lift basically means grabbing two cards from a deck, while presenting it as one. This way you can pretend that a certain card is another one, which always comes in handy in magic.</p>
<ul>
	<li>To do a double lift, you first need to have the two cards seperated from the rest of the deck. To just lift two cards from a deck like you'd do with one card is very hard.</li>
	<li>So, create a pinky break, a thumb break, or subtly slide two cards off the deck with your thumb. With all methods, make sure you can seperate them quickly, and just as quickly pick up the two cards.</li>
	<li>Now, you need to make sure both cards are squared up, but you want to handle the cards in about the same way you handle single ones. Here's a few options:
<ol>
	<li>The easiest one is to pick up the double with multiple fingers, keeping the cards squared between them. With some training holding it between the thumb and index finger while keeping it squared should be possible. At that moment, you can bend the cards a bit or rotate them to give the audience the feeling you're just playing with a card.</li>
	<li>Another one is more fancy: fetch the card at the bottom left corner, and rotate it around at the base of the thumb. This way you have control over two points (top left and bottom right), which should keep the double squared. Then once you've turned it around you can keep it in your hands and later reverse the motion or drop it again on the deck and just do the whole thing again to turn them upside down.</li>
	<li>Another one that's often seen is where you don't really lift the cards in the air, so there's not much chance the two cards will split. For this, you fetch the card on the side with one or two fingers. Then slide it to the left until the right side of the double almost loses its touch with the deck. Now quickly turn it over and let it fall on the deck. Make sure to make it fall a bit to the side, so you can easily pick it up and turn it around again. If done quickly, this looks very convincing and is I think the method that's mostly used.</li>
	<li>This one also looks fancy, but isn't really much. Lift the double between your thumb and middle finger, letting your index finger put pressure around the center of the cards and bend them a bit. Then, release your thumb and the cards should jump upside down and you now hold them between your middle and index finger. Quickly put them down (and keep a pinky break in the back for turning them face down again).</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>One last tip: make your touch very light. Not only do the cards naturally stay together and putting pressure on them only makes them seperate, it also makes it look like you're handling a single card.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Palm Lift</h2>
<p>The palm lift refers to the action of lifting the top card of a deck into the palm of your hand. Then at some later moment you can return it to the deck or reveal it.</p>
<ul>
	<li>First, make sure the top card is seperated from the rest of the deck. Create a pinky break, slide it a bit sideways with your thumb, whatever you like.</li>
	<li>Then with your free hand, go over the deck and pretend to square it or start shuffling.</li>
	<li>Get the card between the first knuckle of your fingers and the first one of your thumb. Curl your hand a bit while lifting the card up to make bend the card and press it against your palm.</li>
	<li>Make sure your fingers are close together (so the card can't be seen through them) and no corner of the card sticks out.</li>
	<li>Then simply keep your palm out of sight, and direct the attention to somewhere else.</li>
	<li>You can do some fancy moves, and at any moment you can throw the deck into the hand that has the card palmed, and square it up quickly and the card is back on top again!</li>
	<li>Another thing that works well, is splitting the deck in two and grabbing the top half into the hand that has the card palmed. That way the card is also easily returned to the top of the deck.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Cards can sometimes retain their bend a bit when returned to the deck. Even out the card(s) before any spectator can ask questions!</p>
<h2>Back Palm</h2>
<p>The back palm is a technique that could be a trick on it's own. While holding a card in your palm, you can quickly move it to the back of your hand (making it disappear) and show the audience your hand's empty!</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hold a card in your hand: thumb on one side, middle and ring finger on the other side. It's very important you hold it this way, and it also helps to hold the card at the bottom corner (instead of somewhere around the middle).</li>
	<li>Then, curl your middle and ring finger inwards, but keep the card in position, so now that card is between your thumb and the first knuckles of your middle+ring finger.</li>
	<li>Then, use your index finger and pinky (also curl them inwards) to get a hold of the top and bottom corner respectively. So now, you have the bottom corner of the card between your pinky and ring finger, and the top corner between the middle and index finger.</li>
	<li>Now simply, while keeping a good hold on the card's corners, curl your fingers back into their initial position. The cards is now at the back of your hand, only held by its corners.</li>

  title: "[Card Magic] Card Revealing!"
  post: "<p>Once you've got a spectator's card into a nice position, or you know which one it is, you can reveal it. However, simply grabbing the card and showing it doesn't feel very magic, so you can use some nice revealing methods.</p>

<p>If you know someone's card (through a force, spotting the bottom card, whatever), you can do three things:</p> 
<ol>
	<li>Simply turn over the deck and search the deck for the card. This is of course very simple, but is okay if you make it look cooler with some fancy movements and talking.</li>
	<li>Pretend to be a psychic ('I see a five...no, looks like it, it's a nine! And black, it's black..it looks like hearts, but it's black, so it must be clubs! The nine of clubs!')</li>
	<li>Do a <i>Check your Pocket</i> (see below)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have someone's card at the top, you can do a <em>Snap Change</em> or <em>Magic Finger</em>.</p>

<p>If the card is at the bottom, you can do a <em>Slap the Deck </em> or <em>Say a Number</em>.</p>
<h2>Check your Pocket</h2>
<p>This one requires some work to set it up, but is of course the most impressive reveal.  You pick a certain card, we'll use the 2 of clubs.</p>

<p>Before the show/trick starts, you hide a 2 of clubs from another deck somewhere (in a spectator's pocket, in the box, glued to the ceiling, whatever you think is cool).</p>

<p>Then, you simply force the 2 of clubs on a spectator. You let him put it into the deck, randomly. Then you need to make it disappear from the deck. You can palm the card, perform a double lift, or put all the cards back into the box (do some magical movements), and then take out the complete deck except for the 2 of clubs.</p>

<p>You then ask the spectator to go through the deck and confirm the card has indeed vanished. Then you tell them 'well, why don't you check your pocket?'</p>
<h2>Snap Change</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Do a double lift so you have two cards in your hand: a random card and behind that the spectator's card.</li>
	<li>Then, take the double between your middle+index finger and thumb. Keep it horizontally, face towards your audience.</li>
	<li>Release pressure from the index finger, and use your middle finger to slide the front card downwards and backwards.</li>
	<li>When you're done, you should have the spectator's card between your index finger and thumb, and the other card behind that held by your middle finger and thumb.</li>
	<li>Do this quickly, and snap with your other hand to make it look even more awesome.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Magic Finger</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Hold the deck in your left hand, between your thumb and middle finger. Hold it vertically, facing the audience, and keep the index finger for support on that side.</li>
	<li>Then, you tap on the deck with your right hand's index finger a few times before raising a card out of it as if it was magic! How's this done?</li>
	<li>Well, the last time you tap with the index finger you extend the pinky of that hand, and press it against the top card of the deck. You shouldn't put very much pressure on it. Then slowly move your hand up.</li>
	<li>Keep in mind though, that at a certain point the card will start to rotate. Just before that, stop making it rise, and simply grab it and show it to the audience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Say a Number</h2>
<p>This one is just like the glide force, but then as a reveal.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ask the spectator to say a number between 1-52 (you can make it 5-15 if you want, or anything else you think suits the trick best)</li>
	<li>While he thinks, glide back the bottom card (which is the spectator's card, and you know that).</li>
	<li>Then, let's say he says 10.</li>
	<li>You take the second to bottom card from the deck the first 9 times.</li>
	<li>And for the last time, you take the actual bottom card, and show it to the audience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slap the Deck</h2>
<p>This requires some training to get the impact of the slap right, but if you can do that you can even put the cards into the hands of the spectator to make this reveal even more impressive.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Take the deck between the knuckles of the middle and index finger. Though I recommend you somehow split the deck or take a smaller portion, because a complete deck for this reveal is a bit of an overkill.</li>
	<li>Then, simply slap the deck a few times, making sure you don't slap it too hard (or too softly), and move your slapping hand away from the other hand while you do it.</li>
	<li>This should release all cards, and make them fly in all directions - except for the bottom card!</li>
	<li><em>Why does this work? </em> The slap makes cards from the top of the deck slide off of it. You naturally want to keep a hold of the cards, so the best thing you can do after a few slaps is keep the bottom card in your hand. This is such a natural movement, it works every time.</li>

  title: "How to Sing"
  post: "<p>Welcome to the guide to proper vocal technique. Whether you just want to strengthen your voice, be able to hum with your favourite tunes, sing in a casual band or become a rockstar---good vocal technique is always an useful skill to carry with you. Not only does it make your singing voice sound better and cleaner, it also helps with making your speaking voice stronger and easier to understand.  Because singing doesn't require any extra tools or special circumstances, you can do it whenever and wherever you want, which basically makes it an extra tool to keep yourself entertained (and perhaps others) that you're always carrying with you!</p>

<h2>What this guide does not do</h2>

<p>There are large groups of people on the internet who claim to teach you tricks that will make you a singing success overnight. That's not going to happen. Singing is a very complex collaboration between all sorts of muscles around your mouth. Muscles need repetition and exercise to grow stronger and to remember certain movements and positions.</p>

<p>Of course, there are exercises you can use and techniques you can try to implement that will make your voice immediately sound better, but that is only temporary---you don't want to spend the rest of your life thinking of all those tips &amp; tricks while singing, hoping they won't fail you this time. You want to be sure of what you can and can't do, and you want to be able to always sound the same.</p>

<p>Also, many people say singing is like a sport. While it is true that your stamina needs to be very good, and you need to be in reasonably good shape, it is not necessary to put all your muscle power into singing. Singing should only ever make your abs tired. Nevertheless, if you've been singing for a solid hour (or two) it is best to take a rest because if stressed long enough, your vocal chords will tire and your lungs will have reached their top capacity.</p>

<h2>What this guide does teach you</h2>

<p>This guide will teach you the basic principles of singing and good vocal technique. Then I'll give you some exercises that are also used by professional singers, that make sure you don't hurt your voice when singing. To finish it off I'll talk a bit about singing low notes, high notes, and different voice types, ranges and breaks.</p>

<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>

<p>Never, ever, damage your voice. When you feel it is tiring or breaking, stop. Give it a rest, drink plenty of water, return the next day.</p>

<p>When you feel something is tense, do some stretching, try to let it go, and if that doesn't help---give it a rest. Don't force anything, don't think that if you just try and push hard enough you'll get there. Your voice needs to grow and strengthen, your body needs to adapt to new vocal techniques, it takes time.</p>

  title: "[Singing] Fundamentals of Singing"
  post: "<p>Singing is a wonderful thing. It could basically be called elegant exhaling. All you have to do is position your mouth, tongue and vocal box correctly and beautiful sounds will leave your body.</p> 

<p>Sounds simple, but the fact is that most people have over the years, as they grow up, stopped using the proper techniques to create sounds. When you were a baby, you could scream very loudly for hours on end, without your vocal chords tiring (which is quite annoying actually). When you were a toddler, you were always screaming and yelling and talking fast, loud and at high pitch, and still you never felt a sore throat. However, as you grow older, your voice changes (boys more dramatically than girls, but still), and you somehow lose that ability. Now I'm not saying screaming or yelling is any good for the voice, but having a higher, clear and moderately loud voice is always better than having a soft, muddy, unclear, grungy one. It just improves your life, your image, so much.</p>

<p>(By the way, there are lots of rock singers who do vocal exercises before shows, so that they can scream all they want without hurting their voice (very much). Screaming is never good, but good vocal technique can even help minimize the stress if you are that wild, so there's really no reason to be ashamed of doing vocal exercises!)</p>

<h2>How does Singing Work?</h2>

<p>Simply put, singing is making the air you exhale sound exactly how you want. You're modifying the air you exhale, so that they become sound waves at certain frequencies, which then again are interpreted as (beautiful) sounds. So, which components are involved in the process?</p>

<img src="media/MouthAnatomySinging.png" />

<ul>
	<li><strong>Vocal chords:</strong> Obviously, your vocal chords are the first thing that comes to mind. It's a group of two muscles, one left and one right, which work together to create sounds. When you simply breathe, they are far apart and they let the air fly through without obstruction. When you sing, they are pushed together to create pressured air waves (some parts are pressed together, some are stretched), which is the definition of sound. They can also be stretched out to create higher pitches.</li>
	<li><strong>Vocal box/voice box (larynx):</strong> The part of your neck your vocal chords are in. It's called like this because it has the shape of a box, and can actually move up and down the neck. Men can easily spot it, as it's exactly where the Adam's apple is located.</li>
	<li><strong>Jaw:</strong> I'd be tempted to say <em>mouth</em> here, but that would also include some other parts that have different functions, so I like to keep them separated. Lowering your jaw allows sound to come out of your mouth. Leaving it closed forces the air to move out through your nose, which honestly doesn't sound very well.</li>
	<li><strong>Tongue:</strong> Your tongue is responsible for creating vowels and consonants. Singing can only be done on vowels, which means that your tongue needs to be able to shift quickly between different sounds when singing.</li>
	<li><strong>Swallow Muscles:</strong> Those are located just below your jaw---basically on the bridge between your neck and your head. If you feel tension when singing, it is most likely to come from your swallow muscles engaging (too much).</li>
	<li><strong>Soft palate:</strong> The what now?! This is just a crucial spot on the roof of your mouth, around the back. At the front it is called the <em>hard palate</em>. This part also plays a role in eating/swallowing, which means that you need to get this out of the way as well.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>That seems difficult.</h2>

<p>I do agree, that this might be much to take in, let alone trying to control all of these at once when singing. Therefore, I recommend not trying to improve them all at once. Vocal exercises work a bit on all of them, so those are always good to do often. But, for example, desperately trying to force your jaw down while singing is not a good idea, just as it isn't wise to try to keep your tongue out of the way and at the same time trying to keep your soft palate up. Improve one thing until it can be done without tension and without thinking about it, then move on.</p>

<h2>Some extra info on Vocal Chords</h2>

<p>As seen that your vocal chords are the vital part of singing, extra attention needs to be paid to them.</p>

<p>Your vocal chords work by using small muscles around it to push them together, and to stretch and shorten them. This means that there are no other muscles in your neck, shoulders or face needed to make them work! Low notes and high notes of course require different muscle tension, but that should be controlled by those small muscles only.</p>

<p>The lowest note you can sing is determined by the minimum length of your vocal chords. That means, the length they have when not influenced by any muscles at all, when not stretched. This means that damaging your vocal chords, will create scars and weak spots on them, which in turn shortens them and lowers your voice. Therefore, you can't train to sing lower than you can, but you can train to make your lowest notes sound the best they can</p>

<p>The highest note you can sing is determined by the maximum length of your vocal chords. Stretching them more creates a higher note. And just as with muscles in your arms or legs: regularly stretching them and working out is the only way to get a bigger vocal range. But do know that there is a limit, and that you will need to switch to falsetto and not desperately try to push higher in your regular voice.</p>

  title: "[Singing] Good Vocal Technique"
  post: "<p>Now, that's a thing to strive for! But before you start applying all sorts of tips and tricks at once, you need to know the path that is best to follow.</p>

<h2>The 3 major vocal ranges</h2>

<p>When talking about singing ranges, we often identify three different ones:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Low:</strong> Your low notes. They are lower than your speaking voice. Most often, there are far less low notes you can (comfortably) sing below your speaking voice, then there are high ones above it.</li>
	<li><strong>Mid:</strong> Your regular, middle range notes. They are around the pitch of your speaking voice. They are identified as being easy, painless and comfortable for you to sing, at any time.</li>
	<li><strong>High:</strong> Your high notes. This is everything from where it starts to feel outside of your comfort zone until you hit the highest pitch you can possibly get.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've used a lot of positive words on the <strong>midrange</strong>, and for a reason. You should first master this range. Being able to sing all notes here gives you a good basic range to work from, and eliminates any tension or other problems with your speaking voice (so you don't hurt yourself when speaking).</p>

<p>After you've done that, I'd actually recommend starting with the <strong>low notes</strong>. Although you can also start with mastering <strong>high notes</strong>, I have found starting low the best way. First of all, because trying to blast through low notes usually hurts your voice in a different, more negative way. It lowers your voice, until the point where those low notes become your midrange. Second of all, because they are easier to master, as they usually lie closer to your comfortable range and there's a lower tendency to create lots of tension.</p>

<h2>Optimal positions for every part involved</h2>

<p>In the previous chapter we've discussed all parts involved in singing. Here I'll give you the optimal position for them, which means that if they are in that position, and you're still experiencing tension or vocal cracks, it's got nothing to do with that part.</p>

<img src="media/MouthPerfectPositionsSinging.png" />

<ul>
	<li><strong>Vocal chords:</strong> Their position is determined by their container, the larynx.</li>
	<li><strong>Vocal box/voice box (larynx):</strong> This should be in the same position as it is when you're relaxed and just breathing in and out. This is usually a bit below the top of the neck. When singing high notes, it tends to move upwards. When singing low notes, it tends to move down. Keep it in roughly the same spot, always.</li>
	<li><strong>Jaw:</strong> Down and open. If you have a small mouth, a tendency to close your mouth or just a habit of speaking with only a narrow opening you might need to exaggerate this movement a bit. This doesn't mean forcing it down---this means letting it drop as far as it can. It's perfectly possible to sing with an only slightly lowered jaw, but opening it creates more volume, more resonance and forces some other parts to stay in place.</li>
	<li><strong>Tongue:</strong> As mentioned earlier, your tongue should be out of the way on vowels. This means that when singing vowels or any note that isn't extremely short, your tongue should be down and touching the back of your lower teeth. When singing consonants, your tongue should just be in the regular place for that consonant (which is usually a bit higher or even touching the upper teeth). However, you may need to exaggerate the consonants and vowels a bit to keep them distinct and not let the tongue make a mess of it and blur the sound.</li>
	<li><strong>Swallow Muscles:</strong> They should not be tensed up or engaged, but should be in their regular spot. Eating before or while singing is therefore never a good idea, and vocal exercises before singing should help relax them.</li>
	<li><strong>Soft palate:</strong> This should be <strong>raised</strong>. You might think that you don't really feel the difference, or don't know when it is up or down, but with practice you'll feel what I mean. When it is down, you'll notice that when you sing the sound feels like it resonates in your mouth. You feel tension, the sound is flat, muddy or hoarse, not what you want. When it is up, you feel the sound travel up and like it is resonating between your eyes/in your head. Lowering your jaw usually opens it up a bit, but a good tongue position is most decisive in the matter.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>Breathing properly---adding support</h2>

<p>One thing I have not mentioned is your lungs. Why? Because if you're alive, it means they are working and you have nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>But, because all sound starts with breathing or 'pushing air out', they also have their own preferred settings, so to speak.</p>

<p>When we're talking about this, we usually call it <strong>support</strong>. That is because a good breathing technique supports your sound, while a bad one leaves all the technique to your vocal chords.</p>

<p>We'll talk about this more in another chapter, but the key things to look out for now are these:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Maintain good posture: </strong>This means standing (or sitting) up straight, with a straight back, shoulders back, your neck straight up, and your face perfectly horizontal and looking straight forward. This is optimal for air flow, and also for singing in general.</li>
	<li><strong>Abdominal breathing:</strong> There are two ways to breathe, and one of them is actually very wrong but used by everyone and everywhere. This may seem strange,  but we do it without noticing it, when we're stressed, tired, whatever.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><strong>Chest breathing</strong>: The wrong one. When inhaling, your shoulders lift a bit and the top of your chest may expand a bit. Your using all of your facial, neck and shoulder muscles to breathe in and out, and the air never fully reaches the rest of your body.</li>
		<li><strong>Abdominal breathing:</strong> The right one. When inhaling, you should feel no pressure at all in the upper are of your body, and you should feel your belly expand a bit outward. It should feel like the air drops right to the bottom of your longs when inhaling. You use your abs to control this type of air flow (hence the name), and that is also the only area that you should feel some pressure in. Or rather you should feel that there is something happening only there.</li>
	</ul>

  title: "[Singing] The Mask"
  post: "<p>It sounds like some sort of superhero or supervillain, but I have to disappoint you. The mask is something that is used when teaching about <strong>vocal placement</strong>. The mask basically refers to the area you should <em>place</em> your sound, which means you should feel the sound resonate there.</p> 

<p>A good vocal placement not only makes your sound fuller, louder and clearer---it also makes the difference between hurting yourself and not getting any kind of normal sound, and singing freely.</p>

<h2>Where is it?</h2>

<p>The mask is exactly where the name suggests:  at the front of your face, the area around your eyes.</p>

<p>But, you must realize that the eyes are placed more to the back of the head than your mouth or nose. It is important to place your sound forward, but you shouldn't mistake it for placing the sound near your nose (as this creates a nasal, country-like tone). On the other hand, placing the sound all the way in the back of your throat is also not exactly preferred.</p>

<h2>Balance</h2>

<p>As you see, it is kinda tricky to get the placement right, but you'll know it when you have it. It just feels free, relaxed and strong. You should feel the sound resonate around the mask area, and nowhere else.</p>

<h2>How do I get the sound there?</h2>

<p>Practice, exercises and good vocal technique will in the long run get the sound more towards the spot.</p>

<p>But, there are tricks that help some people out. Not all of them, and you should not use them if they create too much tension:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Weirdly enough, some people can just put the sound there. You can just imagine the sound being pushed into that area, a bit up and a bit forward. Then you can just push the sound a bit towards that spot. I don't really recommend it, but it works for some.</li>
	<li><strong>Singing to the top of your head:</strong> Put a hand on your head (or not, if you think that looks too embarrassing). Now try to sing to your hand/the top of your head, without forcing it. Just try to let the air go more towards the top of your head, and you should feel it resonate more and your soft palate should lift. Once you get the right feeling, you know what it feels like and can use it to determine when your placement is wrong and when it is right.</li>
	<li><strong>Singing falsetto:</strong> Singing in a light falsetto that is comfortable for most people requires the sound to be in the mask area.</li>

  title: "[Singing] Breathing Exercises"
  post: "<p>People who sport quite often usually already know how to do this, but for some people this is very strange. These breathing exercises will let you use the <em>abdominal breathing technique</em> discussed a few chapters ago, and it allows you to control your breath more. When you've just exercised, you just woke up, or you've eaten recently, your breathing is usually a bit off and not ready for singing. Breathing exercises will also help with getting the air flow on the right track before starting to sing.</p> 

<h2>Abdominal Breathing Technique</h2>

<p>If you're having trouble trying to breathe only by expanding and contracting your belly, or engaging and releasing your abs, it usually helps to do this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Lie on your back, make sure you're comfortable.</li>
	<li>Put a book, or something moderately heavy on your abdomen.</li>
	<li>Now try to move the book up and down with only your abdomen.</li>
	<li>If you manage to get it to move up and down regularly with simply breathing, you're on the right track.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>Controlled Air Flow</h2>

<p>This one's for extending how much air you can use ( = how long you can hold a note), and for 'resetting' the air flow.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Quickly inhale as much as you can. Try to do this properly and not create any tension anywhere.</li>
	<li>Put your teeth together, push your tongue against them, and create a simple snake-like '<strong>sssssss'</strong> sound.</li>
	<li>Do it as loud as you can, and try to keep the note for as long as you can.</li>
	<li>Repeat a few times until you can do this for a relatively long time, and in a relaxed manner.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>Tips to keep in mind</h2>

<p>You should feel the air drop lower, even below your belly button. Visualizing the air to be heavy can sometimes help. The only tension should be in your abs, and even that should not be too extreme. Remember that singing is a relaxing activity, and adding good support should only add to that smoothness.</p>

  title: "[Singing] Vocal Exercises"
  post: "<p>This topic's importance cannot be overestimated. If you're experiencing any kind of vocal problems, I'd go as far as to say this is the most important part. Vocal exercises are basically activities you can do that engage your vocal chords and everything else just as usually would happen, but do so in a way that doesn't hurt you. They can only be done (properly) if your technique is perfect and everything is in their optimal position. This might seem very hard, but these exercises were designed to make it easy for you to do exactly that.</p> 

<p>Repeating them every day, for at least 15 minutes, not only improves your technique, but also strengthens your voice and makes sure it is not damaged (much).</p>

<h2>Vocal Damage</h2>

<p>When I talk about damage, I mean anything that is not normal or healthy for your vocal chords. They are muscles, and their boundaries should be respected. They are very small and flexible, yet used all day every day. Therefore, if you damage them in any way, you <em>really</em> need to take a rest to let it heal or it will become permanent. This sounds like an easy thing to do, but it isn't. You should really tell yourself to stop and take a break whenever you're forcing too much or feeling something happening in your throat.</p>

<p>The bad news is though, that damage can also be done by things other than bad vocal technique or too much pressure. Some types of foods (such as dairy products) create <em>mucus</em>, which hinders your vocal tone. When you wake up, your voice/mouth has usually done some resting and growing and has thrown out any waste from that process. Both of these contribute to a rasp or uncontrollable vocal chords, due to the fact there's actual stuff in your throat obstructing the air flow</p>

<p>The good news is that this can be solved if you're careful. Any extra stuff you get from eating can be resolved by drinking water and swallowing. When you wake up, you should <em>always</em> do vocal exercises to remove anything that could damage your voice.</p>

<p>Of course, there are factors outside of these two that play a huge role, such as smoking, drinking alcohol, vocal abuse by coughing and screaming all the time. If you want a good singing voice, abandon all of these, please. A rough voice may sound sexy, but only for the 5 or 10 years that it may last.</p>

<h2>The Lip-Roll</h2>

<p>This is perhaps the most famous and most effective of vocal exercises. I therefore recommend to always start with this one, and perfect the technique on this one before moving on to anything else. The idea is that singing the way I'll describe makes it much easier to shift between pitches and to sing over any difficult notes. Therefore, using this technique you can sing notes you can't normally (so you can strengthen them without forcing it), and it relaxes the face.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Keep your mouth closed (don't force it, just your normal mouth shut).</li>
	<li>Create a <strong>'brrrrr'</strong> sound with your lips.</li>
	<li>While doing that, sing any note.</li>
	<li>You shouldn't feel any tension in your mouth, and you shouldn't push too much air to make your lips roll. Instead, you should have a light feeling above those brr-ing lips, around the nose and eyes.</li>
	<li>Once you're comfortable with a few notes in your midrange, you can try going up and down, and even moving into falsetto and back should be easy with a bit of practice.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>Humming</h2>

<p>Some people can naturally hum very well, some people have lots of trouble with it. The thing is, humming is another way of creating sounds without opening your mouth, but it is more natural and normal than the lip-roll. It is therefore a bit harder to do, but you need perfect vocal technique to hum all notes of your range, so this is by far the best way to get there. It removes most tongue and all jaw movement (because you're not singing different vowels/consonants), so you can really focus on the rest.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Keep your mouth closed, tongue down.</li>
	<li>Create a simple 'hmm' or 'mmm' sound. Like when you want to say yes or indeed, but your mouth is full because you're eating, and say 'mm-mm' instead.</li>
	<li>You should again feel the sound resonate around the area of your eyes. If you feel it resonate in your mouth/too low, you're not humming correctly and doing the exercise that way will not bring you any good.</li>

  title: "[Singing] Middle (Speaking) Range"
  post: "<p>This should be the first thing you try and perfect. If you can't get this right, there's no use in putting your training into low and/or high notes, because you can't really reach them or connect them.</p> 

<p>Singing notes in this range, means singing notes that are comfortable and around the pitch of your speaking voice. You should not feel much tension, and your larynx shouldn't rise.</p>

<p>But, there might still be a lot wrong with your technique (think of placement or your tongue being in the way). Therefore, it's best to try to get this range of maybe 5 or 6 notes perfect.</p>

<h2>What to Do</h2>

<p>Vocal exercises inside this range should help a lot, and you should always start with them.</p>

<p>Besides that, pay attention to your speaking voice and make sure that isn't hurting you. Of course, speaking and singing is different and should not sound or work exactly the same, but you should at least be able to get a clear, moderately loud, understandable tone out of your mouth as you speak.</p>

<p>Last but not least, when you feel confident you can try singing songs with a small vocal range, here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>100 Suns</strong> by <strong>30 Seconds to Mars</strong> (less than an octave)</li>
	<li><strong>Into my Arms</strong> by <strong>Nick Cave</strong> (less than an octave)</li>
	<li><strong>These Boots are Made for Walking</strong> by <strong>Nancy Sinatra</strong> (exactly one octave)</li>
	<li><strong>Sweet Dreams</strong> by <strong>Eurythmics</strong> (exactly one octave)</li>
	<li><strong>Here Comes the Rain Again</strong> by <strong>Eurythmics</strong> (exactly one octave)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Why do I give songs with one octave vocal range?</em> Because you can transpose these songs, down or up to your comfortable midrange level, and from there on sing through the whole sing without having to strain or hit difficult notes.</p>

  title: "[Singing] Low Notes"
  post: "<p>Low notes are usually forgotten or just plain ignored when learning vocal technique. I think that is very wrong, as seen that low notes also matter a lot, and well sung low notes sound beautiful. On the other hand, not being able to sing a healthy low note will seriously damage your vocal capabilities.</p> 

<h2>What to Do</h2>

<p>Vocal exercises, start from your lowest note and move to the top.</p>

<p>Also, we tend to look downwards and drop our larynx (too much) when singing low notes. Try to keep your face straight up, and your larynx at the same place. If that is difficult for you, it helps to imagine the sound traveling/resonating more into the top of your head, or to <em>sing upwards</em> as you could call it. Usually the problem with low notes is in the fact that people place the sound too much in their mouth, and drop everything too much, which makes it all loose and uncontrollable.</p>

<p>Thirdly, low notes require <strong>more air</strong> than higher ones. That doesn't mean you should blast everything you have into it, it just means that you should learn to take deeper breaths and support the note with more air <em>if</em> you are having problems with support.</p>

<p>If you feel confident, you can start singing songs. You could transpose any existing song so that its lowest note matches your lowest note. If you don't feel like doing that, you could search for songs that include (lots of) low notes in their verses.</p>

<p>Don't try to sing very high yet, focus on singing the low and midrange perfectly.</p>

  title: "[Singing] High Notes"
  post: "<p>Now that you have a solid range of presumably more than one octave, it is time for you to get the high notes right and increase your range. High notes are usually more preferred in pop and rock songs than low ones, and people often label a singer as good or bad depending on how well (s)he can hit the high notes. While I don't really agree with that, it is true that a bigger vocal range creates more possibilities and more varied songs. And it can really demonstrate your vocal abilities.</p> 

<h2>What to Do</h2>

<p>Vocal exercises. Start from your lowest note and move to the top. Then start at the top and move to the lowest note. Usually, moving upwards is harder than going down, but you should be able to do both.</p>

<p>Also, we tend to look upwards and raise our larynx (too much) when singing high notes. Try to keep your face straight up, and your larynx at the same place. If that is difficult for you, it helps to imagine the sound traveling a little more downwards, or<em> singing downwards</em>. Make sure though that your vocal placement is still right.</p>

<p>Opening your jaw a bit more also helps with opening up the mouth and creating room for the higher notes. Don't stress it too much though.</p>

<p>And last but not least, usually singers start to increase their volume and push more breath when singing high notes. While it helps most people to sing higher notes with lots of power, there's actually <strong>less air</strong> needed to sing them. Therefore, if you want to sing powerful and punchy high notes, you need to contract your abs to control the air flow. If you just want high notes, you shouldn't blast that much air.</p>

<p><em>What about falsetto?</em> While falsetto is the highest you can go, much higher than your regular voice in most cases, I am going to discuss that in a later chapter. But, it follows these same rules to a certain extent, so practicing with falsetto is also a great idea.</p>

<p>And if you're confident, you can start singing songs. Most songs include some high notes at least (in the chorus and bridge), but you could try singing songs that have high notes all the time if you think you can do it. If you can't however, you shouldn't, and you should keep practicing until you can.</p>

  title: "[Singing] Voice Types, Ranges & Breaks"
  post: "<p>This chapter I will not give you any more exercises or techniques, but I will explain a bit about what a voice can and can't do, what people usually struggle with and the different voice ranges. These tips will help you determine what type of voice you have so you can find songs that perfectly match that range, but it might also answer some leftover questions you have about your voice or singing in general</p> 

<h2>Voice Types</h2>

<p>While I sometimes use these interchangeably with voice ranges, I will try to make the distinction clear here. With voice types I mean the different bits of your voice that you can use at certain ranges:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Chest Voice:</strong> Your regular voice. Encompasses your speaking range and the bits below that. It sounds clear and strong.</li>
	<li><strong>Mixed Voice: </strong>The part between the chest voice and head voice. It contains semi-high notes for you. By that I mean that it is the range of notes that are just above your speaking zone, which usually sound a bit different. They are usually a bit louder and have less of a resonance or vibrato to them. With good vocal technique you solve these problems.</li>
	<li><strong>Head Voice:</strong> The part that contains your highest notes (that are not falsetto). These notes are usually a bit louder, clear, strong and feel fuller and more substantial than falsetto. It is basically the high chest voice, but not <em>exactly</em> the same.</li>
	<li><strong>Falsetto: </strong>Your highest notes. It is a different kind of singing, as your vocal chords are not exactly connected but only touch lightly. It is therefore a bit harder to control, and it should be seen differently. Most people know how it sounds or can switch to some falsetto notes---boys switch to it all the time when their voice changes during puberty. But because the technique is different, you should look at your falsetto as a range on its own: your lowest falsetto notes should have the same technique and feeling as low notes (even though they are much higher, because they are falsetto). Falsetto is trained best by going through all of the notes you can hit with <strong>lip-rolls</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>Voice Ranges</h2>

<p>Everybody is born with a different set of vocal chords, which means everybody can (naturally) sing in a different range. While you can extend your range with more higher notes, your lowest note can't be altered, and there's always a limit to how far you can stretch your range. These voice ranges are available:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Bass: </strong>E2---E4</li>
	<li><strong>Baritone: </strong>G2---G4</li>
	<li><strong>Tenor: </strong>C3---C5</li>
	<li><strong>Alto: </strong>G3---G5</li>
	<li><strong>Mezzo-soprano: </strong>A3---A5</li>
	<li><strong>Soprano: </strong>C4---C6</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>What do these letters and numbers mean?</em></strong> The letter specifies the note, and the number the octave. Usually, C3 or C4 is called <strong>middle C</strong>, because it is the note in the center of a piano, and the center of the vocal ranges. While this list assumes a vocal range of two octaves, it's more common to have 1 or 1.5 max if you're not a trained singer, and 2.5 to 3 max if you're a trained singer.</p>

<p>Most men are born with a baritone range, while women are born with the mezzo-soprano.</p>

<p>This again leads to the question <strong><em>are these the only ranges? </em></strong>No, for example, most pop and rock singers have an extended range and are <strong>Low Tenors</strong> or <strong>High Tenors</strong>.</p>

<p>If you can indicate your range, you can find songs that fit. It also helps when auditioning for a musical (or even opera), as they usually need to know your voice range to see which part(s) you can play.</p>

<h2>Breaks (passagios)</h2>

<p>I've discussed the several parts of the voice, but that doesn't mean they just magically transform into one another on a certain note. There are always a few notes that form the bridge between the two worlds, and those are called a <strong>break</strong> or <strong>passagio</strong>. Often times, those are the most difficult notes to sing (even if they're not particularly high or low), because your voice doesn't really know what to do with them and just tries its best. This might result in no sound at all, a weak or broken sound, or the voice constantly shifting between different notes when trying to hold a certain note for a long time.</p>

<p>Breaks are smoothened or <em>ironed out</em> by doing vocal exercises. With those you can sing them easily and in the correct way. You can't immediately use that in actual singing, but with time and patience you'll get used to the right way to sing those notes.</p>

<p>The break that is the hardest to overcome is the one between head voice and falsetto. They are just two completely different ways of singing, and you feel like you need to tense up or replace your whole singing system when switching between them. Again, vocal exercises and scales help a lot, but it also helps to do exercises starting from your highest falsetto note and then going down. Moving downwards gives you a sense of relieving pressure, and if you remember that feeling when moving up in your range, you should see improvement.</p>

  title: "Become a Foosball/Table Soccer Champion"
  post: "<p>Welcome to the guide on how to become better at foosball. Whether you've always wanted to be better than the average random person at this great game, want to impress some people or are eager to join foosball tournaments---this guide is for you.</p> 

<p>I'll start with explaining a bit about the table and the game itself; the rules, setup, playing conventions. Then I will move on to explaining the fundamentals of attacking as well as defending, and finish it off with tips &amp; tricks. I will include the most common shots or techniques with every section, but using the basic rules and possibilities I explain you will be able to perhaps make up your own special trademark shot.</p>

<h2>How to use this guide</h2>

<p>You can use it any way you like, but I think there is a certain order and strategy which will yield the best results.</p>

<p>Usually with a game, I would recommend starting with defending and then moving on to attacking. With table soccer however, how you defend really depends on your knowledge of the attacking skills of your opponents and attacking in general.</p>

<p>On top of that, foosball is a wild game. Especially if not everyone knows what they're doing, people can start just shooting the ball randomly and as fast as they can. Defence doesn't have much use in these circumstances, and whether you win or not depends more on how well you can control the ball and how great your attacking skills are.</p>

<p>I have therefore put all the posts in the order that I think is the best, and I recommend you read through them in that way.</p>

<h2>But always remember</h2>

<p>Practice, is the magic word. If you've got a soccer table at home, or anywhere else where you can play alone, I strongly recommend putting in some hours to get your technique perfect. Even then, the game is unpredictable and you will never get a 100% success rate, but that shouldn't keep you from trying the best you can. Even a few hours of extra, specific training can make a huge difference.</p>

  title: "[Foosball] Fundamentals & Rules"
  post: "<p>Before we can start having fun, it is important to know the general rules and basic structure of a foosball table</p>
<p>A foosball table consists of a <em>soccer field</em>, with a <em>goal on each side</em>, and the rest of it are <em>walls (slightly sloped)</em> and <em>4 rods</em> for each team (1 keeper, 2 defenders, 5 midfielders, 3 attackers).</p> 

<img src="media/Foosball01.png" />

<p>NOTE: If you're looking for a foosball table to buy, or how to maintain them, here's an article I recommend: <a href="http://www.foosballzone.com/foosball-table/">Foosballzone | Foosball Tables</a></p>

<p>Of course, one team's defenders are facing the other team's attackers, and the midfield-rods are facing each other. You most often play with 2 players in each team: one to defend (holding the goalkeeper-rod and the defenders-rod), one to attack (holding the midfield-rod and the attacker-rod). Playing alone against one person can also be done, but is less fun in my opinion.</p>

<p>The goalkeeper-rods can move only from the left corner of the goal to the right corner, all other rods can be moved up and down until one of the men hits the wall. All rods can be rotated a full 360 degrees.</p>

<p>The best <strong>position to stand in</strong> is therefore: standing far enough from the table so that you can comfortably pull both your rods all the way down, and standing solid on your own two feet (which means: do not lean on your rods, this damages the rods, and this only makes playing harder for you). Also, standing diagonally with your left foot forward and your right foot at the back helps: this is because your right hand needs more space to move freely. Grab the handles of your rods as if you are about to shake hands with them, your thumb diagonally facing up.</p>

<p>The idea obviously is to win the game by scoring goals yourself, and making sure your opponent does not score goals.</p>

<h2>The Rules</h2>

<p>The rules for official tournaments have a lot in them that's pretty useless (i.e. you only have a time span of mere seconds on a particular rod within which you have to shoot) if you just want to play and have fun (at school or work for example), so I'll give you the rules as they are applied in casual play:</p>

<ul>
	<li>NO SPINNING. Spinning occurs when you spin your rod 360 degrees without touching the ball. The easiest way to never spin, is to never let go of your rod/handle (and to just always hit the ball). Spinning might get you a lot of power behind your shot, but it will also make you miss the ball or goal 9 out of 10 times. It's just stupid and boring.</li>
	<li>Every new ball can be put into the field in different ways. Most tables have a hole on the side through which you put the ball. If they don't, usually the ball is rolled from the middle to the midfielders of the team that was scored against.</li>
	<li>All rods are allowed to score. However, if you score using your midfielders, the next ball will be worth 2 points (and this ball none).  If you score the last ball with the midfield, you lose.
	<ul>
		<li>An alternative is that midfield goals don't count.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Whatever happens, as long as the ball ends up in the goal of the opposition, you are awarded a point. The opponent may slightly touch the ball, or the ball might go in via the walls, et cetera, we don't care: in is in.</li>
	<li>The rule is: 'attacker is king'. If an attacker shoots a ball, and it first hits some other things and then goes in, it's always a goal from the attacker. However, if for example your defenders shoot a ball, and it hits the midfield and then it goes in, it's a midfield goal.</li>
	<li>If someone scores a goal, but the shot was so fast that the ball comes out of the goal back into play (a 'clinker'), the team that scored is awarded 2 points and playing continues.
	<ul>
		<li>An alternative is that the team that scored gets only one point, but the opposition has one point removed. And yes, counting below zero is allowed.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>(optional, to make every match more exciting) When a team loses having scored 0 goals, the team must 'crawl': crawl under the table from left to right. This is to humiliate them for being rubbish.</li>
</ul>

<p>The official rules also say the following things, which you can decide for yourself whether you want them as rules in your game:</p>

<ul>
	<li>NO JARRING. Jarring (or 'sawing', because it is the same movement you would make with a saw in your hands) is when a player slams his rods to the sides of the foosball table. This can be done to make the opponent lose  possession  of the ball, or just as a method of defending; whatever your reasons, most players hate this and forbid this.</li>
	<li>If the foosball lies dead between 2 rods (no rod can get to the ball, and the ball isn't moving anymore), the ball needs to be served again.  If you think that's boring, then you can lift the table a bit until the ball rolls back into someone's possession.
	<ul>
		<li>If the ball cannot be reached by neither <em>defenders</em> nor the <em>opponents attackers</em>, the ball automatically goes to the defenders.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>If a ball is, whatever the cause, lifted (it jumps away from the table, or it hits the head of one of the men, et cetera) the ball needs to be served again. However, if the ball is still on the field, I recommend you just play on. This is because a ball flying through the air only makes things more fun (and really good players are actually able to pass or shoot the ball through the air, and that's beautiful to see and do).</p>

  title: "[Foosball] Ball Control"
  post: "<p>Ball control is a very important aspect of foosball, which is why it's sad that most people forget about it. Most new players exploit the method of just trying to shoot every ball that comes near their rod at goal very fast, but that's wrong. Against another newbie it might score quite a lot of goals, but once you play a bit longer you'll notice it's not the best way.</p> 

<p>What you need to learn before you can do anything, is being able to quickly control any ball that comes near your rod. This not only means that you can efficiently defend any ball coming towards you, but it also makes you able to set up certain kinds of shots or passes.</p>

<p>In ball control, we can distinguish 2 styles. The one is just moving the men around the ball so that it stays in your possession, the other one is called 'pinning'. When you pin a ball, you trap the ball between the toe (or heel) of your man and the field, so that in a split second the ball is stopped completely. Many people recommend you learn this method first, but actually I'm against it.</p>

<p><em>Why?</em> Because pinning a ball is a one-chance thing. If you miss your pin, the ball just continues to move towards your goal/opponent at the same speed. And to make it worse, the defender of your team probably expected you to have the ball, but you don't, so that's one goal against you. Therefore I recommend that you first develop a feeling for how much pressure to put on a ball, and how a ball moves and behaves with different touches.</p>

<p>But remember: ALWAYS keep a ball in your possession. Once you have a ball, never let go of it, because in foosball your opponent can score from any part of the table. In real soccer, losing a ball to your opponent is already quite bad, but imagine what could happen in the dangerous game of table soccer&hellip;</p>

<h2>Ball Control Exercises</h2>

<h5>1. Knowing where the ball will end up.</h5>

<p>The first skill in ball control is, of course, actually getting the ball in your possession. To be able to do so, you must be able to instantly put your men where the ball will end up. This requires some training, for which we have the following exercises:</p>

<ul>
	<li>(randomly) Passing the ball back and forth between two of your rods. Of course, if you can't pass at all this is good because then the ball is moved in random directions. However, once you get better this exercise is useless, as people can't be completely random. One way to fix this though, is to put a small book or something under one of your table's legs, so that every ball you shoot is curved into a certain direction, making everything a bit harder (and more random).</li>
	<li>Ask someone to shoot balls at goal, and try to save them.</li>
	<li>Push/shoot the ball against the wall with your man. This way the ball bounces off in a random direction, and then it's your turn to quickly stop that ball.</li>
	<li>Something a bit more advanced: ask someone to shoot at your goal from their defense. Try to position your midfield and attackers in such a way that you can stop every ball.</li>
</ul>

<p>A tip: angle your men a bit backward, so that a ball is slowed down very much when it hits your players, that way it's easier to control the ball and it doesn't bounce away.</p>

<h5>2. Keeping a ball in your possession</h5>

<p>The next thing you want to learn is keeping the ball in your possession after you've had your first touch.</p>

<p>The basic rule is that you always keep in mind where a ball will go. If a ball from the right is stopped by your man, it will of course bounce back to the right a bit. If a ball is traveling diagonally downwards the table, you know that once you hit the ball it won't just neatly bounce back in front of you, so prepare for that.</p>

<p>A really good defender will always be able to make any ball coming towards him bounce off in such a way that (s)he keeps the ball. For example, I once played against a really good defender, and every angled ball that hit his defenders, would bounce off vertically to his other defender, so that he almost always immediately had an open shot at goal.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Put the ball down before the feet of one of your man. Now just start moving the ball back and forth, left and right a bit, but keep it in possession. If you feel really kinky today, try moving the ball from one of your men to another (still making sure the ball is never lost!)</li>
	<li>Ask someone else to shoot balls at you (or try to roll them in yourself, but it's quite hard to do properly), from all possible angles. Your task is to immediately adequately stop a ball.</li>
</ul>

<p>A tip: there are basically 2 ways to keep a ball in your team. The first one is the safest one, the second one is harder but much more difficult for the opposing team to handle.</p>

<p>The first method can be applied to all types of shots: angle your men backward, and just follow the path of the ball until it stopped at your feet.</p>

<p>The second method is different for every shot.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shots coming from the side (angled shots): hit the ball with the side of your man, so that it is immediately passed to another men of yours.</li>
	<li>Straight shots: these can be shot back immediately. Why? Because usually when somebody shoots a straight shot, performing the shot doesn't keep his men in the same position. Therefore, if you're quick, there should be some easy shots (either straight or slightly angled (most shots aren't perfectly straight)) you can just shoot.</li>
</ul>

<h5>3. Pinning a ball</strong></h5>

<img src="media/Foosball02.png" />

<p>Once you've mastered the basic controls, and you (almost) never lose any balls anymore, it's time to go advanced, and make sure every ball coming towards you is immediately in your possession. This is where pinning comes into play.</p>

<p>As said earlier, pinning is when you trap the ball between the toe/heel of your man and the field. As long as you don't lift your man, the ball isn't going anywhere. Therefore, if executed properly this is the best way to catch any ball and then keep it in the team. However, at first it's very hard to get the right timing when trying to pin, but with the following exercises you should be able to master this craft!</p>

<ul>
	<li>Move the ball back and forth on one of your men. Choose a man, and put the ball under it in 'back pin' position. Now try to let go of the pin, and move the ball a bit forward. While doing so, rotate your man and do a front pin. Now do the same thing but backwards. Repeat.</li>
	<li>Shoot the ball from any rod on the table to your next rod. Try to immediately pin the ball on the receiver side. NOTE: Try it from both sides. For example, first shoot with your midfield to your attackers (and let your attacker pin the ball with a front pin). Then shoot from your attackers to your midfield (and let the midfield do a back pin). Why should you try it both directions? Because the first direction is for when you're attacking, and the other way is useful for when you're defending.</li>

  title: "[Foosball] Passing"
  post: "<p>Now that you're able to catch a ball and keep it in your team, it's time for you to do something useful with it (like scoring some goals). Many people who start playing foosball only know how to shoot. In fact, they think all you do in foosball is very rapidly shoot balls towards the opponent's goal. But the truth is: learning to pass the ball is perhaps more important than being able to score a goal out of it. Why? Properly passing a ball will create a lot of chances in front of goal for you. Then it doesn't matter how good your opponent is at defending, at least a few of your big amount of chances should go in.</p> 

<h2>Two different ways to pass that ball</h2>

<p>Passing a ball in foosball is a very subtle thing. Overpowering a pass almost never does you any good, at least not if you're a world class player. There are 2 types of passes, which we can categorise as  <strong>vertical (on the same rod)</strong>  and  <strong>horizontal</strong>  <strong>(between the different rods)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Vertical</strong>  passing means passing from one man to another on the same rod. How to do this? Pushing or pulling the ball with the side of your man. Then receive that ball with the side of one of the other men on the rod. Why is this useful? Constantly passing on the same rod will make it difficult for the opponent to keep following and defending you. Therefore it creates holes through which you can then horizontally pass to the next rod.</p>

<p>Some tips: it's hard to pass vertically and perfectly straight. Therefore from time to time a ball will roll a bit away from the rod. Then it's your turn to show the world your ball control skills, and keep that ball in possession.<br />
Also, receiving a ball with the side of your man is quite hard, because a ball can easily bounce off in weird directions. Therefore, when passing vertically it's best to slowly slow down a ball. This means that the receiver follows the direction of the ball for a about an inch so that the ball is eventually stopped right before his feet.</p>

<p><strong>Horizontal  </strong>passing means passing from one rod to another (usually forward, but in some situations it could be quite surprising to suddenly pass backwards, I must say). Passing this way, the ball usually moves a bit slower than actual shooting, which means that a straight pass is easily intercepted by the opponent. Therefore, for horizontal passing we use the  <strong>brush pass</strong>  method.</p>

<p><img src="media/Foosball03.png" /></p>

<p>When you brush pass, you gently brush the ball in a certain direction. This gives you almost 100% certainty that the ball will go in the direction you wanted. The only downside is that the ball moves a bit slower, so against really good opponents you should try to do it faster, but most of the time brush passes aren't easily defended against.</p>

<p>Of course, the whole thing can be reversed to pass the ball downwards. The ball can also be shot via the walls of the table if you like (which is awesome, you should train yourself to be able to do so!).</p>

  title: "[Foosball] Shooting"
  post: "<p>With shooting it is really a trade-off between accuracy and power. You can shoot a ball blazing fast, but then you lose control and won't be able to aim it accurately. On the other hand, there are shot types that have a certain speed limit, but are very hard to defend against yet easy to place in the corner.</p> 

<h2>Three different ways to shoot that ball</h2>

<p>There are 3 main ways to shoot a ball:<strong>  wrist flick</strong>,  <strong>handle roll</strong>  and  <strong>backflip</strong>.</p>

<p>The  <strong>wrist flick</strong>  is the most standard shot that everybody knows. It's basically just throwing/flicking your wrist down while holding the handle, which makes the handle quickly rotate.</p>

<p>NOTE: Do not flick your hand down, as this just puts pressure on the rod and makes twisting it harder. Think of it as turning your wrist until it can't be rotated further, it 'locks'. This might sound dangerous, but it really isn't. So when doing the wrist flick, just rotate your wrist with all the power you have until it can't go any further.</p>

<p>This is the easiest one to execute and the easiest one to keep control over the ball with, but it's also the slowest one.</p>

<p>The  <strong>handle roll</strong>  can, if trained properly, be executed just as quick and precise as the wrist flick, but it's a much faster shot. A handle roll means, as the name implies, rolling the handle in your hand. For this to happen, you need to partially let go of the handle, and only let the palm of your hand touch it. Now, without losing touch, you can roll the handle, making your man swing. This can be done very quickly, the only difficulty here is switching from your normal grip to a handle roll (but as I said, training is the key).</p>

<p>The  <strong>backflip</strong>  is a blazing fast shot, but requires a lot from a player to be executed properly. You need to switch to a difficult grip, the timing is different, and control is almost impossible without <em>a lot</em> of practice. Anyhow, the fun thing about backflips is that they are so fast that the opponent could never react in time, and even if you miss it makes the ball do unexpected things. To do one, your hand needs to let go of the handle, and only let your wrist touch it. If you then quickly move your hand up, until you're able to grab the handle again, your man should have made a full flip. This is allowed, as seen that it hits the ball just before the full flip is done.</p>

<h2>Shooting (on goal): a few examples</h2>

<p>Once you know the different techniques available, it's time for you to start being creative. There are numerous ways to shoot on goal, which mostly depend on your position on the field and your opponent's defence.</p>

<p>We shall first discuss the possibilities for your  <strong><em>ATTACKER</em></strong>  rod:</p>

<p><em>The  <strong>black</strong>  arrows indicate shots that can be taken immediately at goal.</em><br />
<em>The  <strong>brown</strong>  arrows indicate that you can of course always pass to another man.</em><br />
<em>The  <strong>red</strong>  arrows indicate that you can also move (pull/push) the ball a bit and then shoot.</em></p>

<p>Please note: the size of the men is a bit bigger in the drawings than in real life, and the blue men in the drawings are just an example of a possible defence.</p>

<p><strong>The Middle Man (of the 3-rod)</strong></p>

<p><img src="media/Foosball04.png" /></p>

<p><strong>The Outer Man (of the 3-rod)</strong></p>

<p><img src="media/Foosball05.png" /></p>

<h2>Famous Shots</h2>

<p>The  <strong>push shot</strong>: using the middle man, move a bit up and then shoot the ball straight into the upper corner of the goal.<br />
The  <strong>pull shot:</strong>  reverse of the push shot. Move the middle man down and shoot the ball straight into the lower corner of the goal.</p>

<p>The  <strong>pull-kick:</strong>  starting with the upper-man of the 3-rod, pull the ball to the middle man, and then rapidly shoot with that man.<br />
The  <strong>push-kick:</strong>  reverse of pull-kick. Start with the lowest man of the 3-rod, push the ball to the middle man, and shoot.</p>

<p>The  <strong>snake shot:</strong>  start with the ball in front pin for your middle man. Then slightly move either left or right, lifting your man off the ball in the process, and then at a certain moment (usually you're your man is as far right or left as it can be) shoot straight at goal. Can be done with a backflip as well.<br />
The  <strong>push/pull shot</strong>  (using your outer man): start with one of the men on the outside of the 3-rod, and the ball inwards. Then move the ball towards the middle a bit (keep the ball close to your man!), and then shoot at an angle (towards the far post) or straight (into the near post).</p>

<p>The  <strong>spray shot:</strong>  any angled shot is called a 'spray shot'. Angled shots are very hard to defend against, but are also very hard to master as an attacker. The angle of a shot is determined by the angle a ball's traveling in the moment it's released from the man. Once the ball is released, it will always keep traveling in the same direction until it hits something. That is, unless a certain effect is put on the ball, but it's very very hard to consciously put an effect on the ball.</p>

<p><img src="media/Foosball06.png" /></p>

<p>And now that that's discussed, you of course also want to know what the possibilities are for your  <strong><em>DEFENDERS</em></strong>  rod to score:</p>

  title: "[Foosball] Defending with goalkeeper + defenders"
  post: "<p>A great defending team always wins a foosball match. Because, if a team effectively takes away all the possibilities for the opponent to score, they will not get any goals scored against them, which in turn automatically makes winning a lot easier. And in foosball, every moment the other team has the ball, you should be defending.</p> 

<p>Many people make the mistake thinking that only the <em>goalkeeper + defenders</em> are for defence, and they rely completely on those to save every shot. But truth is, those two just can't save every shot. Plus, the earlier you intercept the ball, the earlier you can start attacking </p>

<p>What I'm saying is: the person holding the midfield and attackers has an equally important defensive position as the person holding the goalkeeper and defenders. Below I will show you different situations in the game and the best way for the defending player to behave/move. The attacking player's duties will be discussed next chapter.</p>

<h2>Defending against opponent's goalkeeper + defenders</h2>

<p>If you're holding the defending rods, you should always be alert. Wherever the ball is in the field, there's always a good chance it will come flying towards goal. Your goal as a defender is: any ball that comes near your 2-rod (the defenders) should be stopped and controlled there. Most of the time, a shot will end up hitting the wall next to your goal or hitting your keeper and bouncing off, and then you need to be able to keep that ball in possession in the defensive area.</p>

<p>In short, what you have to do is: check out which possibilities the opponent has to score, and try to cover the easiest shots (when you're able to draw a line from the ball directly into your goal, that shot is so-called 'open'). This way you either force your opponent to shoot a ball which will never get into the goal or to try and shoot a very difficult shot (which will most of the time also just make the ball end up in your defensive zone because he failed).</p>

<p>When the ball is somewhere around midfield or further up the field, there's the following setup ( = set of rules for yourself) you can use as a defender:</p>

<p>If the defender's vertical position is within the range of your goal, there are straight shots available which you need to defend. This can be done by placing your men about one cm apart, and aligning this gap with the straight shot the opponent can make. This gap looks like an open shot, but is too small for a ball to actually go through it.</p>

<p>Now there are only a few options left for the opponent: shooting a quite difficult angled shot precisely into the corner of the goal, or pulling/pushing the ball and then shooting it straight (which is even harder to do), or shooting it via the walls (which is almost impossible). However, most options are blocked, and if your midfield + attacker rods are also defending, the opponent should never be able to score from this position.</p>

<p>NOTE: It depends a bit on your qualities and your playing style whether you should rotate your men a bit on this one or not. Why? If you rotate your front man a bit backward, so that its toe is pointing forward, the man has a bigger range of shots it will intercept, but if it hits the ball, the ball will most likely bounce off to the opponent's 3-rod. If you rotate your front man a bit forward, with toe pointing at your own goal, it has a smaller interception range, but each ball it intercepts will stay in your possession. You have to ask yourself the question: are my reflexes quick enough to make up for that loss of range?</p>

<p><img src="media/Foosball08.png" /> <img src="media/Foosball09.png" /></p>

<p>(The vague dark green men in the picture show the best setup for if the ball is on the lower part of the table) If the opponent has no straight option available, it can only try angled shots at goal. In that case, defending the near post is always the best option, as seen that getting the ball there is much easier than in the far corner. There's also an option available for the opposing team to shoot between your 2 men, but this is an almost impossible shot from that far.</p>

<p>In this case though, pushing/pulling the ball is a much easier thing to do, and many goals are scored this way from the defensive line. With the setup shown above a lot of these push/pulls are guarded, but you still need to keep an eye open for these kind of shots. Those shots are usually a bit slower, so if you see one coming you should have enough time to move one of your men to that ball. Any other shot: do not move your defences.</p>

<h2>Defending against the 3-rod</h2>

<p>Now, if the ball is on the opponent's 3-rod (attackers), things get a little bit trickier. The distance between the 3-rod and your goal is not so big anymore, which makes a lot of 'easy' shots available. Though, the techniques described above are still the best way to defend, so you'll also need to apply those when defending against the 3-rod.</p>

<p>Therefore, the only way to really excel in defending here, is to first of all have great reflexes and positioning, but most of all use  <strong>psychological defense</strong>.</p>

<p>Why the reflexes? Well, with every change of position of the men, or the ball, you need to instantly know what to do and setup your defences correctly.</p>

<p>But, a better way to defend is to not let your attacker control you, but make the attacker do as you wish. This is called psychological defence, and it takes some experience (and a bit of poker face) to get used to it.</p>

<p>What usually happens when the attacker receives the ball on the 3-rod is this: they get the ball, they control the ball, they look at an opening in your defence, they set up the ball, they shoot.</p>

<p>While they get the ball and control it, you need to get your defensive men in the best positions (as described above). Then the attacker will look at your defence, and now it's your job to accurately estimate when the attacker is done looking at your defence and is setting up the shot.</p>

<p>Because once your opponent has seen your defence, he probably won't look again and will start looking for a different shot than a straight one. That will give you an opportunity to stop covering the straight shots (which is what your goalkeeper is doing), and start covering all other shots (with that same goalkeeper of course).</p>

<p><img src="media/Foosball10.png" /></p>

<p>NOTE: This of course only works for the middle man of the 3-rod, all other men on the rod don't have any straight options available, and are less likely to score, which is why a somewhat professional attacker most of the time brings the ball to the middle man.</p>

<h2>An example</h2>

<p>First you see the best possible position for your men to be in, and an attacker with (roughly) all its scoring opportunities. If someone has checked out your defence and saw that a straight shot is hopeless, he'll soon spot an open gap and try to get it there. That's the moment where you subtly move your keeper to the other side (and your defender a little bit upwards to make it look like the straight shot is still covered, just in case), so that almost all holes are covered. And the attacker probably won't see the straight one.</p>

<p>The reverse is also possible: make it look like a very easy shot can be made, but in reality have it covered. An example of this could be where you leave a certain shot just open, and when the attacker shoots you quickly close it (and because it was 'just' open you can do this very rapidly, because you don't have to move much).</p>

  title: "[Foosball] Defending with midfield + attackers"
  post: "<p>Your midfield has 5 men on it, your attacking zone has 3. A quick calculation shows that the majority of your men are in that part of the field. Therefore, if you position both rods correctly, you should be able to block any dangerous shots on goal.</p> 

<p><img src="media/Foosball11.png" /></p>

<p>The idea is, just as with defence, that you don't cover the same hole twice. Therefore, your attacker should always be right in front of the opponent's defensive man, and your midfield should always have 2 people covering the holes next to your attacker. If your opponent is shooting from the side of the table a bit, it's wise to place your attacker a little bit closer to the goal (so it has a slight angle with the defenders), as any shot taken from the side at goal is angled.</p>

<p>But, what's perhaps even more important, is your control over the midfield. Once the ball is around the opponent's midfield, that's your best chance to stop the attack from the other team and start attacking yourself. Why? Because the midfield is hard to control, but 'easy' to defend (as seen that you have 5 men).</p>

<p>Let's first tell you how you don't lose the ball in midfield (<strong><em>attacking</em></strong>). Earlier, we told you everything about the so-called  <strong>Brush Pass</strong>  (a soft pass that can be very accurately angled), and that's the way to go when passing with the midfield (really, master that skill). Once you can do that quickly and swiftly, you can learn passing the ball around on your 5-rod, as this will force the opponent to reposition all the time, and that's hard to do with the 5-rod. Also, performing a brush pass via the walls almost always throws off an opponent </p>

<p>When we take  <strong><em>defending</em></strong>  with the midfield into concern, we see that the best way to do this is not by rotating the man to make the toe point forwards, but to make the toes point backwards. Why? Angling the toe to the front gives you a better chance at intercepting the ball, but almost always immediately gives the ball back to your opponent, which you don't want to happen. If you angle them the other way around, every ball intercepted will stop and be in your possession thereafter.</p>

<p>But, how do we intercept that ball? Well, just assume that your opponent can do brush passes just like you. Move your midfield a bit (up/down) all the time, kind of circling around all the options the opponent has (though, keep changing speed and range all the time, otherwise the opponent can predict when you will leave which hole uncovered). If he's lucky, he'll sneak a ball past you, but otherwise every possible pass should be intercepted. Once the ball is in your possession, pass it quickly!</p>

  title: "[Foosball] Tips and Tricks"
  post: "<p>Okay, once you know all this, you're left with a lot of different things you can do and techniques you can use, but that still doesn't completely make your game. What you should develop is a professional playing style, which can be achieved by trying to implement the following tips &amp; tricks:</p> 

<p>First of all, keep in mind  <strong>pace and surprise</strong>. What can really throw off other players are changes in speed and action. Sometimes you can take it very <em>very</em> slow, and then suddenly accelerate. You can slowly pass the ball between men for a few seconds, and then suddenly shoot. Or the other way around, quickly tic-tac the ball and then do a slow angled (/spray) shot. And perhaps you've been doing the same shot 10 times this match, now try something else to surprise the others. Just know that, playing with a different  rhythm than your opponent, basically forcing the opponent to follow your rhythm instead of their own, can help a great deal in winning (psychologically).</p>

<p>Try to  <strong>read the enemy</strong>: try to figure out their playing style, their best or favourite tricks, their way of defending---and then adapt. For example, I've taught you the best defensive positioning, but a smart player will see that you constantly use these tactics, and won't even bother trying some shots anymore, but will move straight on to the few shots that do work!</p>

<p>And last but not least: there are many little things, little tips and tricks for yourself, that you learn on the way, just playing and trying out. Always try to improve your game.</p>

  title: "How to Mix & Master Audio"
  post: "<p>Mixing audio has become a somewhat popular term lately, just as lots of people have a job during the day and are a DJ at night. While audio mixing is especially vital to that kind of music, it actually plays an important role everywhere in the music industry. If you want to produce your own album, or maybe just want a single song you've written to be recorded professionally, you'll have to learn what makes the audio mixing and mastering business tick.</p> 

<p>This guide will try to give you the best options for your tools and software, but most of its articles will be spend on basic theory of sound and the core mixing tools and strategies. These are universally represented, which means you should be able to adapt them to your own situation without any problems.</p>

<p>The first chapter will be all about what software and hardware you need, so I recommend you read through that (or have your own choice of setup installed) before doing anything else.</p>

  title: "[Mixing] Choosing a DAW & Tools"
  post: "<p>DAW stands for <strong>Digital Audio Workstation</strong>, and is basically software that enables you to work with audio files---edit them, mix them, etcetera. There are multiple ones out there, and most of them have quite a high price attached to them, but there is a free tool if you're not ready to spend that much.</p> 

<ul>
	<li><strong>(Free) Audacity</strong>. It has existed for a long time, and is the most popular DAW for people just starting out with recording their own songs or compositions. It has a vast amount of features (especially for a free tool), and can be your first step into the business. You can play around with it a bit to get a feeling of what the world of audio mixing is like, but after a while you'll notice the limits of the software and will need to upgrade. It is your decision whether you want to first learn audacity's workflow and interface.</li>
	<li><strong>(I use this one) PreSonus Studio One</strong>. The interface, overall look and workflow are better than in any DAW I've ever tried. It has all the features you will ever need, but still makes it easy for beginners to start using it to its full capacity.</li>
	<li><strong>Ableton Live</strong>. Another big player in the industry, and is most known for creating instrumental tracks. It does support recording audio/vocals, but it was originally meant as a software for live mixing, and it still has the best feature set if you want to create dubstep or dance music.</li>
	<li><strong>Propellorhead Reason</strong>. Doesn't support audio recording, but is focused on instruments. It is therefore by far the best tool if you are creating instrumental tracks and want all possible options and variations in the world.</li>
	<li><strong>Cubase</strong>. It is cheaper and more abstract/difficult for newcomers, but its lower price tag and long-time existence makes lots of people use it.</li>
	<li><strong>Pro Tools</strong>. I've never used it, and I've seen lots of people migrate from this one to studio one. It does however offer roughly the same amount and type of features, and is often called the Windows equivalent of Logic Pro. It has the biggest use rate amongst professional studios that don't use Apple devices.</li>
	<li><strong>(I've used this one) Logic Pro</strong>. Mac only. If you own a Mac, there's usually already a small sort of DAW installed that is called <strong>GarageBand</strong>. It is perfect for people playing around with mixing and mastering, and people who don't need a lot of special options. If you do want more professionalism, you can use Logic Pro, which looks, feels and works mostly the same as GarageBand. I can recommend it, I only stopped using it because my Mac died.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choosing your tools</h2>

<p>With tools, I mean what you're going to record with. What you're using to listen to the sound is also important, but that is discussed in another chapter (monitoring).</p>

<p><strong>Microphone</strong>. A microphone is needed to record any audio, like vocals, guitar strumming, etc. The proper ones start from a price of about 100-150 euros, and I have one in that range that has worked well for me for more than six years now.</p>

<p><strong>MIDI Device. </strong>Usually, it's a keyboard, but there are alternatives. It is basically a device where you can press buttons and turn around switches and all, and it will send those signals to the computer. Then your DAW will interpret them as the tones of an instrument, and that's how you can emulate lots of instruments. A good keyboard usually also starts from about 100 euros.</p>

<p><strong>Audio Device or Audio Interface.</strong> For a small setup, this is not needed. Your computer or laptop probably has enough USB ports to plug in the necessary items, or you can just swap them whenever you need one. However, if you want to record multiple things at the same time, or you want to have a setup where you never need to change or fiddle with it, you need an audio device. It's a big heavy box that has lots of inputs, and (sometimes lots of) outputs. It also has some buttons on them with which you can already edit, alter and mix some of the sounds before or while they are put into the DAW.</p>

<h2>Getting ready to Roll!</h2>

<p>Now that you have all the tools you need, you might be tempted to think you can immediately start recording. But I have to disappoint you. Music mixing does not mean 'magically making audio sound amazing'. You can use MIDI instruments if you're okay with the way they sound, but if you for example want to record vocals, you'll need to practice singing the song before pressing the big record button. With some effects, you can make your voice stronger, fuller and correct some very tiny mistakes in pitch---but that's absolutely as far as you can go.</p>

<p>For example, for recording guitar, the sound of strumming and switching between notes or chords is also needed to create a proper recording. All I'm saying is: you'll still need instruments and some skill with them to create a song.</p>

<p>Now you are ready to go! The first few chapters are about terminology and theory behind mixing &amp; mastering---if you're going to read something, at least read that. There's a chapter about monitoring, but if you don't have the money to spend on high quality monitoring systems you can skip the smaller section about that as well.</p>

  title: "[Mixing] Audio and Sound Waves Theory"
  post: "<p>You've probably already seen some of this at high school physics class, and thought 'well, what is this useful for?' at the time. This is the moment you've been waiting for.</p> 

<p>When mixing audio, you'll be working with audio files. Audio files are files that have 0's and 1's in them that represent a sound wave. There's certain aspects we can change with the computer, and some that we just simply can't---or at least not without a lot of special effects. To understand why this is, and to understand why certain actions have a certain effect, you'll need to know the theory behind audio.</p>

<h2>Sound Waves</h2>

<p>In its purest form, a sound can be represented as a sine wave. Sound is a longitudinal wave, which means it has spots where the air molecules are pressed together alternating with spots that have more space between them. These differences in pressure are interpreted by our ears as sound.</p>

<p>But, trying to easily represent a wave made of compressed and not-so-compressed parts is hard, so we use the normal representation of waves: a sine graph.</p>

<p><img src="media/SoundSineWave-01.png" /></p>

<p>A sine wave has two important properties:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Amplitude:</strong> How far away from the centerline the highest (and lowest) points are. A greater amplitude means a louder sound.</li>
	<li><strong>Frequency </strong>(in <strong>Hz</strong>)<strong>:</strong> How many times it loops through (or 'completes') a full period, per second. A higher frequency, means a higher pitch.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>Decibel Scale</h2>

<p>The decibel scale (dB) is used to represent how loud a sound is. However, it is not a convenient linear scale:</p>

<ul>
	<li>+3 dB means that the power of the wave is multiplied by 2</li>
	<li>+10 dB means the power of the wave is multiplied by 10</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Power of the sound wave?</em> A wave basically transports energy. The power of a wave is the amount of Joules it transfers per second. Every sound therefore has a different perceived loudness which is based on its power. The formula is:</p>

<p>Power = log( W ) - 12</p>

<p>The take away from this is that you can't easily relate a change in decibel to a change in power/volume. For example, say your track is at a level of 35 decibel, and you increase it with 3 decibel. Then the power of your sound isn't multiplied with (38/35), but it increases logarithmically. You must therefore be careful with dB increases and decreases, and a track that's too loud may permanently damage someone's audio system, while a track that's too soft can only be increased in volume by a limited amount until the recording becomes nothing but noise. Record and mix at appropriate levels.</p>

<h2>Frequencies</h2>

<p>A regular human being can hear frequencies between 20 and 20,000 Hz. This seems like quite a lot, but there's one thing you should know---frequencies also are a logarithmic scale.</p>

<p>If you for example increase a sound's pitch from 20 Hz to 40 Hz, you're not just making it a little higher, you're actually moving upwards a whole octave! Therefore, subtle differences in low frequency ranges are much more important (or disturbing) than ones in higher ranges.</p>

<p>In order to mix music properly, you'll need to know what range a certain instrument can play, and you'll need to be able to quickly guess what frequencies you're hearing. If you're listening to your recording and you're hearing some notes in the low or high end you don't like and want to cancel out, you don't want to search for 30 minutes until you've found it---you want to be able to fix it within minutes.</p>

<h2>Actual Audio</h2>

<p>I've just described some very basic theory behind sounds, but that's not how it works in the real world. You never hear only one pure sound wave.</p>

<p>When you strum a guitar, you're pressing the strings with your fingers to create a certain note. You might think 'hmm, I am playing an E, it sounds like an E, great!', but you're hearing much more than that. The guitar is one big <em>resonance box</em>, and what such a box does is create a space for your sound waves to bounce around in. When sounds are deflected off the walls of your wooden guitar, they increase in frequency and create so-called <em>overtones</em> or <em>harmonics</em>. Those are what create a full and beautiful sound. The same thing also happens with your voice: when you sing (with some proper vocal technique at least), you sing the note you want, and the sound travels into your skull and resonates there to create extra frequencies, and that creates a fuller, louder and nicer sound.</p>

<p>So in reality, every sound you hear is a collection of a basic note (the <em>tonic</em>) that is the most prominent, and a collection of overtones surrounding it to give it some more life.</p>

<p>What this has to do with mixing audio, is that you sometimes don't want these overtones or you want certain ones to be more prominent. If you've recorded a guitar solo but it sounds too muddy or lifeless to you, you might have accidentally recorded some lower notes that you didn't want. That's what mixing is for: cutting out what you don't want, and enhancing what sounds great to you.</p>

  title: "[Mixing] Terminology & Common Practices"
  post: "<p>Before we can continue, I feel it is necessary to explain a lot of jargon that surrounds the music editing industry. Lots of difficult or seemingly irrelevant words are used for simple and basic concepts, and not knowing those can make it much harder for you to find your way around a DAW.</p> 

<p>I'll also include what I think is the best and most common way to setup new projects, master an album when you already have a collection of songs and optimal workflow.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Monitoring.</strong> Listening to certain parts (or the whole) composition, with the intention of hearing whether there are any mistakes or if you like how it is now.</li>
	<li><strong>Track.</strong> A single part of the composition. The track can have an instrument fixed to it, or several audio files on it. A track can be <strong>muted</strong> (you don't hear it), <strong>solo'd</strong> (you only hear this one) and be <strong>record enabled</strong> (if you press record, record the audio to this track).</li>
	<li><strong>Layers or Takes</strong>. These are not the same as tracks. They can be used if you have different recordings of the same piece of the song, and want to save them all. Most DAW's allow you to quickly cycle through them and pick some piece out of each to assemble the best possible audio for that part.</li>
	<li><strong>Envelope.</strong> A channel that is on almost every track/instrument/effect, that sits around it 'like an envelope'. It is usually represented by two lines above and below (the track), and you can drag them around to determine volume at certain parts, in what ear to play the current track, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Bus. </strong>A track that gets other tracks as input and can then apply something to all of them. You can see it as a way to group music-wise connected tracks, so you can apply the same effect on all of them.</li>
	<li><strong>Automation.</strong> Animating with keyframes. This means nothing more than setting different levels for certain settings within the same piece of audio/midi.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>Mono vs Stereo</h2>

<p>Mono means that a sound is output on a single channel. If you have multiple speakers, both will output exactly the same sound, at every spot. Stereo is when the sound is output using two channels, LEFT and RIGHT. As most people nowadays have earplugs or headphones that support this, it is used most of the time, as it provides a much better experience.</p>

<p>The rule here is: if your song sounds good in mono, it will sound good in stereo. If your song sounds good in stereo, you will need to check mono because you can't be sure. And while we're on the subject: checking a composition in mono is always a good idea, as it points out mistakes or things that just don't sound quite right yet.</p>

<h2>Audio vs MIDI</h2>

<p>These are the two main ways to record and create music. They both have their own purpose and workflow, and I'll touch on those only lightly here:</p>

<p>Audio is recorded with a microphone. It represents raw recordings or something you sang or played in front of that mic. It is usually represented in the software by a sound wave with amplitudes showing volume at certain spots. Computers can't really analyze this, so you have to listen to hear what frequencies are in there, what the tempo is, etc. Audio is therefore best for vocals and guitar-like instruments (and drums, if you have multiple mics to record every piece separately).</p>

<p>MIDI is recorded with a midi device, usually midi keyboard. It's a collection of notes, played at certain moments and for a certain amount of time. It is usually represented in the software by lots of small rectangles at different heights and with different lengths. Because the data is so basic, it can be applied to any instrument within your DAW. If you've recorded a composition with your MIDI keyboard, you can assign a Grand Piano to the track and it will sound like it was played on that kind of instrument. MIDI is therefore best for creating artificial/non-natural sounds or using instruments you don't have in your possession.</p>

<img src="media/AUDIOvsMIDI.png" />

<h2>Common Practices</h2>

<p>First of all, it is recommended to start every project completely fresh---don't import or use a template, as it is most likely to hinder your creative process, or it will at least make all your productions sound the same.</p>

<p>When you've done that, I think it is wise to create <strong>buses.</strong> Create one for every group you're going to use (drums, bass, string, piano, guitars, etc.). If your DAW allows it, you can also create actual groups inside the software for them and put every track where it should be. If it doesn't however, just create all the tracks in a logical order.</p>

<p><em>What is a logical order?</em> Well, it depends on your song, but it is always said that you should <strong>start with the most prominent or important instrument(s)</strong>. If your song has drum in it, start with that to get the rhythm right. If there's bass (which there almost always should be), use that to get the very basic notes and melodies right. If the main chord progression is played by a piano, bring that into play now. If there's some guitar melodies and a solo in there, only now start to add that.</p>

<p>There is however some space for your own decisions here. If that guitar solo lasts 2 minutes and is the turning point of your song, you might want to start earlier in getting it right. If the chord progression on piano is playing through the whole song and always prominent, you might want to start earlier with that. It's up to you how you balance prominence and importance of instruments.</p>

<p>I recommend color coding and correctly labeling all your tracks, as it gets messy before you know it. I also recommend first creating the optimal settings and effects for every <strong>bus</strong> before going in and tweaking individual instruments.</p>

<h2>Wait until you're finished</h2>

<p>Of course, while recording you want to make sure the recording is of a good quality, nothing went wrong, and you might want tweak it a little bit.</p>

<p>But, I recommend you stop there and wait until you're finished recording everything before starting the mix process. Tweaking a single track to sound great is useless, if it sounds bad when playing along all the other instruments. First look at the track as a whole, and mixing that should make the song sound good enough to be produced. Then go in and tweak the little, subtle things to make it the best quality you can possibly get.</p>

  title: "[Mixing] Monitoring"
  post: "<p>As explained earlier, monitoring is nothing more than listening to what you've created (or specific parts of it), and trying to hear what is good and what is not. It is a vital part of the mixing process, as the room you're in and the speakers you use to listen to the music can modify the sound a lot. But what may be even more important, is improving your ability to correctly judge your own sound work.</p> 

<h2>Objective Listening</h2>

<p>Obviously, listening to music and/or playing an instrument yourself gives you a better musical hearing. But that is not all I'm talking about here.</p>

<p>Mixing music is all about optimizing recordings to sound good together. If you can't identify when something's wrong and what may be the cause, you'll just be randomly guessing at what could work. There isn't just a set of rules you can follow for this, it is all about experience and experimenting.</p>

<p>Whenever you've just edited something, play through the whole piece of audio. Preferably with your eyes closed and no other distractions. Don't try to listen for that specific, just let the sound reach you. Once you've finished listening, you should decide for yourself: is this what I want? Is this better than what I previously had? Is this an improvement? Why is this an improvement, or why not? Answering these questions will give you more insight into what works well for you and what not.</p>

<p>Also, as they work more and more on a song, people have a tendency to focus too much on a single thing and overlook others. If you've been trying to get a specific piece of audio <em>just right</em> for a couple of <em>hours</em>, then that might indicate that you're being too harsh on yourself and it was fine a lot of versions ago. If you've been editing a single instrument all day, you might be overdoing it or just doing things that aren't necessary, and you should stop and work on something else or listen to the song as a whole to get the complete picture again.</p>

<h2>Speakers</h2>

<p>All computers have a set of speakers, but those are generally not ultra-high quality. While they will do the job if you're just playing around a bit and trying stuff out, if you want to come close to any really professional mixing you will need to buy a new set of speakers.</p>

<p>I won't give you a list of recommendations, just a few things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Yes, speakers cost quite a lot of money. Don't be tempted to buy cheap ones just because they look good or sound fine for all you know. If you listen to cheap ones, and then to the pricier ones, you will hear the difference.</li>
	<li>However, there's two things that can change with a price increase: the speaker will be able to play <strong>louder sounds</strong>, or the speaker will be able to play <strong>more sounds, more balanced</strong>. Working from your own room or studio, you don't need speakers that can produce the volume needed for a festival concert. You need the ones that have a more balanced output, and a higher range of frequencies it can play beautifully.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>Room Reflections</h2>

<p>While a nice acoustic is a desired attribute of a room when recording, you want to listen to music with the least reverb from your own room possible.</p>

<p>If you put the speakers as far as you can from any walls (facing towards the center of the room), you'll already notice some difference. However, there's still objects in the room (you, your chair, your table, tools, microphone, etc.) that might influence it. You can't just remove them if you need them, so put them out of the sound's way as much as possible.</p>

<p>But that still won't cut it. There will always be reverb from regular walls, sitting in a bigger room won't help (because sound travels extremely fast). If you can afford it, put foam or other isolation material on all three walls directly affected by the sound from your speakers.</p>

  title: "[Mixing] Core Controls---Volume & Panning"
  post: "<p>The <strong>core controls</strong> is a term I use for the attributes that every track and every piece of audio have, and that in the end play the most important role in making the song sound the way you want.</p> 

<p>The members of this core group are: <strong>volume, panning, timing, tempo (&amp; metronome) </strong>and <strong>automation. </strong>While not really in the same category, I will I also mention some things about <strong>record </strong>and <strong>monitor enabled.</strong> But that is all for the next chapter, let's first go over the two most important ones: volume and panning.</p>

<h2>Volume (or gain)</h2>

<p>Every track has a big vertical slider (or button) for volume. This is by far the most important button, as you probably don't want all instruments (or any instrument at all) at the same volume. The fact that it's impossible to record every instrument at the <em>exact</em> same level of loudness, and that you only want a few instruments to take the lead in your mix, make volume adjusting a very necessary tool.</p>

<p>Because of that, changing volume can usually be done in lots of places in the software (or audio interface itself, but I recommend only changing stuff in the software). And all you have to do is pull a slider down to make the sound softer, and push it up to crank up the volume.</p>

<p>NOTE: DAWs have an at first sight unusual way of representing the volume: in negative dB. When you record a something, the track is set to a volume level of 0 dB. This means the standard operating volume of the system you're working on. You can see that the volume slider in software is usually about (1/3) down the slider by default, with a 0 next to it. This means that there is a small amount of dB you can increase your track, but I will never allow you to do that!</p>

<p>Instead, if you want something to be more prominent, you should lower other instruments that overwhelm it. That's the reason that most tracks are set to a negative decibel level, which only means that it is a certain amount softer than the standard volume, and not that it creates some sort of anti-sound or whatever.</p>

<p><em>Why should we lower other instruments if we want one to be heard more?</em> Well, because increasing volume if you want something louder in the mix is a never-ending process. You might think 'hmm, let me increase the volume on the guitar a bit', and then think 'well, now I cannot hear the piano anymore, lets increase that one too', and so it goes on and on. When you can't hear something, it is usually not because it isn't loud enough, but because there are other instruments fighting for their spot which should be tamed.</p>

<p>A last general volume guideline: if you can hear the bass, it's probably too loud.</p>

<h2>Panning</h2>

<p>Panning is <em>the control</em> making the difference between mono and stereo sound. With mono sound, every instrument is panned to the same spot: center. With stereo sound, you get the possibility to place certain instruments or tracks more to the right and/or more to the left.</p>

<p>Usually, this can be done moving a horizontal slider to the left or right, and notation for panning level is <strong>L </strong>or <strong>R</strong>, followed by the amount of panning (higher is further to the side).</p>

<p>Here are some general panning guidelines:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The base drum and snare should be dead center. All other parts of the drum kit can be spread out a bit to the right and a bit to the left, just like a real-life drum kit.</li>
	<li>The bass line and lead vocals should also be dead center.</li>
	<li>The rest of the instruments and audio can be distributed left and right, although it is preferred to have them in a logical position. For example, if you have one track that plays low piano notes and one that plays the high ones, it is somehow more pleasant to have them distributed left and right respectively, because that is also their place on a real piano.</li>
	<li><strong>Balance </strong>is key here. Your left and right sides should be balanced, preferably by using the same amount of instruments. If that is somehow not possible, you can pan all instruments on one side more away from the center than on the other side to compensate.</li>

  title: "[Mixing] Core Controls---Timing & Automation"
  post: "<p>Continuing on the subject of the last chapter, I will talk about the other core controls here: timing, tempo, automation and record/monitor enabling.</p> 

<h2>Timing</h2>

<p>This one seems obvious, but I still want to say something about it. Timing is about when to start a piece of audio and when to stop it.</p>

<p>Everybody's intuition is telling them to start recording at the spot you should start playing, and stop it immediately when this part is done. While this is not wrong, there are better ways to do it.</p>

<p>First of all, to not create weird jumps in your audio you want to play through a connected piece of audio in one run. If there's an intro of about thirty seconds where you are continuously playing guitar, it is not smart to record the first 15 seconds, and then the last 15 seconds. Playing through it in one continuous recording already makes it sound nicer, cleaner and more connected. Don't be ashamed to do multiple takes on such a long piece of audio.</p>

<p>Besides that, there's usually a small bit before the actual part where you fade in or start your playing. If you start exactly at the moment your part starts, you'll miss your 'introduction' and it will seem like your instrument just fell into the song out of nowhere.</p>

<p>And lastly, it is hard to immediately get into the groove or exact rhythm of a song. Every DAW has a <strong>metronome</strong> built in, which you can set to the correct tempo and use for one or two bars before your part starts to get the tempo right. Which brings us to the next subject&hellip;</p>

<h2>Tempo</h2>

<p>Most songs have one single, continuous tempo through the whole song. The most universally used tempo is 120 BPM (beats per minute). BPM is the common way to denote a song's tempo, and BPM can be swapped for 'quarter notes per minute'. A tempo of 120 BPM means that one bar takes 2 seconds.</p>

<p><em>What is a bar?</em> A bar is a set of 4 quarter notes. Most songs can be divided into an exact amount of bars, and even verses and choruses follow the pattern of being built out of bars. The start of a bar, or halfway through the bar are the usual places to start new instruments/song pieces or to stop existing ones. If you're going for a more complicated melody, you can divide a bar into 16 equal pieces (16<sup>th</sup> notes) and use them as starting and stopping points for notes.</p>

<p>While most DAWs allow a change of tempo even after creating the project, it is of course wise to know and set the tempo beforehand. The tempo is the lifeline of your song, and if even one instrument is not timed correctly the whole mix can feel messy and out of place. It is therefore important to know your tempo, and set your grid and metronome accordingly.</p>

<p>NOTE: Of course, having a certain note or vocal just out of tempo can create an artistic effect, but use it sparingly or you'll just sound like you don't know what you are doing.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: Tempos can be changed within a song, but it is a drastic change and should be a challenge that is taken on with care. If the two tempos are too close together, it will sound like a mistake rather than an artistic choice. If the switch is too abrupt, it will sound like something is missing in your song.</p>

<h2>Metronome</h2>

<p>I've already mentioned it a few times, but it is important enough to have its own section.</p>

<p>All DAWs support enabling a metronome to click to the tempo of your song. You can usually set it to only make click sounds one or two bars before you start recording, but you can also let it click while you are playing. I recommend always using a metronome. Every instrument being timed perfectly is one surefire sign of a professionally recorded song. You might think you can just imagine the tempo in your head, but just enable that metronome to be sure and not waste time.</p>

<h2>Automation</h2>

<p>Automation is the music industry's way of saying <strong>animation</strong>. It got this special name and place, because people usually tend to talk bad about it, even though it has some great uses and advantages.</p>

<p>The reason why it is this way, is because if you mix and master your audio correctly using the other core controls, you shouldn't have to use it. People think that using it means you screwed up somewhere and want to put a bandage on the wound instead of fixing it.</p>

<p>While they have a point, automation is very well implemented in every DAW and should be used in some cases.</p>

<p>You can use automation to animate anything: volume levels, panning, effects, etcetera. I personally only use it for one thing: <strong>(cross) fading</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want an instrument to fade in or out, and it can't be achieved by playing it softer. That's when you use automation to animate the volume and create a fade.</p>

<p>There are also times when you create a part of the song using pieces of audio from different takes, or different recordings of that part. This can sometimes create weird, unnatural transitions between them, often with a click noise going with it. Using a cross-fade between the two pieces can smoothen it out, so much that somebody else will never notice there were different pieces. Most DAWs have a shortcut for this.</p>

<h2>Record/Monitor Enabling</h2>

<p>If you have an audio interface that can accept multiple inputs, you want to know about and use <strong>record enabling</strong>. Record enabling a track means nothing more than making the track record everything a certain input receives. Usually with standard settings, the track you've selected will automatically be record enabled. If you have only one input, it is simple: if a track is record enabled it will record everything from that input. If you have multiple inputs, you need to set which input to record for every track, and record enable/disable the correct ones.</p>

<p>Say you're recording a new, acoustic song, and you just want to sing and play guitar at the same time, and do the whole song without stopping. Then you could put one mic for your vocals, and one mic for your guitar, and record both at the same time as you play and sing. This way you actually perform the song, but you can still edit and mix the individual tracks later on.</p>

<p>If you monitor your mixes via headphones or a special system, then you especially want to know about monitor enabling. When you monitor enable a track, it means that you want to hear what is on the track <em>while you record</em>. You'll have to make sure the correct output is set on the track to receive the sound where you want, which is probably your headphones (because the audio from those are not picked up by mics). If you want to hear yourself loud and clear as you would sound in the song, you want to enable it. If you just want to play and hear it in the natural way (coming from the instrument), you need to disable it.</p>

  title: "[Mixing] Compression"
  post: "<p>Compression is the first technique you apply to a track, if it is needed of course. The name comes from the fact that you're <strong>compressing</strong> the <strong>dynamic range</strong> of an instrument.</p> 

<p>The <strong>dynamic range</strong> of an instrument is the range between the note with the lowest volume and the one with the highest volume. Note that this has nothing to do with frequencies---only volume. While a great dynamic range adds a lot of variety, in a digitally recorded mix it usually doesn't sound or work as well.</p>

<p><em>Why? </em>Because there is a limit to your volume, and there are other tracks trying to also get some attention. If your instrument has a huge dynamic range, there's not much room for you to increase or decrease the volume. Because if you do, you'll soon enough hit the top or bottom of the volume slider, and if you go beyond that---your track will be filled with noise. On top of that, a subtle change in volume of perhaps 1 or 2 dB might make the difference between not hearing the instrument at all, and hearing it at exactly the right level.</p>

<p><em>When would I use it?</em> Mostly with audio recorded with a microphone. If you are for example recording a guitar chord progression, you might start with lots of energy (and thus volume), but as you play on drop that spirit and play a bit softer. That is the moment you'd use compression to bring those volume levels closer together.</p>

<h2>How to Apply Compression</h2>

<p>Compression is often included as an <strong>effect </strong>or <strong>insert</strong>, which you can add to a track. Some DAWs have a special button for it, but those are still only shortcuts to it. It is an effect, because compression doesn't change the original audio file. It just changes how it outputs its volume levels.</p>

<p>Compressions work from the top. You can set a volume level, and if anything gets higher than that, it will be cut off so that it is underneath that level. This doesn't mean that everything will just be reduced to the exact same level. Every note is scaled down accordingly, so that there are still smooth transitions between them.</p>

<p>And then when you have compressed your track, its dynamic range is much smaller, and you can turn up or down the gain to get it at the level you want again.</p>

<h2>The Different Options</h2>

<p>The compression interface in every piece of software is different, but it always has these options:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Threshold:</strong> this is the max volume level I just talked about. Every note that goes beyond this is lowered and compressed.</li>
	<li><strong>Ratio:</strong> this determines how much those notes are lowered. A ratio of 1:1 means that it is lowered exactly the amount which it is too much (so it becomes the threshold's volume level).
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Between 2:1 and 5:1 is fine for most things.</li>
		<li>Lower ratios give a warmer and thicker feeling to an instrument</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Attack:</strong> How fast the notes will be lowered. When the compression detects a note that is too loud, it will bring it down to the desired level in the amount of time you specified here.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>A higher attack rate will let the first note of an instrument or first word of a vocal punch through as it starts. This is sometimes what you want.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Release:</strong> How fast it turns the volume back up for notes that are below the threshold. Opposite of attack.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>The regular settings are almost always fine, but you can play around with it to see what happens otherwise.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Gain:</strong> While this can also just be set from the track settings, it is often also included within the compression effect. Turning it up simply makes the whole compressed dynamic range louder.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>Golden Rules of Compression</h2>

<p>Never, ever, do a low threshold with a high ratio.</p>

<p>Your compression effects window should have something called a <strong>gain reduction meter</strong> (GR). As you play a track with compression on it, this should display how much the volume is reduced at that specific moment.</p>

<p>The rule here is: if this meter doesn't return to 0 several times a bar (remember, four quarter notes), you're using too much compression. If it doesn't return to 0, you're compressing <em>every note in the dynamic range</em>, and that is just plain wrong.</p>

  title: "[Mixing] EQ"
  post: "<p>EQ is short for <strong>equalizer</strong>. The name comes from the fact that it is used to balance all the different frequencies in a track. Not only is this useful to make a single instrument sound clearer and cleaner, it is also used to make sure certain frequencies from different instruments don't clash or are too loud/soft.</p> 

<p>After compression, this is usually what is applied. However, EQ is a subtle balancing practice, which means that you should always aim for the least EQ adjustments possible. If you don't think a track needs EQ, don't use it. If you think a certain frequency is being pushed away by others, you shouldn't boost the frequency on this one but cut it off from the others.</p>

<h2>How does EQ Work?</h2>

<p>EQ is an effect that makes it easy to alter volumes of specific frequencies. Humans can hear from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, but that is not the range an EQ can work. Most instruments don't go that high, so EQs usually work from 20 to 16,000 Hz.</p>

<p>What an EQ can do, is boost or cut one specific frequency point. But, because it is impossible to pinpoint the <em>exact</em> frequencies that are bothering you, moving one point also moves the ones around it slightly up or down. In graph form, that would mean that boosting a point creates a hill, and cutting it a valley. Within the EQ effect you can set the width of those adjustments to determine how much you want to take with you.</p>

<p>There are also special versions of these points, called <strong>filters</strong> or <strong>cuts</strong>, that just completely remove frequencies at the low or high end.</p>

<h2>Different EQ Options</h2>

<p>While the look is different in every DAW, there are still the same options with the same names:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Graph</strong>. There is always a graph that displays the current EQ adjustments. When you've just added the effect, this graph is a perfectly horizontal line at 0 dB. A few circles are on the line, which represent the following ranges:</li>
	<li><strong>LF, LMF, MF, HMF, HF:</strong> These are just abbreviations for low, low-mid, mid, high-mid and high frequencies. These are the five points you can alter and move around. This makes the job a lot easier, because you can think 'this guitar needs more high frequencies', and you can just go to that specific range and boost it. Usually this can be done via the buttons/sliders, but also by dragging the points in the graph itself.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><strong>Freq:</strong> this determines the center frequency of a range</li>
		<li><strong>Q:</strong> this determines the width of the boost or cut in that range, but you should remember it as the narrowness of it. That is because a higher Q means a narrower (less wide, more specific) area of adjustment.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Enable/Disable:</strong> All these ranges have a small button near them, with a minus sign in them or on/off. Don't forget to turn these on when you make changes (it might not happen automatically). You might think:<em> 'why is that button there? Why would somebody make changes and then turn off the changes he just made?'</em>. Well, it is just a quick way to test the difference between what the audio used to be and what it is after applying your changes. Turning ranges on/off can help you with quickly determining if a change was needed, if it is an improvement, if it still needs some adjustment, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>LPF &amp; HPF </strong>or <strong>HC &amp; HL:</strong> These stand for <strong>Low-Pass Filter</strong> and <strong>High-Pass Filter</strong>. Their alternative names are <strong>High Cut </strong>and <strong>Low Cut </strong>respectively. They mean the same, but the opposite use of low and high can cause confusion:
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><strong>Low-Pass Filter / High Cut:</strong> Let's the lower frequencies pass through, which means it cuts off the high frequencies. By default, its value is 16,000 Hz. You can only move that value down, and it does what you think it does: everything above its value gets cut off. But again, this is done gradually and you should see a smooth curve in your graph at the right-hand side.</li>
		<li><strong>High-Pass Filter / Low Cut:</strong> Let's the higher frequencies pass through, which means it cuts off the low frequencies. By default, its value is 20 Hz. You can only move that value up, and it works the same as the Low-Pass Filter: everything below its value is smoothly cut off</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Gain</strong> or <strong>Input/Output:</strong> Decreases or increases volume on all frequencies. This is useful if you want to completely cut off some frequency in the mid-range, or boost a frequency <em>a lot</em>. If you for example lower the gain, there is more room above the 0 dB line for you to boost frequencies. Use it with care though.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>Golden Rules of EQ</h2>

<p>When you <strong>boost</strong> frequencies leave the <strong>Q</strong> low (the boost area is wide and smooth), when you <strong>cut</strong> frequencies make the <strong>Q </strong>high (the cut area is narrow and precise).</p>

<p>For everything else than bass, kick drum and sometimes snare you often want to use a <strong>HPF</strong> (or <strong>LC</strong>). Most instruments (and vocals) don't need or even produce low frequencies, but they can still slip in somehow and be more prominent than you like. Using a filter on the LF range removes a lot of noise and muddy sounds.</p>

<p>Equalizing is about <strong>balance</strong>. If you boost something, something else should be cut to keep the overall sound level the same. Remember that less is more.</p>

  title: "[Mixing] Delay & Reverb"
  post: "<p>Most people are confused about the difference between delay and reverb. It is true that they both basically repeat your sound to make it sound like an echo are as if it's in a great concert room, but they do it in a different way.</p> 

<h2>Delay</h2>

<p>A delay does exactly what its name promises: it adds multiple <em>delayed</em> versions of your audio. For example, if I press a key on a piano with delay on it, I will hear the exact same key again every few milliseconds. It depends on your settings if it is slowly fading out, or kept at the same volume.</p>

<p>But, what essentially happens, is that the exact same sound is reproduced with a delay.</p>

<p><em>What would I use it for?</em> Its most common use, is for echoing a specific (prominent) note at the same rhythm or tempo of the song. You just play the note once, at the right time, and then later you put a delay on it to repeat it in the groove of the song. This is used a lot in the dance industry. But, you can also use it in other types of songs to create a certain spacy, open and free effect.</p>

<p>Another very common use is for vocals. When you record vocals, you usually stand really close to the mic and get it on there as clean as you can. That's good, but when thrown into the mix it sounds as if the singer is about to jump out of your speakers and the vocals are not cooperating with the other instruments. Adding a (small and subtle) delay creates some space around it, without the complexity of a reverb. The delay must be close to 0 milliseconds though, otherwise it will interfere with the vocal itself.</p>

<h2>Reverb</h2>

<p>It's the more complicated brother of delay. With reverb there is an extremely vast array of options available, and there are lots of different types.</p>

<p>Reverb is different from delay in the sense that it doesn't just repeat your sound, but it simulates the deflection of the sound off the room, other instruments, etc. When you add a reverb to something, its sound is not send directly to the speakers, but the software calculates the different sound waves and volumes that would be present if your room had a certain acoustic and sends those instead.</p>

<p><em>What would I use it for? </em>A lot. Reverb adds some space to instruments, it backs them off from the speakers and puts them all together as if they were played at the same time, in the same room, and then recorded. On top of that, reverb adds some extra tones, some extra depth and weight that would also naturally occur.</p>

<p>You can use reverb however you want on all separate instruments, but I suggest using a subtle reverb on <em>everything</em> (<strong>global reverb</strong>), and then using another one on every bus ( = group of instruments that belong together) to really place every instrument at its own spot in the room.</p>

<h2>All Delay Options</h2>

<p>As usual, some DAWs have slightly different names, but at least all the options I will discuss are there. Also, most effects or instruments have a small delay section built-in. This is helpful because it is quick and very specific, but it usually has fewer options than a full-fledged delay effect.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Feedback (FB):</strong> What volume very delayed repetition should have. For example, setting it to 50% means that the delayed signal is exactly the same note but only half the volume.</li>
	<li><strong>Low Cut (Low): </strong>Set to a certain frequency level. Every frequency below that is not included in the delay.</li>
	<li><strong>High Cut (High): </strong>Same idea as low cut, but for the highest frequencies.</li>
	<li><strong>Tempo (1/4):</strong> For how much time it is delayed. Setting this to the tempo of the song is usually preferred, the button/slider usually has indicators at the side for 1/4<sup>th</sup> notes.</li>
	<li><strong>Dry/Wet (Mix or Blend):</strong> If a delay is dry, it means that its effect is negligible. If a delay is wet, you're using the maximum effect it allows. As the names 'mix' and 'blend' suggest, this determines whether (and how much) the delay blends with the original sound.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>All Reverb Options</h2>

<p>There's really too many different plugins, effects, extras and options when it comes to the world of reverb to cover here. So I will give you the options that a small reverb section included with most instruments/effects has, and that are the most important. I'll also talk a bit about the different types that exist.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Pre-delay (Pre):</strong> Determines the amount of time it takes for the first reflection to start. A small pre-delay is often used to offset the reverb from the original track a bit, to prevent clashing. A large pre-delay is used to simulate a large room. Standard value is usually 0 milliseconds.</li>
	<li><strong>Damping:</strong> Determines how much higher frequencies are damped/softened/removed. A high damping value will remove the edge from a sound and make it warmer and brighter. A small value gives a sound more air.</li>
	<li><strong>Low Cut &amp; High Cut (Low &amp; High):</strong> Same as with delay, they determine whether really low or high frequencies are used in the reverb.</li>
	<li><strong>(Room) Size or Decay Time:</strong> As you would expect: it's a value, set in milliseconds, that determines for how long the reverb will keep going. A large value is used if you want to simulate a large room (a big pre-delay helps there). Big reverbs are also useful for soloed instruments, but when multiple instruments are playing together you want to have a much smaller size.</li>
	<li><strong>Dry/Wet (Mix or Blend):</strong> The same as with delay, it determines how prominent the reverb is for the track.</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually, a distinction is made between <strong>natural reverbs</strong> and <strong>the rest</strong>.</p>

<p>There's the <strong>hall reverb</strong> and the <strong>room reverb</strong> that belong to the natural group. That simply means that they try to be as close to how it works in real-life as possible. They try to simulate your instruments actually being in a hall or room.</p>

<p>And then there's the <strong>plate reverb, spring reverb </strong>and <strong>convolution reverb</strong>. The plate reverb simulates the sound being reflected by a single, straight metal plate. Spring reverbs emulate mechanical reverbs for a metallic sound, while convolution reverbs can load an impulse file that defines the room's characteristics. These belong to <strong>the rest</strong>, because they don't create a natural reverb. They are used for electronic, artificial sounds and effects.</p>

<h2>Golden Rules for Delay &amp; Reverb</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Turn the reverb up until you notice it, then turn it down slightly. If you can really hear the reverb, it's too much and it needs to be pushed back (usually by about 10-15%).<br />
	<br />
	That's where another difference with delay comes into play: delay is an effect you usually want people to actively notice, unless you're using it with a very small time difference to give vocals or instruments some more weight.</li>
	<li>Remove the high end. 90% of the time, delays and reverbs sound bad because there's too much high frequencies flying around and interfering with the sound you want. Use a high cut to remove them, usually around 5 kHz is good.</li>
	<li>Watch out for the low end. While this may seem the polar opposite of #2, I mean that leaving the very low end in will make an already low sound seem like it is drowning in muddiness. In that case, also cut some of the low end, but <strong>not</strong> as much as with the high end.</li>
	<li>Create a stereo sound. If you have an instrument panned to the left, you can create a delay of about 10-50 milliseconds on the right-hand side to make a wide, stereo sound.<br />
	<br />
	You can also use automation and delay to animate moving a sound left to right (or vice versa), which can be an awesome effect to add. But, it is much more noticeable and disturbing if used where it isn't needed, so be cautious.</li>
	<li>Match it to tempo. Although already discussed before, matching delays to the tempo (or 16<sup>th</sup> notes of the tempo) is way better than just randomly picking something.</li>

  title: "[Mixing] Tips & Tricks"
  post: "<p>Having this set of rules and basic theory is great, but there's much more to explore. Even ignoring the rules on purpose can make or break your mix, but I think that should only be done if you want that little something special that you can't get by following the rules.</p> 

<p>Because this basic course is already running a bit long, and I've told you almost everything I know and use daily, the list of tips and tricks will be short:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Know your frequencies. I've given you an overview of all the different EQ bands and their purposes, and it helps a lot if you know them. Also remember that the difference between 50 and 100 Hz is the same (soundwise) as between 5 kHz and 10 kHz.</li>
	<li>That brings me to the next point: be careful with drums and bass, and low frequencies in general. Good low frequencies should not be the most prominent or loud ones, but should give your mix some solid ground to work from. Start by getting the low frequencies right, and then when you start adding more and more instruments, cut off the low ends with a low cut or high-pass filter.</li>
	<li>Already touched on in the first few chapters: it's best to create buses and folders/groups for every type of instrument in your mix, and first apply any effects there. Only if it still doesn't feel right, go in and tweak little details on single instruments or tracks.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Note Taking</strong> method. Once in a while, grab a pen and piece of paper, and sit down comfortably with a table in front of you. Play your mix, all the way from start to finish, and take notes about what you like, what you don't like, what you notice, etc. Don't stop, just write down as it plays. Do it a few times, and you should be left with a piece of paper full of items that need to be changed, and you've provided yourself with a To-Do list for your mix. It is easier to work crossing off list items, than to randomly seek for something to improve or do now.</li>
	<li>Take a break. This is true for everything, and therefore also audio mixing. Give yourself a break, every (half) hour. Go do something fun, something relaxing, do some sports, play some music just for fun (no recording), etc. When you come back to the working table, you feel energized, fresh and full of new ideas or ways to solve your current problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where to go from here</h2>

<p>Now is the time you start practicing with all the information I've just given you. Do a few mixes, make mistakes, try things out, try to get these fundamentals right. Many people are tempted to start trying out lots of plugins, effects, extras or other specialties---that's not necessary. All these extras are rarely used by professionals, because they usually have only a few specific purposes, and that's the only time you can use them to make your mix into magic.</p>

<p>Practice and experiment, try to mix someone else's songs or create your own album, and see how far you can get. Good luck!</p>

  title: "The Guide to Personal Hygiene"
  post: "<p>Welcome to the guide that will hopefully help you with creating good habits regarding hygiene. Lots of people get to know things as they grow up by trying them out, seeing their siblings do it or friends telling them. But not everyone, and certainly not everything there is to know.</p> 

<p>Keeping good personal hygiene should not take you more than 30 minutes a day. This guide may seem a bit long, but that is because it also explains why something is good or bad, and not only the fundamentals, tips and tricks.</p>

<p>The guide has been written by a man, which means that there are some sections specifically for men with their female equivalents missing. I hope someone can fill in the gaps for me someday soon.</p>

  title: "[Hygiene] Showering and Washing"
  post: "<p>When talking about hygiene, taking a shower or washing yourself usually comes to mind first. That's for a good reason: a shower cleans your whole body, all of your skin is washed, as opposed to a subtle hygiene habit having to do with your nails for example. Therefore, I want to start the guide with this subject. You can groom yourself better than anyone has ever done, but if all of your skin is dirty and you smell---it's not going to help.</p> 

<h2>Showering vs Bathing</h2>

<p>Some people like showers, some people like relaxing baths. But, we definitely recommend <strong>showering </strong>and not bathing. That is for multiple reasons.</p>

<p>First of all, because it is better for the environment. If you shower less than 10-15 minutes, you will always have used less gallons of water than if you were to take a bath. People also tend to throw all sorts of oils into their bath, which also aren't very eco-friendly.</p>

<p>Second of all, because it's just better at cleaning your skin. If you sit in a bath, you can give yourself lots of time to let the water around you pull the dirt from your skin. But, you'll still be sitting in dirty water for the rest of your bathing session. When showering, the water just runs straight down your body, pushing all dirt into the sink. It is also harder to scrub and clean yourself in a bath, as you can't see really see yourself or reach certain parts while sitting.</p>

<h2>Washing</h2>

<p>On top of showering regularly, you should also wash your <strong>hands</strong> and <strong>face</strong>. Anytime you have done something and move on to some other activity somewhere else, you should wash your hands. This doesn't mean that you should go crazy and wash them like every 5 minutes. It just means that if you're for example going inside after having sat outside for a while, you should wash your hands. You may not have done anything, they may not seem dirty, but just wash them just to be sure and keep them clean.</p>

<p>Together with your hands, your face is the part that is used most often during the day, and looked at by other people. Keeping your face clean is therefore very important for your overall appearance. The fact that it gets filthy faster makes it necessary to <strong>clean your face</strong> at least <strong>twice a day.</strong></p>

<h2>Best Showering Practices</h2>

<p><em>How often should I shower?</em></p>

<p>Whenever you're dirty. Most people have a habit of showering every day, either before they go to bed or just after they've woken up. They also take an extra, shorter shower if they've done some exercise.</p>

<p>While there's nothing really wrong with that, there's still some things to be said and improved.</p>

<p>First of all, showering relaxes your body, but you still need to stand up and be alert. Therefore, taking a shower and then going straight to bed isn't the best idea---you'll lie awake for at least an hour. On the other hand, showering after you've woken up means you go to bed without a wash, which means your bed becomes dirty faster and you sleep in a mess.</p>

<p>That problem could be solved by showering twice, in the evening and in the morning.</p>

<p>But, there is such a thing as <strong>showering too much</strong>. Showering removes dirt, but also oils created by your own skin to protect it and keep it smooth. If you shower too often, your skin will become dry, bare and look unhealthy.</p>

<p>Therefore, to conclude this section, you should shower at least <strong>once every 2 days</strong>, and take an extra shower only if you've <strong>exercised, had a long working day</strong> or need to look good for a <strong>date or professional appointment</strong>.</p>

<p><em>How long should I shower?</em></p>

<p>Really up to you, but just as long as it takes to clean yourself. No staying underneath it for 15 minutes because it just feels good, just put the absolute maximum for yourself at <strong>10 minutes</strong>. If it's your second or third shower of the day, keep it much shorter at a maximum of <strong>2---3 minutes.</strong></p>

<p><em>Anything I should do or pay special attention to?</em></p>

<p>A few things. Your basic idea of showering is probably just standing under the showerhead, letting the water flow all over your body. That's good, but you should also do the following things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Scrub your <strong>armpits</strong>, <strong>face</strong> and '<strong>intimate area'</strong>.</li>
	<li>People usually forget their <strong>feet</strong>, but those are not going to get clean from just standing there. Also scrub the bottom of your feet.</li>
	<li>Just before you get out of the shower, for 15-30 seconds, turn the water <strong>cold</strong>. This takes some getting used to, but it has all sorts of positive effects. It energizes you, makes sure you don't sweat after you've stepped out of the shower (which would defeat the whole purpose) and leaves your skin less vulnerable.</li>
	<li>Don't use the towel too aggressively. Your skin can only withstand a limited amount of pressure or roughness until it gets scratches, small wounds or other unhealthy side-effects.</li>

  title: "[Hygiene] Clipping your Nails"
  post: "<p>You were given 20 nails, which will never stop growing. Long nails have all sorts of disadvantages: they look bad, they are sharp and can hurt yourself or other people, they collect lots of dirt underneath them, and they can seriously hinder you in doing your daily tasks.</p> 

<p>It is therefore very wise to keep your nails short and clean.</p>

<h2>Basic Rules on Trimming Nails</h2>

<p>Nails grow at a different rate for each person, so there's no standard rule for when to cut them. But, on average, you will need to cut them once in every two weeks. If you are experiencing trouble with long nails, or they are collecting too much dirt, you should definitely cut them earlier.</p>

<p>Sometimes, your nails will collect lots of dirt without being long at all (mostly because you're work means getting your hands dirty). Then you shouldn't cut them, but pay special attention to them at least twice a day. You can do this when taking a shower, or washing your hands or face.</p>

<p>Don't bite your nails! It doesn't look good if other people see it, and your nails get rough, uneven edges. And it's not exactly healthy.</p>

<p>Don't try to clean your nails by scratching the dirt away with another one. Just clean them properly.</p>

<p>If you've accidentally cut a nail uneven, don't try and try to fix your mistake. It's a never-ending process that will make your nails too short. There's also a chance of nails <strong>growing in</strong>, which is painful and most of the times requires a doctor to get it on the right track again. Instead, try to even your nails out by using a <strong>nail file</strong>.</p>

<p><em>How far or how much should I cut the nails?</em></p>

<p>When you look at your nails, you should see two parts. A pink-ish part near the finger, and a white part at the growing end. The white part is the part of the nail that sticks out, and its color is created by the oxygen it is collecting. You want to cut the complete white part, and nothing more.</p>

<h2>Your Hands</h2>

<p>These ones grow a bit faster than your toes, and are seen by other people (contrary to the ones on your toes which are usually hidden), so these need the most care. You should cut the nails <strong>round/curved</strong>, so that its end follows the roundness of your fingertips.</p>

<h2>Your Feet</h2>

<p>These ones grow slower, but are much stronger. People usually cut them less often, but you can do them at the same time as you do your hands. The difference is mostly that you need to cut these <strong>straight</strong>. Of course, it can be curved a little, but you want the end to mostly be a straight horizontal line.</p>

  title: "[Hygiene] Brushing your Teeth (and Bad Breath)"
  post: "<p>Another very important part of your hygiene are your teeth. They get dirty all the time, and have loads of bacteria surrounding them. Keeping a clean mouth not only makes your teeth whiter, cleaner and last longer, but also reduces the amount of bad breath.</p> 

<p>Not so long ago, people thought that brushing your teeth once a day was more than enough. The quality of their teeth shows that they were wrong. Brushing your teeth once a day is the <strong>absolute minimum</strong> you should do.</p>

<p>These days there are four main tools to keep a clean mouth: <strong>regular toothbrush</strong>, <strong>electric toothbrush, dental flossing </strong>and <strong>toothpicks</strong>.</p>

<h2>Regular vs Electric</h2>

<p>The electric toothbrush has become more and more popular, and for a good reason. All you have to do is turn it on (sometimes with the correct settings), move it along both rows of teeth, and you are sure of a clean mouth. There's no chance of applying too much or too little pressure, it will reach all the hard-to-reach spots, and the very fancy ones even have timers to help you.</p>

<p><em>Why doesn't everybody use it then?</em> Because a decent one that will last for quite some time is rather expensive, and some people just want to stay in control. If you do all the work yourself, you know for sure what has been done and to what extent. Regular toothbrushes are also easier to carry with you if you travel or stay over at someone's place, and are less heavy (for some people it really makes a difference).</p>

<p>I will therefore not try to push you to one side or another, just use this information to choose which one to use for yourself.</p>

<h2>How often should I brush my teeth?</h2>

<p>Most people do it <strong>twice a day</strong>. After they've had breakfast and are about to go to work, and after they've had their dinner (or last snacks) before they go to bed. This is good, and you are assured of healthy teeth if you can keep up this habit. It's not disastrous if you sometimes drop this to once a day due to problems or certain circumstances, but never do it less than that!</p>

<h2>How to Brush your Teeth</h2>

<p>The whole point of brushing your teeth is first of all to get rid of any food leftovers on your teeth, and second of all to put fluoride on the teeth to make them strong and provide a layer of protection.</p>

<p>Therefore, before you brush, first clean your teeth by drinking some water (and moving that around in your mouth), or brushing with only water on your toothbrush.</p>

<p>Then, for about <strong>2 minutes</strong>, subtly move around your brush on every area of your mouth in a slow circular motion. Pay special attention to the gums, as cleaning those is very important, but rubbing too hard will hurt them and cause serious problems.</p>

<p>Also <strong>scrub your tongue</strong>, as it also contains some food leftovers, and not including it with your routine kind of defeats the whole purpose.</p>

<h2>Floss vs Toothpick</h2>

<p>They are becoming more and more popular, as they really do work and are necessary to use regularly. They booth reach for the space between your teeth, and rid that of any harmful bacteria. They literally put something through that space (floss wire or the toothpick itself), which can't be achieved by a brush.</p>

<p>It is therefore recommended to use one of them once a day, but even using it once every week will make a difference. Whichever you use doesn't matter: some dentists promote toothpicks, some promote dental floss. I will provide you with a small how-to on both.</p>

<h2>How to Floss</h2>

<p>Most floss wires come in a little plastic box. Before you start flossing, take out a piece of floss wire about the length of your arm. Then take one or two inches of the wire between your hands.</p>

<p>Place one end in your mouth, and the other just in front of it. Slowly move the floss wire (in a sawing motion) through the areas between your teeth. Be careful though to not try and floss some piece of tooth.</p>

<p>Because a floss wire is in between two teeth, there are two affected by its presence. It is recommended to sort of <em>hug</em> one tooth in a C-shape while going up, and then do the same with ther other tooth when moving down again.</p>

<p>When you're done with one space, get a new small piece of clean floss by moving the wire between your hands, and quickly move on.</p>

<h2>How to use a Toothpick</h2>

<p>The correct way to use them is to stick them between your teeth as far as you can. Trust me, it doesn't hurt. If it does hurt a lot, you are going too far or hitting a painful spot and should stop.</p>

<p>If your toothpick has one straight and one curved side (which most have), then the curved side should be pointing towards the center of your mouth.</p>

<p>If things start to bleed a little inside your mouth the first few times, don't worry, it's normal and should happen.</p>

<h2>Best Teeth Brushing Practices</h2>

<p>Don't brush too hard or fast, you do not need to put enormous amounts of pressure on your toothbrush or move back and forth like a madman. Doing this will only hurt your teeth and gums, and not have the desired effect. It's important that you brush every part of your mouth <em>well</em>, not <em>as quick as you can</em>.</p>

<p>Don't use too much toothpaste. It isn't healthy (if you swallow any of it), and you don't need very much either (putting a bubble the size of a pea on your brush should do just fine).</p>

<p>It's best to brush the front of your teeth in a small circular motion, the top/bottom (chewing sides, the ones pointing towards each other) in a linear motion and the back with the toothbrush going up and down vertically.</p>

<p>If you have the chance, drink or eat foods with a lot of calcium in it or chew gum (these will strengthen your teeth and keep the mouth moist). Also, try drinking beverages that are bad for your tooth ('sugarbombs') with a straw. Or avoid them altogether.</p>

<p>Replace your toothbrush every 3 months, though if you brush subtly you might be able to keep one longer without the hairs falling out.</p>

  title: "[Hygiene] Sweat and Smell"
  post: "<p>Even if you've done everything you can to get your skin clean and your teeth shining, there could still be a smell hanging around you that drives everyone away. There might even be some nasty-looking spots under your armpits because of sweat. Or even worse, you meet someone new, but your hands are sweaty for no reason, so you awkwardly try to avoid the handshake.</p> 

<p>There are some things we simply can't control or stop. You can't exercise for an hour and expect to still be perfectly clean and smelling nice, but there are easy ways to mask any bad smell or sweating problems.</p>

<h2>Deodorants vs Anti-Perspirants</h2>

<p>They do something completely different, although often used for the same reason.</p>

<p><strong>Deodorants</strong> are chemical solutions that smell really nice. Spraying some under your armpits doesn't stop any sweat or smell, but masks or hides it by creating a second, nicer one.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-Perspirants</strong> try to stop or obstruct the sweating altogether. They try to make your body sweat far less, and dry up any sweat against your skin so the smell is not released and it can't be seen through your clothes.</p>

<p>Spraying a bit of deodorant are usually more than enough. If you suffer from excessive sweating, anti-perspirants will help you out, but I wouldn't advise you use them otherwise. Your body transpires for a good reason, and you shouldn't try to make it stop doing that. Sporting in different clothes, showering or washing after any activity that may make you sweat, is the way to go.</p>

<h2>How often should I use deodorant?</h2>

<p>Usually, people spray it on before they leave for work or school. If you come home, and then later the same day have to attend something else, it is also good to spray some on. If it is a very hot day, or you're experiencing troubles with sweat in general, its best to keep it with you and spray it on regularly (when you go to the toilet for example).</p>

<p>However, do not overuse deodorant (or cologne for that matter). Use it to mask bad body smell, and perhaps give yourself a very subtle nice smell, but don't go further than that.</p>

<h2>Sweaty hands</h2>

<p>A very annoying problem. Some people just have it a lot, some people don't. Washing your hands with cool water regularly usually helps a lot, otherwise you can try an anti-perspirant. Sweaty hands of course also give off a bit of a smell, but that is hardly noticeable and isn't your biggest problem.</p>

<p>Some people also suffer from the opposite: cold hands. The remedy for this is the opposite: wash your hands with warmer water, try to use them a lot and rub them against each other to keep them warmer.</p>

  title: "[Hygiene] Washing your Hair"
  post: "<p>Your face is the most important aspect of your appearance. We've already covered washing it and keeping your teeth/mouth clean, but there's one hugely important thing we still haven't discussed: that great hair of yours.</p> 

<p>Hair just keeps on growing, for some people more than for others, but you should at least get it cut by a professional hairdresser every 6-8 weeks. This keeps your hair fresh and good-looking.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, you should also care for your hair. Over time, your hair gets more and more greasy, and starts looking bad, off model and like somebody decided to throw some butter on it.</p>

<h2>How to Wash the Hair on your Head</h2>

<p>This is the simple part, and is usually done while showering.</p>

<p>First, you moisturize your hair. Then you rub shampoo into it for a minute. Let it sink in for another minute. Then was it out until all of it is gone.</p>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>

<p>Don't use too much shampoo, and make sure you wash out all of it. Otherwise, some of it is left behind, which makes your hair unhealthy and certainly not good-looking.</p>

<p>When drying your hair, first shake your head to remove most of the water. Then gently move your towel in the same direction as your hairs. Just carelessly rubbing the towel around every spot can damage your hair. And <strong>don't</strong> use a hairdryer. It kills hairs. And they make a lot of noise.</p>

<p>Also, the more often you go through your hair with your hands, the more you need to wash it. The same is true when you use hair gel.</p>

<h2>How to Wash the rest of your Hair</h2>

<p>Although not seen as much, the rest of the hairs on your body also need some love. But, they also don't need such a thorough treatment as your scalp hair. As you wash the hairs on your head, just put a bit of shampoo on the other hairs and later let the water flow past it. It's small, but it makes a difference.</p>

  title: "[Hygiene] Shaving"
  post: "<p>And last but not least, having a certain type of beard (or no beard) makes a huge difference in your appearance. It seems like it's more of a looking-good thing than actually about personal hygiene, but that's not true. While the style of beard you choose is all about how you look, not grooming it will make it the perfect place for harmful bacteria to live and grow in.</p> 

<p>On top of that, there are other parts of your body where there's hair you can shave. While there are several people who like some hair, your best bet is to keep the amount small and the length short.</p>

<h2>Caring for The Beard</h2>

<p>Some people shave only when their facial hair becomes too long and too rough. It Is the method that takes the least effort and time, but you guessed it: it's not the right way to do it.</p>

<p>Take care of your beard every day. Preferably make it the first thing after or before you take a shower. If you want to keep a beard, simply trim it or only work on it a little. If you want a clean look, just complete shave it off every day.</p>

<p>Allowing it to grow too long, and then cutting it off all at once has a high chance of creating small wounds in your skin, which will eventually result in spots where there's no hair but a rash.</p>

<p>On top of that, wash the beard (if you have one) under the shower. To keep reminding yourself to do it, wash it at the same time you wash your hair. Do what you would also do to the hair on your head.</p>

<p>And of course, regularly check yourself in the mirror or wherever you can see yourself, to make sure there's nothing sticking in your beard.</p>

<h2>Caring for The Rest</h2>

<p>Usually, hair growth on the legs is a bit more than on the arms, but nothing is done about it. If you just keep it clean, you don't need to worry about it. Only (pro) cyclists are keen on keeping their legs absolutely hair-free.</p>

<p>Hair on the arms however, can be a problem. For some people there is none, some have a lot. Those people are better off removing some of it. Not all of it, as that will transform your whole lower arm into a big, rough sponge.</p>

<p>Sometimes, people have just random long hairs sticking out, lonely and craving for attention. Check for those once in a while, and just cut them off with a scissor.</p>

<p>Hair on the chest gets more and more as a man grows older. At the beginning all is fine, but after a while it gets out of hand. I recommend you reduce the length of your chest hair once in a while.</p>

<p>The same is true for hair on your back. Not many people have it, but if you have it I strongly recommend completely getting rid of it.</p>

<p>For back and chest hair, another option is <strong>waxing</strong>. It hurts like hell, but it is effective.</p>

  title: "[Hygiene] Tips & Tricks"
  post: "<p>We've discussed all the fundamental parts of achieving good personal hygiene. But, there are lots of other factors that play a role in the matter. However, those are more closely related to other subjects such as fitness and health, so if you want a full article on them---check those courses out.</p> 

<p>Here's a list of all the things we still have to mention:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One thing that seems obvious but isn't for all people, is keeping your butt clean. Humans were not made to poop while sitting, but rather in a <strong>squatting </strong>position. If you put something of moderate height under both your feet, you should feel that it is much easier to do it, and you (most of the time) don't even have to use toilet paper anymore. Try it out, it's worth it, and nobody can see you. If you can't or won't do it, just try to make sure you clean well after you did your business.</li>
	<li>Get enough <strong>sleep</strong>. Sleeping is good for <em>everything</em>. It removes those awful bags under your eyes, makes you look fitter and full of energy, and makes your skin smoother and healthier.</li>
	<li>Eat <strong>healthy.</strong> Another obvious one: eating too much unhealthy foods is not only bad for your teeth or weight, but also for your overall hygiene.</li>
	<li>Create a <strong>clean environment.</strong> Change your sheets at least once a week, keep your working space clean and tidy. If you have just showered, and then immediately sit on a dirty chair again, you can start all over again.</li>
	<li>Some <strong>cologne</strong>. For the men, spraying some cologne on your boxer makes that part a bit nicer, just like deodorants do for your armpits.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p>That was everything there is to know about personal hygiene. I hope I have been able to teach you something, if there is still something unclear or missing, let me know!</p>

  title: "How to Become Fit & Healthy"
  post: "<p>Being healthy and being fit are often seen as synonyms. While they do cover a lot of the same ground, there are also some fundamental differences.</p> 

<p><strong>Being Fit</strong> means having good stamina, lots of muscle power (even though it is not obvious from the outside), being able to do all daily tasks efficiently and without getting tired too quickly, being able to sport for at least 30 minutes. Being fit has everything to do with exercising enough, exercising the right way and good posture.</p>

<p><strong>Being Healthy</strong> means having no excess body fat, eating the right products and the right amount of them, getting enough sleep and rest, doing your daily tasks in a healthy manner. You could be very strong from weightlifting, but still not healthy. On the other hand, you could be healthy but still lack any reasonable stamina.</p>

<p>Therefore, where these two areas overlap, is that if you take care of them both, they will strengthen each other. Sleeping well makes you healthy, but also increases fitness---you feel more energized, your muscles have had better rest, etc. Doing exercises removes fat and increases your desire to eat proper foods. This guide will therefore tackle both of them.</p>

<h2>The Advantages</h2>

<p>I've already mentioned a lot of the advantages of becoming fit and healthy above, but here are the key points why you should do it:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Removes fat, replaces it with muscles---the look as well as functioning of your body will increase.</li>
	<li>Increases stamina and energy---you can do more in a day, feel less tired and appear brighter and vivid towards others.</li>
	<li>Increases your mood---exercising, having healthy foods in your system and having a correct upright posture all release hormones that lift your mood and spirit.</li>
	<li>It is fun---believe it or not, but doing a sport and becoming better and better at it over time is fun and motivating.</li>
	<li>If you have any sort of injury or weak spot in your body, exercising is the way to get rid of it and make it strong again. I know you may be thinking you can't exercise because it hurts so much or it isn't strong enough, but doing sports really is the only way to get back on track.</li>
</ul>

<h2>But, I have to warn you</h2>

<p>Nothing comes free in life. Giving yourself one day off once in a while is okay, even a very wise thing to do, but you have to work and push yourself every day to achieve that good-looking body. Even if you are really not in the mood, are pressed for time, or are making up all sorts of excuses not to do it---doing only five push-ups a day already makes a difference, as does swapping one unhealthy eating habit for a better one.</p>

<p>Also, being fit and healthy does <strong>not</strong> mean extremely thin. I know, some people just are born that way and it's impossible for them to gain any weight, but for most people it is much more healthy to have some body fat. There's a reason our body is so eager to store fat, and you shouldn't eat too little and exercise too much.</p>

<p>But, the advantages outweigh the time and effort you will spend easily, so just do it!</p>

  title: "[Fitness/Health] Correct Posture (Part 1)"
  post: "<p>Most of us don't realise how incredibly important your back or upper part of your body is. Your back (spine) is what sends signals from the brain to the rest of your body, and if anything there is obstructed or damaged, it will affect your body in a very negative way. On top of that, it also contains your vital organs, and you certainly don't want those to be suppressed.</p> 

<p>I could list all the advantages here, but it all comes down to the fact that with correct posture you're always using your body in the best way possible (optimal flow of oxygen and signals from the brain, but also optimal body strength).</p>

<p>But, the problem is that most people have a bad posture without knowing it. And because your body always has some sort of posture (sleeping, sitting, walking, standing), it's hard to get rid of a bad posture you've had for years, or maybe decades.</p>

<h2>What is Correct Posture?</h2>

<p>What correct posture is depends a bit on whether you are sitting, standing or lying down. But there are some fundamentals:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Being able to draw a straight line from your ears to (the middle of) your ankles. It should go through your shoulders, hips and knees as well.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Your knees should <strong>never</strong> be locked.</li>
		<li>If you're sitting, forget about the knees of course.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Having your shoulders pulled back and downwards a bit. Most people have their shoulders hanging forward a bit, which is not only bad for the spine position, but also for the strength and freedom of the shoulders.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Do <strong>not</strong> pull shoulders only backwards, or only downwards. At the bottom of your shoulder blades, near your spine, there is a big muscle that connects them to the rest of your back. Contracting this muscle automatically moves the shoulders diagonally into their good position, and it is the <strong>only</strong> muscle that you should train and feel.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Having a vertically straight neck, and chin a bit tucked in to keep your head perpendicular to the neck and looking forward.</li>
	<li>Having a slight S-curve in your back. Even though you must be able to draw a straight line, doesn't mean your back should be perfectly straight. It's shape resembles that of a stretched out S, and that is the natural and best shape for it to be in. So even though your shoulders and hips should be on the same level, there should be a bit of a curve in your back between those two points.</li>
	<li>Making your <strong>abs</strong> do the work. If you a trying to get a correct posture, you should only feel your abs. Therefore, it is good to strengthen them or to engage them while standing.</li>
</ul>

<p>These were all the key points if you're looking from the side, but the front and back also want some attention:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You should look <strong>symmetrical.</strong> This means that the left and right shoulder should be at the same level, and form a perfect rectangle with your feet. Your head should not rotate slightly to one side, and your hips should also not be rotated or twisted. If this is the case, and it is hard for you to get rid of, there might be something else wrong and you should see a doctor.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/CorrectPosture.png" /></p>

<h2>Check your Posture</h2>

<p>There are a few simple experiments you can do to check how your posture is doing.</p>

<p><strong>Wall Test 1</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Stand with your back against the wall.</li>
	<li>Make sure your head, shoulders, butt and ankles are slightly touching the wall.</li>
	<li>There should be space between your lower back and the wall, and your knees should not be locked but also have some space.</li>
	<li>If you're able to stand this way (without some parts hurting too much), you have found correct posture.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Wall Test 2</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Stand with your back against the wall</li>
	<li>Make sure your head, shoulders and lower back are slightly touching the wall.</li>
	<li>Your feet should be a few inches away from the wall.</li>
	<li>Standing like this focusses only on getting the correct posture in the upper part of your body.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Book Test</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A bit less useful, but more fun.</li>
	<li>Put a book on top of your head, and see if you can keep it there for a long time (without hands, of course) without having to move and do all sorts of head and neck movements. If you can do this, at least your head and neck have good posture and strength, and your body has good balance.</li>
</ul>

  title: "[Fitness/Health] Correct Posture (Part 2)"
  post: "<p>I've split the article on correct posture in two, as it was getting a bit too long and I don't wanted to leave anything out on this very important subject.</p> 

<h2>How to Train Correct Posture</h2>

<p>What I described above should really be seen as tests or checks, and not as exercises. They do not really strengthen muscles or create better habits, they just let you experience what good posture feels like.</p>

<p>The first and most important way to train it, is just to exercise these principles. Try to notice when you're shifting into your old, bad posture and then actively make yourself sit in the correct one for a minute before moving on. This may seem hard and unnatural at first. Your muscles aren't used to the way they're being worked now, so they may tire really quickly or feel a bit stiff. If you train regularly and don't put an enormous amount of pressure on them, this is good pain and will fade away. If it keeps hurting more and more, you're overdoing it or something else is wrong.</p>

<p>Another exercise, is to stand in correct posture and then move both your arms up until they're perfectly horizontally aligned with your shoulders. Keep them there, and perhaps wave your arms up and down a little. This is extremely hard to do, but it targets the right muscles for correct posture and upper body strength very well.</p>

<p>If you're experiencing great pain in the neck, shoulders of back from doing all this, it is better to first <strong>stretch:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Neck.</strong> Move/stretch it in all 4 directions (left, right, up, down), but do it gradually (takes about 10 seconds to get to a point you can't go further). Rolling it around in a circle is not recommended.</li>
	<li><strong>Shoulders.</strong> Put your hands behind your back, and pull your shoulders backwards. This is not good posture, just stretching. Then put your hands up in the air (still behind your back) as far as you can, and this should already be hard to do and feel like stretching while holding that posture.</li>
</ul>

<p>While doing these exercises, make sure to keep everything as relaxed as possible. I know you're training and pushing it to be in a different posture, but if you try to move to fast you'll only strain and hurt yourself more. Don't expect good posture in a few days, build it up in small steps and expect perfect posture in six months.</p>

<h2>How do I apply it in daily situations?</h2>

<h5>Standing</h5>

<p>Put your body weight on the front of your feet, as putting it on the heels naturally calls for a passive body stance.</p>

<p>It can help to think as if a string at the top of your head is pulling it towards the ceiling.</p>

<p>You should be looking straight forward. Most people have the tendency to look a bit downwards, pull your head back up to stop that bad habit.</p>

<h5>Sitting</h5>

<p>Same principles apply. Keep everything straight. Even your feet, as most people are inclined to put cross them or disturb the symmetry in any way.</p>

<p>Your back should also be straight, and you should not be leaning backwards or forwards too much. However, lots of chairs these days are of better quality, and pushing your lower back into the backrest also creates good posture. If you have to change your position or get something, do that by rotating your head <strong>and</strong> upper body instead of straining your back or turning the head too much.</p>

<p>When working at a table, make sure the angle between your lower arm and upper arm is between 45 to 90 degrees. Less than that might overstretch the elbow, more than that means you are sitting way too high.</p>

<p>Also, go stand once in a while. We're not made to sit around all day, so most people don't feel too comfortable sitting with correct posture for a long time.</p>

<h5>Walking</h5>

<p>Some people feel like they need to put their head or neck forward for some reason---don't do that. Even when running, keep your upper body straight and let your legs and abs do all the work.</p>

<p>Also, try to put a little 'bounce' or hip movement into your walk. Not only does it look sexy, it also makes sure you use your whole body in a healthy way when walking.</p>

<h5>Carrying things</h5>

<p>Standing in correct posture makes it harder to reach things you could reach by moving your shoulder forward or curving your back. But, there are simple alternatives: stand closer to the object, and make your <strong>legs </strong>do all the work.</p>

<p>When you're carrying something, keep it as close to your body as you can. This makes lifting easier.</p>

<h5>Sleeping</h5>

<p>Don't sleep on your stomach. Sleep on your back.</p>

<p>If you like sleeping on your side, stick a small pillow between your knees to even then keep the body symmetrical.</p>

<p>Also, make sure you either have a very deformable pillow or one that's flat and precisely the distance between your shoulder and neck. Most pillows are just a big sort-of-rectangle, sort-of-ball of softness. While it is indeed very soft, your neck is not straight when using those, and they are often not high enough to support your shoulder width.</p>

<h2>For the lovers, here's all benefits in a nice list</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Improved organ function:</strong> When you're standing up straight, you're giving your organs all the space they need to work well. If you don't, your rib cage will start to push against the organs and that they do not like.</li>
	<li><strong>Improved flow of blood and signals from the brain:</strong>  As said before, your back makes sure all signals from the brain go to everywhere in the body. When you have a lot of tension in the back, a lot of these signals might be lost as there's some sort of block before they go to the rest of the body. This results in your body not knowing where to grow muscle, where to send blood to, what and how to develop, etc. Also, I myself had a problem with my left shoulder being a bit out of place and tensed up for a few years, and had serious problems with my heart as a result of the things pushing it out of place and cutting of the blood flow.</li>
	<li><strong>Reduced tension:</strong>  Simple, if everything is in the correct place, there's no need for tension.</li>
	<li><strong>Increased cognitive performance:</strong>  Studies have shown that people who slouch are more (easily) depressed than others, which is mostly a result of the fact that they don't have good concentration and sometimes can't think clearly. This can all be solved by correcting your posture!</li>
	<li><strong>Increased height:  </strong>Studies have also shown that, for some reason, taller men are liked better. On the other hand, there seems to be a lot of people negative about tall women, but I personally don't see the problem with that at all. And it's not like people can do that much about their length.</li>
	<li><strong>Prevents humped shoulders, beer bellies and other not-so-great stuff:</strong>  When you're young, you're flexible enough to adapt and still look great. But, once you get older a lot of complications come into play, and these can all (for a part) be solved by having correct posture.</li>
	<li><strong>Increased confidence:</strong>  Somehow related to the 'increased height', standing up straight, looking forward (not down), gives a confident look and will actually make you feel confident.</li>
</ul>

  title: "[Fitness/Health] Good Sleeping Practices"
  post: "<p>It's common knowledge that sleeping is good for your health. But how many hours should you sleep every night? What should we do before we go to bed, and after we wake up? Why exactly is it good for you? I'll try to answer these questions as well as I can.</p> 

<p>But I have to add, even scientists are still not completely sure why we sleep, how it works and what exactly happens. I only provide the information that has been tested and results in feeling more rested for everyone.</p>

<h2>How much should I sleep?</h2>

<p>That depends on your age, and a bit on your DNA. Some people needs lots of sleep, some don't---there is nothing you can do about that. But here is a list of the average sleeping hours per age category:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Newborns</strong> (0-2 months): 12---18 hours</li>
	<li><strong>Infants </strong>(3-11 months): 14---15 hours</li>
	<li><strong>Toddlers </strong>(1-3 years): 12---14 hours</li>
	<li><strong>Preschoolers </strong>(3-5 years): 11---13 hours</li>
	<li><strong>School-age children</strong> (5-10 years): 10---11 hours</li>
	<li><strong>Teens </strong>(10-17) years: 8---9.5 hours</li>
	<li><strong>Adults: </strong>7-9 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>You will notice that the amount of sleep you need becomes less and less as you age. But still, around 8 hours of sleep is an amount that many people almost never reach. As you are most likely to be in one of the last two categories, the absolute minimum amount of sleep you should get Is <strong>7 hours</strong>.</p>

<h2>But that's impossible?!</h2>

<p>Let's see about that. You probably want at least an hour to get stuff done in the morning, and at night you also want at least an hour of spare time. Then wouldn't sleeping from <strong>12 pm</strong>---<strong>7 am</strong> be a nice fit? You get your hours of sleep, and you get enough time for fun stuff.</p>

<h2>Still, can't do it.</h2>

<p>But then you might say: I don't immediately fall asleep as soon as I lie down, and I don't wake up at the same time every day.</p>

<p>That is true for most people, and it has a lot to do with what sleeping actually is.</p>

<p>We fall asleep when we're tired, relaxed and our eyes haven't had stimuli for some time. I will provide you with a few tips and tricks in a few paragraphs about how you can make sure that happens and trick your body into sleeping earlier.</p>

<p>We wake up when our body feels rested enough or there's lots of light in the room. Waking up naturally is always better than by alarm clock, but because it is very much unpredictable, most people have to use one. If you want to know, I explain a bit about the theory or science behind sleeping at the end.</p>

<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Schedule.</strong> Most important of all, is having a sleeping rhythm. Sometimes life gets crazy and you cannot afford sleeping late, or going to bed early. Most people solve this by sleeping more than usual on the days they have some free time. While this system of catching up with your sleeping amount is always better than becoming sleep deprived, it is not the best way to do it. If you make sure that you go to bed a quarter to 12 <em>every evening</em> and put an alarm clock around a quarter to 7 <em>every morning<strong>, </strong></em>you will soon enough get into a rhythm. And your body likes that.

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><strong>Why?</strong> Because your body knows that it has those 7 hours to get everything done it wants to do. It knows when to shut down the body and fall asleep, and when it will be woken up. It smooths out these two processes and makes them faster, but also learns to use the time in between most efficiently.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Rest before going to bed.</strong> If you want to fall asleep within 10-15 minutes of going to bed, you need to make sure your body is rested and doesn't want to do anything anymore. This means to <strong>stop eating or drinking</strong> anything <strong>2 hours</strong> before you go to bed, don't exercise an <strong>hour</strong> before going to bed, and of course don't do other crazy stuff (drinking alcohol or caffeine-filled products for example).</li>
	<li><strong>Have a nice place to sleep.</strong> Make sure your bed is clean, make sure the temperature is okay (a bit below room temperature), make sure there's no light at night. If you can, do try to have lots of sunshine in the morning, as that is the most natural and healthy way to wake up. Also keep in mind the things you learned in the <em>correct posture</em> article about sleeping without hurting your body.</li>
	<li><strong>Don't worry.</strong> Everybody in this world goes to bed and starts to think about what they did wrong today, what they will have to do tomorrow, etcetera---don't. This seems healthy to most problems, as you are mostly solving problems and thinking deeply about subjects. But because you are so darn active, it is almost impossible to fall asleep. Your brain actually solves problems you've thought about before while you sleep, so its best you don't postpone it. If you are awake and actively thinking about problems, most people have the tendency to mostly worry and not actually try to solve or think positively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Science of Sleeping</h2>

<p>Sleeping has at its core a single purpose: shut down everything we don't need, so that we can regrow our body. When you sleep, your muscles grow, your energy reserve refills, any wounds are healed and harmful viruses dealt with. But, the most important part is in your brain.</p>

<p>Your brain uses sleep to put all sorts of things you've learned, seen and experienced that day into the long-term memory. It tries to build strong connections between what you already had and what you did that day. Not sleeping enough therefore causes memory loss, depression, problems with focussing---a whole array of mental problems, on top of the physical ones.</p>

<p>There are basically two stages your body alternates between when you sleep. There is the <strong>REM sleep</strong> most people know (Rapid Eye Movement, or otherwise called <strong>light sleep</strong>), and a stage which we'll call <strong>deep sleep </strong>or non-REM sleep.</p>

<p>The first REM sleep stage lasts about 10 minutes, but they get longer and longer after that (the final one usually lasts an hour). Your eyelids move rapidly, you breathe faster and heart rate rises. This is the stage where your brain is most active, and <strong>dreams</strong> are made here.</p>

<p>The non-REM sleep lasts anywhere between 5 to 15 minutes. It has three stages:</p>

<ol>
	<li>You're not really sleeping. Your eyes are closed, but it is very easy to wake you up.</li>
	<li>Your heart rate slows and body temperature drops. This is basically preparation for deep sleep, and REM sleep.</li>
	<li>Deep sleep. It is very hard to wake you up, and if you wake up you feel weak, disoriented and maybe even sick.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your body typically tries to wake up during stage 1 of non-REM sleep. You should see it like this: you close your eyes and tell your body it is fine to go to sleep. Your body prepares REM sleep, performs the REM stage, and then performs a check 'can I wake up?' If there's still work to be done or it's still dark, it will continue this cycle.</p>

<p>Using an alarm clock therefore increases your chances of waking up at the wrong time. If you wake up from your alarm clock and you can barely open your eyes, you've disturbed REM sleep. If you wake up, and you feel even worse than you did before you went to bed---you've cut your deep sleep. Therefore, getting in a rhythm so that your body knows when to stop doing stuff and wake up is a very wise thing to do.</p>

  title: "[Fitness/Health] Eat & Drink Healthy (Part 1)"
  post: "<p>Supplying yourself with enough water and nutrients every day is the most important part in being healthy, by a long margin. Eating the right products at the right time increases how you look, feel and function. Eating the wrong products, or not eating much at all is, dramatically speaking, the same as slowly killing yourself.</p> 

<p>Your body is continuously burning through its reserves to keep your heart beating, lungs going and brain functioning. It therefore needs the right product, in the right amount at the right time. Now this sounds like it's an exact science, but it isn't. I will explain to you in this article the basic fundamentals and rules from which you need to make your decision, but no exact portions or anything like that are given. That depends on your body, and you should feel when it is too little or too much.</p>

<h2>Some genetics</h2>

<p>Everyone has a different body. This means that there is a different rate at which nutrients are processed, but also a different ratio on how much is stored as fat, used to grow muscles or used for energy. There are roughly speaking two types we can distinguish here:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>The forever lean.</strong> There are lots of people who are skinny, and just can't do anything about it. Everything they eat is immediately converted into energy, controlling body temperature, brain function, etcetera. These people can eat whatever they want without accumulating fat, but it is very hard to grow any muscle.</li>
	<li><strong>The powerful plump.</strong> On the other hand, for a lot of people it is almost impossible to lose weight. Everything they eat is almost immediately stored as fat, if not used for growing muscles. These people therefore need to really closely watch what they eat, but a lot of what they eat is put into a more muscular body---that's their advantage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most people sit somewhere between these two categories, but for both this still rings true: the amount you eat is not as important as <strong>what you eat</strong>. The skinny ones can eat whatever they like and stay skinny, but if they only eat fast foods they are still going to be unhealthy and running the risk of heart disease.</p>

<p>You probably know what I am talking about and have come to terms with whatever type you are. It is important to know that and keep in mind, but know that it is not impossible for skinny people to grow muscle and plump people to be lean and fit if you work hard enough.</p>

<h2>How much should I weigh?</h2>

<p>Before we can discuss what you need to do to get to ideal weight, we need to determine <em>what is the ideal weight?</em></p>

<p>Well, it depends. On your age, length and overall body shape.</p>

<p>The best way to check it is therefore simply looking in the mirror. Stand straight, and check if there is a very noticeable amount of fat on your belly. If it is only slightly noticeable, you're fine. And most below that is also okay, but if you start to see bones through your skin or get a six-pack without ever having trained your abs---you're eating far too little.</p>

<p>However, as this still might seem vague, there is something called the <strong>BMI</strong> (Body Mass Index) which you can calculate for yourself. It works like this:</p>

> BMI = weight / (height * height)

<p>With weight in <em>kilograms</em> and height in <em>meters</em>. Then your result gives you an indication:</p>

<ul>
	<li>BMI < <strong>18.5</strong>: People with this are <em>underweight</em>.</li>
	<li>18.5 < BMI < <strong>25:</strong> You have the ideal body weight!</li>
	<li>25 < BMI <<strong> 30</strong>: People with this are <em>overweight</em>.</li>
	<li>BMI > <strong>30</strong>: People with this suffer from <em>obesity.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Now this test is quite accurate and in most cases true, except for <strong>trained athletes</strong>. A square inch of muscle is heavier than a square inch of fat, so if you have very well-grown muscles, you will most likely be classified as overweight, and in very rare cases as obese. In that case you shall have to decide for yourself!</p>

<p><strong>Body Fat</strong></p>

<p>One last thing before we can continue, and it is about body fat. Body fat is usually given in percentages---the percentage of your body that is fat. I'll give you a little overview of the percentages (for women and men respectively):</p>

<table>
	<tr><td></td><td>Women</td><td>Men</td>
	<tr><td>Essential fat.</td><td> 10---13%. </td><td> 2---5% </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Athletes.</td><td> 14---20% </td><td> 6---13% </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Fitness.</td><td> 21---24% </td><td> 14---17% </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Average.</td><td> 25---31% </td><td> 18---24% </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Obese.</td><td> Over 32% </td><td> Over 25%.</li>
</table>

<p>Now, what does this tell you? That a certain amount of fat is required. Without that essential fat, you would look very bad and most probably die very soon. Fat is good, if you have it in small amounts. You can see that the average person has quite a lot of it, and that if you for example only have 18%, you are doing very well. So don't try too hard to remove all fat, it's better to look fit and healthy than as if you haven't eaten in weeks.</p>

<p><em>How do I measure body fat? </em>It is not really (easily) measurable using some sort of formula, so I suggest you look up pictures for the percentages and see with which one you can compare yourself.</p>

<h2>Eating at the right times</h2>

<p><em>When</em> you consume your food (and drinks), is equally as important as <em>what</em> you eat. If you wake up in the morning, your body has been doing a lot but you haven't eaten for let's say 8 or 9 hours. You can eat as healthy as you like, if you skip the breakfast you will still feel like you're lacking energy. Therefore, these tips are useful to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Eat at least <strong>3 big meals</strong> every day: one in the morning (breakfast), afternoon (lunch) and evening (dinner)

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>This should provide you with basic nutrition to get through the whole day.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Eat small, lightweight meals (snacks) throughout the day
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Do this to make sure your metabolism keeps working at speed and prevent you from overeating yourself at one of the 3 big meals. It also provides a little burst of energy and stills your hunger a bit.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Drink water</strong> before, during and after any meal. If you just drink water regularly through the day, that is fine as well.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Water is <em>extremely</em> essential for your body. It makes sure all waste products are removed, it is crucial for building anything in your body, performing core functions, keeps your blood pressure at a good level and keeps your stomach going (read: it prevents stomach aches).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Make your <strong>breakfast</strong> the healthiest and largest meal of your day, and certainly don't skip it!
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>There are two things crucial to how you feel on a day: how well you slept and your breakfast. Breakfast is supposed to get your body started again and provide you with enough energy to properly wake up. If you don't eat breakfast, eat too quick or the wrong things, there's a great chance you just ruined the rest of your day. Include at least <em>grains</em> (brown bread, cereal) and <em>fruit</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Don't eat big meals after dinner, especially if you're not going to exercise anymore.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>When you sleep, and I mean really deep sleep, you don't process food anymore. Therefore, if you eat anything less than 2 hours before going to bed, your body will try to process it before you can fall asleep. This causes you to lie awake in bed, not being able to fall asleep---but it also tries to speed up the process and stores much more of your food as fat, and not as something useful.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Eating the right foods</h2>

<p>As a kid, you were probably told to adhere to the <em>Healthy Eating Pyramid</em>. You hated it, but sadly enough, all the wisdom it claims to possess is true. The pyramid shows everything we need, and how much we need it in relation to each other. It doesn't specify exact portions, but rather the ratio between all the different products.</p>

<p><img src="media/HealthyEatingPyramid.png" /></p>

<p>I will talk you through the different components from the bottom to the top:</p>

<p>The foundation of all health and healthy weight comes from <strong>daily exercise &amp; weight control</strong>. Exercising daily makes sure everything you eat is used and not stored as fat, while regular weight control is the only way to really check where your weight is going.</p>

<p>Then the first layer consists of the following trio:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Whole Grains: </strong>mainly used for their <em>carbohydrates</em>, which proved us with energy. Every big meal should have a foundation based upon these types of foods.

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Examples: oatmeal, whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, brown rice.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Vegetables &amp; Fruits:</strong> they contain the necessary vitamins and nutrients to help build your body and keep it functioning properly. Should be eaten as much as whole grains, which means including them as well with every big meal.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Examples: all of them are good, but among the best are: mango, pomegranate, guava, raspberries, orange, avocado (fruits) and kale, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, artichoke, bell pepper, spinach (veggies)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Healthy fats/oils</strong>: should be eaten a bit less than the previous two, but still form a very important part. We've already established that the body needs some fat, and then healthy fats are of course much better than the other ones. They are usually only included with dinner, which means you should make them a big part of that meal.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Examples: olive, canola, soy, corn, sunflower, peanut, other vegetable oils &amp; trans-free margarine.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The second layer has these two on it:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Nuts, Seeds, Beans &amp; Tofu: </strong>these are also full of vitamins, minerals, protein and fiber. They could be called the <em>plant foods</em>, and more and more research is showing how important they are for the body.

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Examples: black beans, navy beans, garbanzos, lentils, almonds, walnuts, pecans, peanuts, hazelnuts, pistachios.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Fish, Poultry &amp; Eggs: </strong>fish is recommended by everyone in the food industry because they contain <em>omega-3 fats</em> which are amazing for your body and brain. Poultry and eggs usually contain lots of protein together with only a low amount of saturated fat or cholesterol.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Examples: chicken, turkey, and well, eh, fish and eggs.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to always have a reasonable amount of one of these groups with every big meal.</p>

<p>The third layer has only one thing on it:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Dairy </strong>or <strong>Vitamin D/Calcium Supplements: </strong>These should be limited to 1---2 servings per day. In the old days, everybody was told to drink as much milk as they can. Now, however, it seems to be the case that it does have some positive effects, but as you grow older you don't really need most of it anymore. Recommended for children, adults should restrain from more servings per day.

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Examples: milk, cheese, yoghurt, cottage cheese</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>And then, floating on top of the pyramid in a small rectangle. These should all be <strong>used sparingly</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Red/Processed Meat &amp; Butter: </strong>They contain lots of saturated fats. Most of the nutrients they contain can also be received from products that are lower in the pyramid and much healthier

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Examples: beef, pork, bacon, hot dogs</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Salt:</strong> salt plays a very important role in our body---it keeps all fluids in our system balanced. It is therefore closely regulated by ourselves, and if you eat too much salt you will upset this system, leading to all sorts of complications. Salt is sprinkled on top of everything these days so you can't avoid it, but try to pick only foods with low <em>sodium values</em>.</li>
	<li><strong>Refined Grains, Sugary Drinks/Sweets, Potatoes:</strong> The so-called <em>refined</em> grains are altered whole grains, and altered in such a way that the good stuff is removed and replaced with bad stuff that tastes better. Together with sugary products and potatoes they create fast and wild fluctuations in blood sugar, which usually leads to weight gain, diabetes or heart failure.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Examples: white bread, white rice, white pasta</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Then there is a last layer that is outside the pyramid, because it contains optional things that can sometimes do a lot of good, and sometimes do a lot of harm. It's these two I'm talking about:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Multivitamin:</strong> most people don't get enough of that from their regular daily eating habits, so using this creates a sort of nutritional backup. It should however never replace healthy eating, and is not enough to make up for unhealthy eating</li>
	<li><strong>Alcohol:</strong> you should refrain from it as much as you can. But, studies have shown that one glass of wine a day actually has lots of benefits---including lowering the risk of heart disease.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In conclusion, </strong>stay away from these things: <strong>processed food</strong>, <strong>refined grains</strong> and <strong>sugary products </strong>(choose unrefined sugars or the needed nutrients from other products instead).</p>

<h2>Eating the right way</h2>

<p>You might think 'eh, well, I think I already know how to eat. I have been doing it my whole life'. That is true, but there are still some improvements to be made to how long and in what way you should eat. And all of this has to do with the <strong>hunger signal</strong>.</p>

<p>When you get the hunger signal ('hmm, I feel a bit hungry'), you should immediately find something to eat. If you hold on to some sort of eating schedule every day, that signal will usually come at the right time. If you don't, or can't for some reason, you should also have some food with you or near you.</p>

<p>Because, if you don't start eating soon, there's two things that will happen. First of all, because your body is saying it is running out of resources---it will start malfunctioning if you don't provide them. Second of all, the moment you see food again you'll be inclined to eat very fast (because you're so hungry). And eating fast isn't good.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> Multiple reasons. It takes around 20 minutes for your brain to get the signal it's not hungry anymore. If you eat fast, you always eat more than you really need, because during those 20 minutes you will have eaten much more than you'd usually do. On top of that, eating fast means you're chewing and processing your food less than usually. This means that not all the good things inside can be absorbed by the body, and half of the food is wasted.</p>

<p>Therefore, to eat healthy, you need to <strong>eat slower</strong>. You need to <strong>chew more</strong>, <strong>drink lots of water</strong> and talk with family members or colleagues <strong>between bites</strong>. This ensures you focus on what you are eating, and gives your body time to wait for the 'I am full' signal.</p>

<p>Also, don't eat while watching TV, a movie or doing some other distracting activity. I know, it is nice to have some snacks when watching that awesome blockbuster, and that is perfectly fine. But don't eat whole meals in front of the telly.</p>

<h2>Growing Muscle</h2>

<p>Eating healthy ensures you stay at a healthy weight, and get the right nutrients to stay alive. But, if you do a lot of exercise and want to <strong>grow muscles</strong>, you need to <strong>eat more</strong>!</p>

<p>There are three things that are important if you want to do this: <strong>proteins</strong> (dairy products), <strong>carbohydrates</strong> (pasta, cereal, grains) or <strong>healthy fats </strong>(nuts, beans, soy, oil, fish).</p>

<p>Proteins are the building blocks for muscle. The body wants to use them for that specific task, but if there is no muscle to grow, it is quick to store it as fat. So only eat this a lot, if you are going to exercise a lot.</p>

<p>Carbohydrates are important whether you exercise or not, but you might want to increase a bit on these too. They give you energy that is needed for the exercises and controlling muscle growth. However, these are even more likely than proteins to be stored as fat, so watch out.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is recommended you don't up your carbohydrates dosage, but draw your energy from the healthy fats.</p>

<p>Proteins are by far the most important. Here's a good rule of thumb:</p>

> Body weight (in <em>pounds</em>) x 1.5 = amount of proteins to eat (in <em>grams</em>)

<p>And still, make <em>breakfast</em> extremely important if you exercise daily. Drink lots of water and always eat a bit <strong>after</strong> your workout. Right before usually gives you stomach aches, and exercising actually puts a stop to your food system, so products eaten before a workout are not processed well.</p>

  title: "[Fitness/Health] Exercise & Fitness"
  post: "<p>We've discussed everything there is to know about healthy eating, but we also mentioned that only 50% of a healthy and good-looking body comes from the food. The other 50% comes from staying active, all day every day. But, it's easy to just say 'stay active', so I'll be explaining what I mean by that.</p> 

<p>Leading an active lifestyle has numerous advantages. It ensures you don't store excess fat, that you are strong, and that you can live every day without tiring too fast. Which brings us to our first key point:</p>

<p><strong>What is being fit?</strong> Being fit doesn't mean you have muscles popping out all over the place. It doesn't mean being able to kick a soccer ball 50 yards. It doesn't mean being able to casually ride a bicycle for two hours. While it takes practice and effort to accomplish these things, being fit is all about a combination of three things.</p>

<h2>The 3 Types of Exercise</h2>

<p>There are three main aspects of your body that you can and should train. If you are training for a particular sport or goal you might want to focus on one and leave the others behind a little, but if you just want to be fit enough to feel energized throughout the whole day, you'll need to get a bit of all three.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Stamina.</strong> How long you're able to stay active. It mainly corresponds with your lung capacity, which grows if you use it more, and shrinks if you don't. But, it also has to do with being able to keep a low and steady heart rate, and how long your muscles can survive lots of stress.</li>
	<li><strong>Power.</strong> Refers to how strong your muscles are---pure strength. If you are stronger, you can run faster, push harder, swing faster, kick faster, carry more weight, etcetera. Stronger does not only refer to how <em>large </em>your muscle mass is (as very skinny people can be extremely strong), but also how well they are trained to <em>contract</em>.</li>
	<li><strong>Technique.</strong> Is about your coordination and ability to let your muscles do exactly what you want. It's about reflexes, visual-spatial abilities, hand-eye coordination, being able to estimate where something will end up or how fast you have to kick something. Some of these are only useful in (specific) sports, but even pouring milk in a glass or cycling has to do with lots of technique.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you start doing serious exercises, it is very important to have <strong>correct posture</strong> and <strong>healthy eating practices</strong>. If you don't, there's a good chance you will only hurt yourself, overstretch something or lose power instead of gaining it.</p>

<h2>The Required Training</h2>

<p>I will now give you some idea about how you can train every one of these things individually. While most exercises work for all three areas, there's always one or two it targets more.</p>

<h5>Stamina</h5>

<p>The most important one. If you can't exercise for longer than a few minutes, you can't train the other two aspects of fitness. Stamina has to do with the health of your whole body, and should therefore be your basic activity for any day. If you don't have time or motivation to do anything else, at least make sure you do one of these. Stamina is not something you keep once you have it: if you stop exercising for one or two weeks, it will drop and you have to work your way up again.</p>

<p>Typical exercises are <strong>walking, cycling, running, trampoline jumping, skipping (rope)</strong>.</p>

<p>Exercises that require more muscle and technique, but still target stamina a lot are <strong>dancing, swimming, climbing</strong> and even <strong>singing</strong>.</p>

<p>These sports are usually done for a very long time, and are really about doing them until you have reached your stamina limit. When you reach that point, keep going for a few minutes to actually increase your stamina. If you stop right there, you will forever keep that limit.</p>

<p>There's also a group of exercises that very specifically trains stamina and your whole body (even muscles you didn't know existed), which are usually called <strong>aerobics</strong> or <strong>cardio</strong> (mostly associated with <strong>yoga</strong> or <strong>Pilates</strong>). However, the key point of these are often to achieve <em>mental awareness</em>, so you might want to think twice before signing up for some lessons on these. <strong>Cardio</strong> is usually done by people who want to lose weight and become fit overall.</p>

<p>Here are some last tips and tricks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you think stamina exercises are boring, you should do something I call <strong>whole body sports</strong>. These are sports that require your whole body to work simultaneously, all the time.

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Examples: soccer, hockey, basketball.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you can't go out and do something, there are some basic indoor exercises you can do.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Examples: just walking around the house, jogging in place, going up and down the stairs</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Step Exercises:</strong> take the first step of your stairs (or anything else you can step on), and go <em>up down up down </em>as fast as and for as long as you can. You can either do one leg at a time or both at the same time.</li>
	<li><strong>Jumping Jacks:</strong> what you basically do is jump between two positions. The first one is just standing straight, with legs nearly touching each other, arms straight down alongside your body. The second one is standing with legs widespread and arms high up in the air. Now jump between these two positions until you can't do it anymore.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Power</h5>

<p>If you have a basic stamina going, you can do muscle exercises. Before you start though, read the section on growing muscles in the <em>eat healthy (part 2)</em> article. While exercising, you actually break off a bit of muscle so that it can regrow stronger later (when you are resting). Therefore, if you don't eat enough, you are achieving the exact opposite of what you want!</p>

<p>What should happen with these exercises is that you should stop because your muscles can't take it anymore, and not because you are exhausted. If you reach your stamina limit before you reach your muscle limit, you are either doing the exercise wrong (too fast, usually) or need to increase your stamina.</p>

<p>These are what I like to call the <strong>core </strong>exercises, which train every muscle a bit and one half of the body a lot:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Push-ups: </strong>We all know them. Go lie down with your face pointing towards the ground, and push yourself up with your arms. Then when you are up (just before locking your elbows, never do that), start going down again---repeat. Make sure you keep your body perfectly straight (only touching the floor with tips of your toes and hands). If that is too difficult for you at the moment, there are some variations: keep your knees on the floor, move less with every push-up, put your hands closer to your body.</li>
	<li><strong>Pull-ups:</strong> even harder than push-ups, but that makes them even better. Seek some sort of bar that's just around as high as your arms can reach above your head. Grab it, pull yourself up, and after being at your highest point for a few seconds slowly let go---repeat. This trains everything except your legs.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>You can grab the bar in two ways: palms facing away from you, and facing towards you. The first one is harder (but also better), the second one easier.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Leg lifts:</strong> The one exercise that focuses on your legs, abs and lower back, and not upper body. Lay down on your back, and simply lift your legs up. It's important to lift them both at the same time, and keep them perfectly straight. The rest of your body must not change position and not help your legs. It's very hard, but very much worth it. If it becomes too easy, add heavy objects on top of your feet to lift with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to train more specifically, there's these exercises. Most people want to have amazing abs and gigantic arm muscles, and forget everything else. I think you know where I'm going: that's not the way to do it. Train your whole body, as everything is connected and needs each other to stay balanced. While a muscular upper body is something you can show off, if your legs can barely take the weight you're going to have lots of problems.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Crunches:</strong> Okay, one exercise for your abs. Lie down on your back, and move your upper body off the ground <em>only </em>by contracting your abs. Then slowly move downwards again---repeat. You don't have to move up all the way, only a tiny bit off the ground is enough.

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>There's some variations on this: you can have your legs flat on the ground or your knees bend, you can have hands behind your head or have them crossed over your upper body and touching the opposite shoulder.</li>
		<li>There is some word of warning here though: when done incorrectly, these can create a lot of <strong>back injuries</strong>. From my experience, having a correct posture all the time and doing whole body sports/stamina exercises already asks a lot from your abs, and should be enough to make them quite strong.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Squats:</strong> For your legs (and equilibrium), and a bit for back/shoulders/arms. Stand straight, just like with the jumping jacks, and then just bend your knees until your upper body is as low as you can hold, then slowly move up again---repeat. While going down, extend your arms forward until they form a 90 degree angle with your upper body. At first it might be hard not to fall, but you'll quickly get over this.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight Lifting:</strong> It really depends with which muscle(s) you lift the weight, but I'm going to explain the most basic exercise you can do with any weight (but <strong>dumbbells</strong> are still preferred if you have the money). Take the object in your hand, and simply <em>slowly</em> move it up and down in front of you. This trains almost everything on that side of the upper body.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Technique</h5>

<p>This comes into play mostly when you're doing sports. But, it is also very useful for your daily life, as good coordination and reflexes makes it easier for you to do any daily tasks fast and without mistakes. Catch things when you drop them or somebody throws something at you, walk around the house without stubbing your toe against every piece of furniture, etcetera.</p>

<p>Technique is trained with everything you do---it's all about practice, which comes in the form of sport. Good soccer players have great kicking technique, hockey players great swinging technique. Any sportsman needs great technique to excel in their area.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is often said that technique is more useful than power. Training for technique should be the first thing you do with a new sport, and not power. The only problem is that it can really only be trained by practicing one or multiple sports for a certain period of time.</p>

<p>You can become a member of a sports community in your neighbourhood, or buy yourself a table tennis table, or practice in a large backyard or playing field nearby (if you are lucky enough to have one of those).</p>

<h2>What to do Now</h2>

<p>Train all three areas! But, don't rush into it, and don't do things you know are too difficult for you right now. Injuries can take a lot of time to heal and make it impossible for you to train.</p>

<p>Also, you might train hard for 10 years, but if you one day just stop being active and eating healthy, you will very quickly lose your progress. The body is a living thing that is constantly using all its resources, and trying to regrow stronger. You only remain fit as long as you stay active every day. Even doing a little can change a lot.</p>

> I must note, though, that studies have shown that people who used to be very muscular or athletic, are able to grow and train their way back into that state much quicker and easier than people who've never been that fit before. So not <em>all</em> progress is lost.

<p>Secondly, significant results don't come fast. Start simple and small---doing only a few repetitions of an exercise, playing some slow table tennis or walking around your house for 10 minutes can be a good start. Over time, which can be a few weeks to months, you'll be able to easily do many repetitions, or run very fast for half an hour. Be patient, but be active every day.</p>

  title: "Complete Guide to Colour Theory"
  post: "<p>Colour is everywhere. Whatever you make, it is going to have a colour. Websites, newspapers, magazines, movies---they are all in their most primitive form a collection of colours.</p> 

<p>Lots of people say that black and white aren't colours, but this isn't exactly true. The arguments for that statement could be that black is the absence of colour, and that white is what a page looks like If you don't put any colour on it.</p>

<p>Even though there is some truth to that, black and white (and greys) still play a huge role in general colour theory. And that is what this course is about.</p>

<p>This course will walk you through the different colours this world is made out of, how you combine those to create harmonies, and what emotional reactions different colours evoke.</p>

<p>You can then use this information for all your further projects, either to easily find a good-looking colour scheme or use colours to really make your design's message stand out.</p>

  title: "[Colour Theory] Formats & Definitions"
  post: "<p>What actually <em>is</em> colour?</p>

<p>I'm not trying to start a philosophical rambling here, but just want to let you stop and think for a minute. It's important to know what colours are, how they are formed and how we interpret them. If you are aware of this basic theory, it is easier for you to identify colours, predict their effect and match them with each other. I'll not go into great detail, because this is only a beginners guide.</p> 

<h2>Light Waves</h2>

<p><img src="media/VisibleLightSpectrum.png" /></p>

<p>Colours are light waves. Well, it is a <em>property </em>of light - there are light waves we can't see, like UV-rays from the sun. The colour of a light wave is determined by its <strong>wavelength</strong>, and visible light is everything within a range of 400---700 nanometres. At the top of that range, light is red. At the bottom, light is violet. Above that 700, is the part that we call <strong>infrared </strong>(<em>under red</em>). If you go lower than 400, you'll find <strong>ultraviolet </strong>(<em>above violet</em>).</p>

<p>The names infrared and ultraviolet come from the fact that a higher wavelength, means a lower frequency, so frequency-wise infrared is 'below red' and ultraviolet 'above violet'.</p>

<p>As you can see, the ends of this spectrum are colours that are very close to each other, and that's why colours can be displayed in the famous <strong>colour wheel</strong>. That wheel is nothing more than the spectrum of visible light bend into a circle.</p>

<h2>The Eye</h2>

<p>Our eyes interpret light waves and send them to our brain, which makes us see all the colours in the world. There are two different types of receptors in there:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Rods</strong>. About 125 million of them. They can't see colours, but make us able to see the difference between shades and tones of lights. They enable us to walk in dark places, and adjust our eyes to bright sunlight. They recognize light and motion.</li>
	<li><strong>Cones</strong>. Only 7 million of them. They are divided into three groups, namely <strong>red, green </strong>and <strong>blue</strong>.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Colour blind people have one or two of these receptors malfunctioning.</li>
		<li>Fun fact: we don't really see that many colours. For example, the mantis shrimp has 16 colour receptors, so you could say that animal sees the world in 16 dimensional colour.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><em>But, I see more colours than just red, green and blue! </em>Yes, these cones work together to blend the three different main colours. Combining that with our enormous amount of rods makes us able to see roughly <strong>10 million colours</strong>. Although, everybody perceives colour a little differently due to differences in our eyes and brains.</p>

<p>To create order out of this chaos, numerous formats and definitions were invented for working with colour.</p>

<h2>Formats</h2>

<p>There are a few main formats, each being preferred in a different industry. However, most software has support for all of these and they are used interchangeably by everyone, so I recommend learning all of them and picking your own favourite.</p>

<p><img src="media/ColourTheoryFormats.png" />

<ul>
	<li><strong>RGB.</strong> Represents a colour by setting a value for the <em>red, green</em> and <em>blue </em>channels respectively. These values can range from 0 to 255.

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Examples: Red is <code>rgb(255,0,0)</code>, pink is <code>rgb(255,0,255)</code>, grey is <code>rgb(127,127,127)</code></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>HEX.</strong> Also sets values for <em>red, green </em>and <em>blue</em>. But, it uses hexagonal notation, which means a 16-base number system. This means nothing else than that the letters <strong>A---F</strong> are used for the numbers 10---16. This way, <strong>FF</strong> is 255.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Examples: Red is <code>#FF0000</code>, pink is <code>#FF00FF</code>, grey is <code>#787878</code></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>HSL/HSB. </strong>An alternative that is more intuitive, and is popular among graphic designers. It sets the three components <em>hue, saturation</em> and <em>light/brightness</em>. I will go into greater detail on this topic later on.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Examples: Red is <code>hsl(0,100%,50%)</code>, pink is <code>hsl(300,100%,50%)</code>, grey is <code>hsl(0, 0%, 50%)</code></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The first and last notation also sometimes have an <strong>alpha</strong> component attached to them (which makes them <em>rgba</em> and <em>hsla</em>). This does nothing to the colour itself, but sets the opacity of the text/object it is used on. This means that the final colour will be a mix of the pure colour and the colours of the elements underneath it. It is used very often as an easy way to blend multiple colours. However, if possible, try to avoid setting an alpha (which means omitting it or setting alpha to 1) and create all colours by picking them out yourself. This gives more control and usually looks better.</p>

<p><img src="media/ColourTheoryAlphaChannel.png" /></p>

<p>Also, this doesn't mean that you should throw all <strong>colour names</strong> overboard. It is still useful to know at least the basic colour names (red, blue, pink, purple, orange, brown, etc.) and some of the advanced ones (maroon, olive, lime, navy, aqua, fuchsia, etc.).</p>

<p><em>Why?</em> Say you're working on a project for a client. He is not going to say 'give that colour some more saturation'. He will be saying 'I want that link to be more orangy', 'a beige-like background would be great' or the even more vague 'could you make it look more nature-like and sunny?' You will need to know what they mean or are trying to say.</p>

<h2>The LAB Model</h2>
<p>On top of the colour models I've already mentioned, there's the LAB model. It isn't as intuitive or useful as the others, but it aims to solve one big problem.</p>

<p>This problem is the simple fact that colours have an inherent brightness. Red and yellow appear brighter than green or blue, even when you set it to the same level within the HSL model. Therefore, when you're trying to pick colours with the same level of lightness, you might accidentally get colours with lots of different levels of lightness.</p>

<p>The LAB model solves this deficiency by keeping the perceived lightness of a colour constant, which allows you to easily pick colours with identical brightness, and use colours across different media types. The first parameter stands for <strong>lightness</strong>, which you can set to a value between 0% (black) and 100% (white). The other two parameters, simply called <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, represent all colours. The first is a slider ranging from green (<em>-a</em>) to magenta (<em>+a</em>), while the second is a slider ranging from blue (<em>-b</em>) to yellow (<em>+b</em>).</p>

<p><img src="media/ColourTheoryLabModel.png"></p>

<p>This model is often present in software applications, such as Photoshop, as it allows you to pick colours that remain constant across different screen and media types. More about that will be discussed later.</p>

  title: "[Colour Theory] RGB, CMYK & Pantone"
  post: "<p>The three words from the title are very important to remember: they represent the three main colouring systems in the world. Without you knowing it, software you work in, ink you bought or the dye you're painting with works inside one of these systems. There is no good or bad here---each of them has its own purpose and strong area.</p> 

<p><img src="media/RGBvsCMYKvsPANTONE.png" /></p>

<h2>RGB</h2>

<p>As seen earlier, the letters represent <strong>red, green</strong> and <strong>blue</strong>. These are, strictly speaking, the only colours our eyes can see, so it's only logical that people based a system on this. For lots of people, this is still the colour system they use for websites or designing layouts/magazines/artwork.</p>

<p>It is easy to find out how to make the basic colours with this system. Red, green and blue are very simple, but mixing those gets you yellow, magenta and cyan---which are already a bit harder to imagine for some people. Therefore, this system is useful if you use one of the RGB colours as the main colour for your project.</p>

<p>This system is <strong>additive</strong>, which means that putting red, green and blue on top of each other creates the magnificent colour <strong>white</strong>. It is therefore a system based on light---multiple colours on top of each other create lighter and lighter versions. This makes it good for computer <strong>screens</strong>, as they start with black and create colour by putting light behind pixels.</p>

<h2>CMYK</h2>

<p>Already mentioned earlier, the letters stand for <strong>cyan, magenta, yellow </strong>and <strong>black</strong>. Most software allows switching between RGB and CMYK, because CMYK is harder to use (for you and your computer), but it also adds extra possibilities.</p>

<p>The system is <strong>subtractive</strong>, which means that putting cyan, magenta and yellow on top of each other creates a solid <strong>black</strong>. It is therefore a system based on ink---you start with a blank, white, light paper, and adding colours makes it darker and darker. This makes it ideal for any <strong>printed media</strong>, as they start with a white paper and put their content on top of that.</p>

<p>You might think: <em>what does it matter which colours you choose as your base colour?</em> And you would have a point, because it's still possible to create the same set colours as with RGB. But, using different colours as your starting point, makes creating certain colours easier than others. CMYK is a colour system based on contrast and darkness, and it's therefore easy to create colours that can hold their own on a piece of paper. RGB on the other hand is easy to use for a colour scheme that can show off a screen's resolution.</p>

<h2>Pantone</h2>

<p>The Pantone system is actually a system for naming colours for international and interdisciplinary use. They have indexed all colours you'd ever want to use, and given it a name in the form of <strong>PMS <number></strong>. However, they didn't index all those 10 million colours, but rather a subset of 400 colours that look good within any design and on across different media types.</p>

<p>The colours are therefore less <em>pure</em>, but more <em>soft</em> or a blend of different colours. And that's the reason they are loved by lots of designers, because they allow you to create a very colourful composition without any colours clashing or the whole project becoming way too cluttered.</p>

<p>While you can do the same without the system, it is recommended you take a look at it. You'll be able to find beautiful colours you can match and use for your design.</p>

<h2>Are Black and White Colours?</h2>

<p>Knowing about these systems, we can try to answer this question.</p>

<p>In RGB, white is created by adding red, green and blue together, so <em>yes </em>it is a colour. In print, white is created by not putting any colour on a white page, so <em>no</em> it is the absence of colour.</p>

<p>In CMYK, black is created by adding cyan, magenta and yellow together, so <em>yes</em> it is a colour. In the real world, objects are black because they absorb all light and don't send out any light waves, so <em>no</em> black is the absence of colour.</p>

<p>As you can see, there is no real answer to the question. But, most importantly, it doesn't matter. Black and white are seen everywhere, and are just as much an important part of your colour scheme. Putting black text or white text on a certain background is quite a big decision, so I suggest you look at black and white as colours and treat them that way.</p>

<h2>Colour Usage in Different Media</h2>
<p>The reason we have all these different systems, is because there are lots of different types of media---such as paper, canvas, or computer screens---we can display colour on. The way they create and display a colour is different, which requires a different setup and which can lead to inconsistencies across platforms. For example, screens optically mix flecks of different light together when viewed from a distance, while printer’s inks are transparent and mixing occurs as colours show through each other.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter we already saw many different formats we can use to construct our colours, and I made it look as though they could all display the exact same colours, but that's not really true. All of them can display the same <em>number</em> of colours, but the <em>range</em> of colours (which specific ones they can actually create) is different. This range is what we call a <strong>colour space</strong> or spectrum.</p>

<p><img src="media/ColourTheoryGamuts.png" /></p>

<p>NOTE: Of course, there are many more colour spaces than these, but the ones I mentioned are the most common ones.</p>

<p>Luckily, we can use something called <strong>metamerism</strong> to solve all these problems. It's the property that, even though one colour space may differ from another, different colours may appear the same. So, what we need is a way to transform one colour space into another.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the colour capabilities of any colour capture or reproduction system is known as a <strong>gamut</strong>, and those gamuts give us a way to translate between colour systems. On the computer, they are described within <em>ICC profiles</em>, and any reasonably good graphical software should allow you to use them. Such a profile holds the range of colours within a colour space, its darkest and lightest tones, and how those colours are distributed (the distance between pairs of subsequent colours). I won't go into detail about how to use them, as it depends heavily on your software and project.</p>

<p>I will note, however, that it's often best to work on your design or photograph in an as large gamut as possible, and only change it to something more applicable when you output the final design.</p>"

  title: "[Colour Theory] Using the Colour Wheel"
  post: "<p>I present to you: the most overused graphic for teaching colour theory!</p>

<p>While it is very important in understanding the basic concepts, almost none of the designs you see in real-life adhere to the colour wheel rules perfectly. The colour wheel gives you a very useful graphical representation for the different rules and guidelines in colour theory,  but it only represents a very small set of pure colours, which are rarely---if ever---used in a design.</p> 

<p><img src="media/ColourWheel.png" /></p>

<h2>Primary, Secondary and Tertiary colours</h2>

<p>There are three layers or <em>levels</em> that can be distinguished in the colour wheel.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Primary: </strong>Red, yellow, blue.</li>
	<li><strong>Secondary: </strong>Orange, green, purple. Created by combining primary colours.</li>
	<li><strong>Tertiary:</strong> Intermediate colours, created by combining primary with secondary colours.</li>
</ul>

<p>While this is nice to know, it doesn't mean that one colour is more important than the other. All spokes of the colour wheel are their own equally important colour category which you can choose as the base of your colour scheme.</p>

<h2>Warm &amp; Cool Colours</h2>

<p>The colour wheel can be divided into two equal halves, each containing 6 consecutive colours. These halves then represent the <strong>warm</strong> and <strong>cool </strong>colours. This rough distinction is made to identify which colours bring energy, warmth and power to a design, and which colours make it look calm, relaxed and professional.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Warm:</strong> The colours from red to light green. Red and yellow are usually seen as bringing the most energy. Warm colours pop at you, giving the appearance of being closer. They feel hot and communicate a feeling of warmth.</li>
	<li><strong>Cool:</strong> The rest of the colours, from dark green to purple-pink. Blue is usually seen as the most calm one. Cool colours recede, giving the appearance of being farther away. They remind us of nature and water, and communicate a feeling of calmness.</li>
</ul>

<p>I must say, however, that context is very important here, and other properties play a role in communicating certain feelings as well. Next chapters will be about that.</p>

<p>NOTE: There is some debate as to whether green and purple/pink belong to warm or cool colours. The distinction I used above is the one I was taught, but I often use a pink or light-purple colour as a bright, warm colour. Bottom-line: don't follow these rules blindly, see for yourself.</p>

<h2>Neutral Colours</h2>

<p><img src="media/NeutralColours.png" /></p>

<p>Besides these colours with temperature, there's a group that is neither warm nor cool. They can be added to any colour combination, and their meaning or importance will change a lot depending on the colours around it. They often serve as backdrop, or body text colour, and shouldn't draw attention to themselves. They are the <strong>neutrals</strong>, which is further split into two categories:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Greyscale: </strong>Black, white and all the greys between it are neutral colours. Depending on how bright your colour is, you can add one or multiple of these to it. A dark blue can have white and light greys on it, while a light blue is better off with black or dark greys.

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Often times, the colours <em>tan </em>and <em>ivory</em> are also included here. They are a blend of grey with beige/brown, and look soft and dull. However, that makes them ideal for a subtle background colour.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Warm neutrals:</strong> These include all sorts of brown (even including some orange tints) and beige. They are called warm neutrals because they give off a warm, safe, cosy, natural feeling. Brown is basically a mix of all the colours, so it fits with everything while still having its own unique identity.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>I personally use warm neutrals a lot, because they add a sense of warmth and fullness to a design, while at the same time not interfering with the main colour scheme.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use the Colour Wheel</h2>

<p>Later on, when we start talking about harmonies and colour context you'll see the true importance of this wheel.</p>

<p>However, in explaining some of the core definitions for colours, it isn't all that useful. For that, we will use colour triangles in the next chapter.</p>

  title: "[Colour Theory] Understanding Colour Triangles"
  post: "<p>Colours are said to be three-dimensional. Therefore, the best way to display the spectrum of ( = all the possibilities of) one colour, is to use a triangle.</p> 

<p><img src="media/ColourTriangle.png" /></p>

<h2>Hue</h2>

<p>Hue = pure <strong>colour</strong>. Remember that spectrum of visible light we talked about? Well, the hue scale follows exactly that.</p>

<p>At 0&deg; you get the light with the lowest wavelength, which is <strong>red</strong>. At 360&deg; you get the light with the highest wavelength, which is <strong>violet</strong>. Setting a value in between those 0---360 degrees will get you one of the intermediate colours.</p>

<p>This property is the most absolute of the three properties. No matter the saturation or brightness, a red hue stays a red colour. Neutral colours, such as grey, are achieved when the hue is not (clearly) visible (due to the settings of the other two properties).</p>

<h2>Chroma / Saturation</h2>

<p>Chroma refers to the purity of a colour. It refers to how strong or weak a colour is. A colour with high saturation has no added black, white or grey. Low saturation means all the hue is gone and it has become black, white or grey. Usually, it's wise to stay around medium levels of saturation. As I already mentioned a few times, the point of greatest saturation is not the same for each colour; each has their own inherent basic level of lightness or darkness, which means the effects of low or high saturation aren't equally visible with every hue.</p>

<p>Desaturated colours are restrained and sombre, while saturated colours are vibrant, intense, exciting and dynamic. Saturated colours attract viewer’s attention, but you should use desaturated colours when function and efficiency of the design are the priority. Desaturated, light colours are seen as friendly, while desaturated, dark colours are seen as formal. Try not to combine highly saturated colours, as they can visually clash with one another.</p>

<p>A value for this is usually set in percentages, 0% to 100%.</p>

<h2>Value / Lightness / Brightness</h2>

<p>Refers to the light and dark properties of colours. Some colours naturally look brighter (<em>yellow</em>), while others naturally look darker (<em>violet</em>).</p>

<p>A low value colour is usually used for contrast and sometimes background, while colours with high values are used , for the most part, on top or next to each other, to create more aesthetically pleasing designs. Different degrees of value provides a sens of motionin a design, guiding the viewer's eye into, through, and around a visual composition. Additionally, because distant objects appear lighter in the real world, value can create the illusion of depth and space.</p>

<p>Brightness is usually set in percentages, 0% to 100%. Black has the lowest value of all colours, while white has the highest.</p>

<h2>Using this Knowledge</h2>

<p>Knowing this is great and helpful, but what exactly can you do with it? Well, it helps when creating a colour harmonies, colour schemes and understanding what happens when you put colours in a certain context.</p>

<p>While all these subjects are elaborated on in further chapters, there are still some basic definitions I need to explain here. These have to do with creating variations on a hue, either to get the exact colour you want or to create lighter and darker versions of your main colours.</p>

<h2>Shades</h2>

<p>Shades are darker versions of your hue. You get them by adding <strong>black</strong>---the more black you add, the darker the shade.</p>

<p>Shades are, as the name suggests, perfect for creating shadow effects. You can also use them as background colour, while the text is coloured in the pure hue. Shades seem to recede into the distance. Their general use, however, is to simulate black in a colourful manner, serving as a neutral.</p>

<h2>Tones</h2>

<p>Tones are slightly different versions of your hue, making the colour look <strong>duller</strong> or <strong>softer</strong>. They are created by adding <strong>grey</strong>---the more grey you add, the more the colour will fade and turn into actual grey.</p>

<p>Tones usually create a vintage, sophisticated or elegant feel, and are easy to use plenty of in designs because they are as neutral as colours get.</p>

<h2>Tints</h2>

<p>Tints are lighter versions of your hue. You get them by adding <strong>white </strong>---the more white you add, the lighter the shade.</p>

<p>They are usually used to create highlights, or to simulate white in a bit more colourful way and serve as a warm neutral. As opposed to shades, tints seem to pop out of the design, though in a weaker way than warm/cool colours provide this sensation of depth.</p>

  title: "[Colour Theory] Harmonies & Relationships"
  post: "<p>We've finally come to the fun and useful part: creating colour schemes. Using all the knowledge you've obtained from previous chapters, it should be easy to follow these rules (or guidelines) and apply them to your own project. We'll be using the colour wheel to represent certain ideas, but they work for every colour in every circumstance of course. Having said that, I want to remind you that the colour wheel is just a simplistic representation to help you learn about colour---it's best to use a graduated colour wheel with nearly all colours on it in real projects.</p> 

<h2>Harmonizing Basics</h2>

<p>There are a few unwritten rules about colour schemes, which I am actually going to write down now, in this chapter.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 1: </strong>Pick a maximum of three hues. More hues can really make a design look cluttered, too flashy, even if the colours are picked out very carefully. And on top of that: less is more.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 2: </strong>Use a main colour scheme of <em> 5 colours</em>. This means that at least two of the colours should be shades/tints/tones of one of the three main hues. You can try adding more colours, but usually five is enough. You'll have a background colour, text colour, headline/logo colour, and two colours for accents, special words, highlights, etcetera.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 3: </strong>When working with maps, infographics, or any other kind of data or design with a lowest point and highest point, it's best to use a so-called <em>sequential palette</em>. Pick diverging colours for both ends, and mix and fade those hues into (slightly) neutral colours in the middle.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 4: </strong>Keep a balanced contrast between shades and tints. They are created by keeping the hue the same, and changing the percentage of saturation and that of the brightness. If you create a different shade or tint of your hue, make it at least 10% different from it (or it will look weird and like you added a slightly different colour on accident), but don't move in steps greater than 60%.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 5: </strong>Know your colour's meanings. Don't just pick a random colour to start from, but choose one or two base colours that represent what your design wants to say. You'll learn about this in the chapter on colour emotions.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 6: </strong>Rules are guidelines. Start by using the rules, but fine-tune your scheme to solve any problems or add some extra. Using the rules you might get a matching colour scheme of five colours, but if three of those look dull, you might want to think again.</p>

<h2>Colour Relationships</h2>

<p>I'll now give you the six typical ways that colours are matched. Do note that these start from a certain base colour, and create the whole colour scheme. Don't start with one colour, move to one that matches and blindly apply the same technique with the new colour. It might work sometimes, but will often fail.</p>

<p><img src="media/ColourRelationshipsHarmonies.png" /></p>

<p>The main idea is that analogous schemes are quiet, peaceful and harmonious, while complementary schemes are exciting and playful. Anything in between tries to balance these aspects.</p>

<h3>Analogous</h3>

<p>Three colours right next to each other on the colour wheel. They are perceived as unified, but more varied than monochromatic schemes.</p>

<h3>Complementary</h3>

<p>Two colours opposite of each other. When mixed together, they desaturate or neutralize each other. When positioned right next to each other, however, they increase intensity.</p>

<h3>Split Complementary</h3>

<p>If the contrast from the complementary method is too intense, you can instead choose the colours directly left and right of that opposite colour.</p>

<h3>Double Complementary</h3>

<p>If you want more variation, apply a double split complementary. You'll get four hues out of it that go well together, but it's still recommended to use only two or three of them as main colours and the others for highlights.</p>

<h3>Triad</h3>

<p>The middle ground of all the previous methods. It has variation, three hues, and some contrast but not too much. It's perceived as strong, dynamic, and vibrant.</p>

<h3>Monochromatic</h3>

<p>Different shades, tones and tints of one hue. Apply some of these, but don't make your whole colour scheme only one colour. Such schemes are percevied as unified and homogenous.</p>

<h3>Achromatic</h3>

<p>There's also the <em>achromatic method</em>. This simply means that you only use white, black and greys for your design. With everything now being able to display or print colour, using it has fallen out of fashion. However, it can still be the perfect scheme for specific uses, like going for a vintage feel, a black-and-white photography portfolio, etcetera.</p>

<h2>Creating colour schemes</h2>

<p>Knowing these relationships helps a great deal, but there's one last step to make. These guidelines only help you find your hues, which means you still need to set a <em>saturation</em> and <em>brightness</em> for each one.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 7: </strong>Don't use contrasting/opposite colours with the same saturation or brightness.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 8: </strong>With colours that are very close to each other on the wheel (think one or two steps difference), try to keep one of the two (<em>saturation or brightness</em>) the same and only change the other by a noticeable amount. Leaving both saturation and brightness at the same level is not recommended, although you get away with it sometimes.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 9:</strong> Often times, a transitional colour is added between two colours that are far apart on the colour wheel. Not only makes this the transition between the two less harsh, it automatically gives you an extra hue to play with.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 10: </strong>Always play around with shades, tones and tints. Making that subtle change to a colour, adding that second lighter or darker version of the same hue, can make all the difference in the world.</p>

<p>However, as I said earlier, all these rules are great, but you can still make your own <strong>custom schemes</strong> which abandon some or all of these theories. It is hard, and takes a lot of effort, but the pay-off is that you can get exactly what you want, and probably nobody has ever done it this exact way before.</p>

<h2>What to do with Neutrals</h2>

<p>Grayscale neutrals can be added to everything, and shouldn't be part of your five colours unless one of your neutral colours is very important. You can always add black, white or greys to your design---they take over warmth or coolness from surrounding colours.</p>

<p>Warm neutrals offer some more colour, which means you should be a bit more cautious. Don't add more than two warm neutrals, and don't add total black or total white if you already have warm neutrals.</p>

<h2>Creating Mood with Palettes</h2>

<p>To give you a good starting point, I want to give some general guidelines about the mood certain palettes convey, and how different colours relate to each other.</p>

<p>Designs that feel active and dynamic tend to have bright and highly saturated colours contrasting each other. Conversely, designs with a <em>muted palette</em> (highly desaturated tints) have a quiet and calming feeling. Additionally, muted palettes are an effective setup for increasing the impact of bright accent colours.</p>

<p>Designs that provide a sense of mystery or exclusivity, tend to have a dark overall feeling, perhaps with some spare but bright highlights/accents.</p>

<p>Natural colour palettes have an earthy feeling. They often include soft, muted colours, low in saturation, but that doesn't necessarily have to be that way. The primary components are: greens, browns, orange, yellow-ish colours.</p>

<h2>Great Tool for Colour Schemes</h2>

<p>Adobe has made a fine website which allows you to create colour schemes easily, draw inspiration from designs other people made or upload a photo to get its colour scheme: <a href="https://color.adobe.com/nl/">Adobe Kuler</a></p>"

  title: "[Colour Theory] Context"
  post: "<p>One of the most important properties of colours---one that people often forget---is the fact that our perception of it changes when placed in a different context. Colour is highly contextual; it may connote positive feelings in one context, but portray the opposite effect in another. Colours carry different meanings across different cultures and people.</p> 

<p>For example, white text on a black background jumps out more than black text on a white background. Orange between yellow hues looks less bright than the same colour among red hues. Dark brown surrounded by dark green looks less saturated than when placed in a yellow environment. Certain colours can even change our perception of the size of design elements!</p>

<p>While these differences are subtle, they are important. Changing the surroundings of a colour is not going to change the hue, but rather change perception of saturation and brightness. These can work against you, but you can also use these to your advantage.</p>

<p>However, there are no specific rules for how a colour will behave. Most of it is just trying out different combinations and trying to describe the effect they have on each other.</p>

<h2>Shifts in Brightness</h2>

<p><img src="media/ColourContextBrightness.png" /></p>

<p>Light colours surrounded by dark ones appear lighter. Dark colours surrounded by light ones appear darker.</p>

<p>A more noticeable, and annoying, concept is that of the <strong>slight lightness difference</strong>. If you have two colours with only a slight change in lightness, your brain is going nuts over if they are the same colour or not. To solve this, they usually appear more contrasted than they are, but with a subtle, light crisp at the edge; they appear luminous and unstable.</p>

<p>First of all, I forbid you to ever choose two colours that are nearly exact copies. But if it happens, know that when you place these elements in an environment with a <em>huge</em> difference in lightness, these problems are weakened and partially resolved.</p>

<p>NOTE: These crispy edges can also appear when you put high lightness, high contrast colours together.</p>

<p>And lastly, <strong>darker</strong> elements are affected more by surrounding elements. Say you create a row of squares with decreasing brightness from white to black, with the same difference in value between each of them. If you place this on a grey background, you will notice that the differences in value between the darker squares appears much greater than that of the white ones.</p>

<h2>Shifts in Saturation</h2>

<p><img src="media/ColourContextChroma.png" /></p>

<p>Say we have a moderately saturated colour. If we place it on an almost unsaturated background it will appear to have a higher saturation. If we place it on a highly saturated background, it will appear dull.</p>

<p>This shift in Chroma comes with an extra effect: if the contrast is big enough, a change in <strong>hue</strong> might even be perceived.</p>

<h2>Colour Range</h2>

<p>The reason colour behaves so differently in different environments, mainly has to do with two things: <em>colour constancy</em> and the <em>afterimage</em> effect.</p>

<p>Color constancy is the phenomenon in which your eye reads two instances of the same colour as being the same colour, despite the fact that one instance is in light, and another is in shade. In other words, our mind determines whether a the colour it sees is affected by its surroundings (light, shadow, reflection), and automatically compensates for it.</p>

<p>The afterimage effect states that looking at something for a few seconds (or longer) makes our visual receptors grow accustomed to it, which means that if you look away you see the opposite colours appearing out of nowhere. This means that as your eyes move around a design, even if they move only a little, they will automatically incorporate aspects of the other colours within their view.</p>

<p>Because of these properties, adding a darker colour to a design would create an overall darker effect, while adding a lighter one yields an overall lighter design. This effect is known as optical mixing, or the Bezold effect. Similarly, colours that don't contrast each other blend together and reduce their impact or function as accent colour.</p>

<p>Knowing that colours appear light or dark relative to each other, we can talk a bit about the <em>colour range</em> of a project. In some cases, a huge range is good, while others require a much smaller one. Adding colours far apart from each other---in terms of darkness/brightness---increases the (typographical and) colour range of a project. On the other and, colours close in value but different in hue create a vibrant yet soft effect; which becomes even softer when analogous colours are used. In the first case, a big range means lots of contrast and dynamics within a design, but can also mean restlessness and chaos. In the second case, a small range means little contrast or difference, but more calm and static designs.</p>

<h2>Text over Images</h2>

<p>Finding an elegant way to put text over images is often hard. An image contains <em>a lot</em> of different colours, and you can never find one way that works well with all of them. Here's what you can do:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Change the image.</strong> You can overlay the image with a slightly opaque white or black rectangle to compress the range of colours to a range of near-neutrals. Then you can put any colour over it.</li>
	<li><strong>Put the text in a box. </strong>Simply putting the text in its own, perhaps slightly opaque, box also removes all the problems. The image is still visible around and underneath it, but the main focus is on the box and its content. A white or black box usually works, but you can use all sorts of matching colours this way.</li>
	<li><strong>Gradients. </strong>If the text is smaller than the image, you can use a gradient from white to transparent (or black to transparent) to only mask the part of the image you need to put the text over (and a bit around it, make it a smooth gradient).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Last Notes</h2>

<p>Any effects due to colour context are most apparent in colours that are very close in hue, or are complementary (almost complete opposites of each other when it comes to hue). Any other colour is barely affected by the other colour's presence, but shifts in brightness and saturation can still occur.</p>

  title: "[Colour Theory] Emotions & Meaning"
  post: "<p>If you don't know where to start, it is advised to think of the main keywords applicable to your project and find a colour that matches. Every colour has its own meaning, purpose and emotional value. Those are mostly international, but some countries even have special meanings for colours that can make the difference between a gigantic fail and a well thought out design.</p> 

<p>These natural responses to certain colours are largely a result of our history and evolution. Properly reacting to colour may have helped our ancestors survive, and much of our reactions to various colours seem to result from our association of these colours with certain specific natural objects. We assume that, because one or two things with a certain colour have certain natural properties, everything with that colour works that way. This is a false generalization, but it's very effective and perceived that way by nearly everyone.</p>

<p>On top of that, colours can inherently contain subjective meanings. People's past experience with a colour, the colour through which objects are often represented, it all contributes to a certain association and understanding of a specific hue. For example, red is associated with blood, fire, and sex; blue is associated with sea, sky, and ice.</p>

<p>I will walk you through all the main colours and explain a bit. Every colour will at the end of its section have a line containing all the keywords, feelings and emotions associated with it.</p>

<h2>White</h2>

<p>Popular in minimalist designs, gives other colours a larger voice.</p>

<p>White can be used to portray winter or summer, depending on the elements around it.</p>

<p>Usually associated with wedding dresses and health care (dentists, doctors, nurses)</p>

<p>Used to depict angels and heaven.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Purity, cleanliness, virtue, innocence, wholeness, completion, openness, light, goodness, heaven, sincerity</p>

<h2>Black</h2>

<p>The strongest of all colours, has a positive and negative side. For example, sports teams wearing black are often perceived as meaner and more aggressive, while on the other hand black outfits are associated with sophistication, exclusivity, and intrigue.</p>

<p>Depicts power, elegance and formality, but also evil, death, mystery and mourning. It's, however, also associated with rebellion, the occult and Halloween in some cultures.</p>

<p>Black is often used in edgier, modern designs, and is highly influenced by its surrounding elements. It's Commonly used for typography or other large functional parts because of its extreme neutrality.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Mystery, elegance, evil, formality, strength, fear, power, death, aggression, authority, sophistication</p>

<h2>Grey</h2>

<p>Dark greys can be used in place of black, light greys in place of white.</p>

<p>Normal grey is usually perceived as moody, depressing, cold or the colour of mourning.</p>

<p>Grey is generally used on formal documents, but it can easily be used in a modern design, if formality and professionalism are key.</p>

<p>In web design, grey backgrounds and grey typography is very common.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Moody, conservative, formality, emotionless, dirty, formal, sophisticated</p>

<h2>Brown</h2>

<p>Depending on the saturation and surroundings, brown can be very warm, but also dull or flat.</p>

<p>Commonly used as background colour, and in textures (wood, stone, grainy, old paper).</p>

<p>Can be used with a dark shade as a replacement for black, but that depends on the other elements.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Nature, wholesomeness, dependability, relaxation, confidence, durability, comfort, reliability, wood, earth, stone</p>

<h2>Beige &amp; Tan</h2>

<p>It has the same properties as brown, but contains more grey and white. It is therefore easier to use this as a neutral, but it is also more easily seen as dull.</p>

<p>Usually used in some sort of paper (texture) background, is extremely good at taking on properties of surround elements and therefore usually goes unnoticed in any design.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Conservative, piety, dull, neutral, calm, relaxing, crisp, coolness, boring</p>

<h2>Cream &amp; Ivory</h2>

<p>Contains some of brown's warmth, but more of white's good properties.</p>

<p>They usually go unnoticed in a design, convey a sense of history or calm.</p>

<p>Can create elegance and sometimes earthy quality in a design. It can also be used to create soft contrast with darker colours.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Calm, elegant purity, neutral, relaxing, pureness, softness, warmth, quiet, pleasantness, elegance</p>

<h2>Red</h2>

<p>A very hot colour. Associated with fire and violence, but also love and passion. Devil and Cupid. Communism and rebellion.</p>

<p>Associated with danger (traffic lights are red), but also importance (red carpet).</p>

<p>Has many different interpretations outside the western world. In China, it means happiness, prosperity and good luck. In other eastern cultures it's a common colour to use for weddings. In South Africa, it is the colour mourning. In the whole of Africa, it has become the colour associated with AIDS awareness due to the RED campaign.</p>

<p>It is a powerful accent colour, which means it is overwhelming when used too much (especially in a more pure form). Used when power or passion want to be portrayed.</p>

<p>Red is versatile, which means that brighter tints are more energetic, while darker shades are more powerful and elegant.</p>

<p>It's even been shown that red has a physical effect on people, raising blood pressure, respiration rates and metabolism. It suppresses your ability to think rationally, and is best used to drive user behaviour or display (urgent) error messages. Women wearin red are often perceived as more attractive, and men wearing red as more dominant. Because of this, avoid using red in educational, objective or performance-based contexts.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Passion, love, anger, power, strength, energy, intense, war, danger.</p>

<h2>Orange</h2>

<p>Associated with earth and autumn, changing of seasons, and change and movement in general.</p>

<p>Means health and vitality, and draws attention without being as powerful as red. Considered friendly, inviting and a bridge between colourful hues and warm neutrals.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Energy, happiness, vitality, cheerfulness, creativity, warmth, enthusiasm, success, autumn, stimulating</p>

<h2>Yellow</h2>

<p>Mostly associated with joy, sunshine and extreme happiness and brightness. It's also often associated with sales, deals, prices, or other positive commercial designs.</p>

<p>Also means danger, but is used more as a slight warning or comment, whereas red is more urgent. It's therefore used to call attention to notes or messages which aren't necessarely urgent, and it's also the default colour for highlighting.</p>

<p>In Egypt, yellow represents mourning. Japan uses it to portray courage, while it's a colour for merchants in India. Throughout the world, it is used as a symbol of hope (think of yellow ribbons for loved ones at war).</p>

<p>Soft yellows are used as gender-neutral colour for babies or (young) children. They give more of a calm or happy feeling than bright yellows. Dark (or gold-like) yellows can look antique and display a sense of permanence.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Happiness, hope, deceit, energy, happiness, liveliness, curiosity, intelligence, brightness, sunshine, joy, attention getter</p>

<h2>Green</h2>

<p>Means down-to-earth, the start of a new beginning. This means it also portrays lack of experience, envy or jealousy. Is the general colour used when the design has something to do with money. It's also seen as a mark of progress, an indication that a product has a certain feature or component, and a postive colour for call-to-action buttons.</p>

<p>It is calming, in much the same way as blue. But the fact that it has yellow included means it is more balanced, harmonizing, stable and energetic.</p>

<p>Bright greens are vibrant and full of energy, olive greens are more representative of the natural world, while dark greens are the most stable and give a sense of wealth.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Harmony, life, help, new beginnings, abundance, nature, balance, harmony, safety, freshness, healing, fertility, growth</p>

<h2>Blue</h2>

<p>Associated with sadness and calmness, but also peace, spirituality and religions.</p>

<p>Light blues are friendly, relaxed and nature-like.</p>

<p>Bright blues are energizing and refreshing.</p>

<p>Dark blues are stronger and more reliable, excellent for corporate websites or designs. Dark blue, however, is also the standard colour for links on the internet, which means you should refrain from using it for anything else, unless your colour palette is bursting with blue.</p>

<p>In psychological terms, blue is the opposite of red. It boosts creativity and enhances performance, often leading to a greater trustworthiness of a design.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Calm, responsible, sadness, patience, peace, trustworthiness, stability, professionalism, honour, tranquil, masculine, sky, sea</p>

<h2>Purple</h2>

<p>Mostly associated with royalty, creativity and imagination.</p>

<p>Thailand uses it as the colour for mourning.</p>

<p>Dark purples are reserved for wealth, royalty and luxury. Light versions are more romantic and seem more colourful. Often they are also associated with softness, spring and dreams.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Creativity, royalty, wealth, power, ability, wisdom, nobility, luxury, ambition, mystery</p>

<h2>Pink</h2>

<p>Pink is usually seen as the colour for (little) girls, and sweetness (sugar, spice, everything nice). It has the same good properties as red, but not the bad ones because of its softness.</p>

<p>While red creates physical awareness and strength, pink can create physical weakness. It represents love, charm and romance.</p>

<p>Bright pink communicates playfulness, light pink tenderness.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Romance, passivity, care, peace, affection, softness</p>

  title: "How to Play the Cajon"
  post: "<p>The Cajon has seen a huge increase in popularity the last decade. More and more artists start doing acoustic sessions or including acoustic versions with their songs, and for beginning musicians it is also less expensive to buy a Cajon instead of drum kit. Whether it's just used for a hobby or not: the Cajon is a simple, friendly instrument that is capable of creating a wide variety of beats.</p> 

<p>This article will go over the basic structure of a Cajon, the basic ways to hit or strike it and discuss some of the most common beats. I am tempted to call it the fundamentals of the Cajon, but in reality there is not much more to know than this article teaches you. A lot is possible with this instrument, but you'll only invent new possibilities by experimenting yourself.</p>

<h2>What's a Cajon?</h2>

<p>A Cajon is usually referred to as an acoustic drum. It is basically a wooden, rectangular box standing upright. At one side of the box is the special <strong>striking face </strong>---this is where your hands strike the Cajon to create wonderful sounds. All other sides are also solid wood, but don't create as nice tones.</p>

<p>At the back is a circular hole, similar to the one found in guitars. When a sound is created, it resonates within the box and then leaves the Cajon through that hole. Not only does this increase the volume, it also creates a nicer timbre. It is, after all, only a piece of wood you're hitting, and it needs some love to make it sound nice with other (acoustic) instruments.</p>

<p>Inside the more expensive ones, a <strong>snare</strong> is also added. The snare drum is an essential component of any drum kit, and adding one inside your Cajon makes it sound more like a drum kit. You can usually take it out or turn it off, which makes it sound more like actually hitting wood (think of the sound when you hit two drum sticks against each other, or when you slam your thumb against a guitar for some rhythm).</p>

<p><img src="media/CajonStructureBasicStrikes.png" /></p>

<h2>The Basic Strikes</h2>

<p>A distinction is usually made between 4 strikes, but some think they sound too much alike and work with three. Either way, there are some fundamentals to learn:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Bass</strong>: the root and start of every beat. Sounds like the bass drum. Low on the Cajon. Hit it with the hard and strong part of your hand just before your fingers start (we'll call it the <em>finger cushion</em>). You can also hit it the usual way, more with your fingers and a flat hand, which will get the snare more involved.</li>
	<li><strong>Slap</strong>: the other essential part of a beat. Sounds like the snare. High on the Cajon. Hit it with your finger cushion and fingers.</li>
	<li><strong>Mid</strong>: a mid-tone between the bass and slap. Used as a transition between the two, to keep the beat flowing. Hit only with your fingertips (keep your hand slightly cupped).</li>
	<li><strong>High slap</strong>: for rhythmic/melodic notes once in a while. The highest on the Cajon---every part of the hand, except for your fingers, should be above the striking face. Strike with fingers flat and a bit spread out, and use only your fingertips. Can also be hit one finger at a time, for very quick rhythms.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: Don't cup your hand with the bass and slap. They make the sound weak and flat. These two strikes are what you'll be doing most of the time, and you should have them perfected before you start doing anything else.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: Use <strong>both hands</strong>. It might be hard to do any rhythmic stuff with your non-dominant hand, but with training you should be able to get both hands at the same level. This has the huge advantage of being able to play more beats, faster and without making mistakes.</p>

<h2>Good Posture</h2>

<p>Good posture is important, always. But, the Cajon is a somewhat awkward instrument: as you sit on it, you have to slightly bend over to let your hands reach every part of the striking face. To prevent back and/or shoulder injuries, follow these tips:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Where should I leave my legs?</em> Most people have the tendency to put them symmetrically left/right of the Cajon. There's nothing really wrong with that, but there's another way:

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Place your left foot in front of the Cajon, and your right foot pushed against the right side of the Cajon. Don't turn your body with it---just bend your knees to be comfortable in this position. This has two advantages: it frees up some space for your <em>dominant hand</em> (if right is not your dominant hand, do this in reverse), and you can use your <em>foot</em> for some extra fancy beats.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><em>Should I bend my back? </em>No. Bass notes are low on the Cajon, but not as extremely low as most people think. If you keep your back and head/neck straight, and lean only slightly forward, you should be able to reach everything easily.</li>
	<li>Sit in the centre of the Cajon. Too far to the front or back makes it impossible to strike anything.</li>
	<li>Maintain a good posture, but don't get all stiff and rigid. Move your upper body rhythmically as you play. It also looks cooler that way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, don't get too enthusiastic with hitting the Cajon if you're just starting out. Your hands aren't used to striking wood, and will start to hurt or tire after a while. When you just start out, this means that you should take a break. If it still happens after a while, your smashing it <em>too hard</em>. You don't need massive power to make a good sound.</p>

<h2>Basic Beats</h2>

<p>Theoretically, every beat can be transferred to the Cajon. Every rhythm you've heard the drum play in pop/rock songs can be converted to one on the Cajon (albeit simplified).</p>

<p>Every beat starts with the <strong>bass</strong>. Whatever you do, you need to get this right. It is the soul of a beat, it's what creates the rhythm and structure.</p>

<p>Then, to alternate the bass, is the <strong>slap</strong> or snare. Hitting a bass on each count is rather monotone or boring. The usual pattern is therefore that bass and slap alternate every count. Start with bass, snare at 1 second, bass at 2 seconds, snare at 3 and start the next beat (after 4 seconds) with a bass again---repeat.</p>

<p>But, especially with slower beats, there's a lot of time between these fundamental tones where nothing happens. That is where the <strong>mid</strong> or <strong>high slap</strong> come into play to create a sort of melody and transition notes.</p>

<p>Now on to some more specific info! These are very basic rhythms you should learn and master (these are all simple, regular 4/4---4 seconds in a beat):</p>

  title: "Fundamentals of Chess"
  post: "<p>Welcome to the course that will teach you how to play the famous game of Chess! Not only does it teach you the basic moves and rules, but it also explains the fundamental tactics and principles that will improve your game significantly. In the end though, the only way to become really good at it, is practice, experiment, practice.</p> 

<p>Chess is an ancient game. Long ago, there was a king that ordered one of his servants to create a game to free him from his boredom. That guy thought for a long time, and then invented the game we now know and play as 'Chess'. As a reward he was allowed to ask anything from the king, and he would give it to him. But, the inventor was smart, and tricked the king. First, he put one grain of corn on the first field. Then he asked the king to put twice the amount on the next field, and twice that amount on the next one, and so on and on until all fields on the board were filled. As the king was counting, he discovered there wasn't enough grain in the whole world to live up to his demands. He rewarded the inventor with something else: he made the game famous. Nowadays, it is still more popular than ever.</p>

<p>But that's enough history for now! Let's start.</p>

<h2>What do I need?</h2>

<p>Two players, a chess board (8x8), and the 16 <em>white</em> and 16 <em>black</em> pieces that belong to it.</p>

<p>You can also play on your computer against an AI, but it's recommended to get a real chess set and try your luck against human opponents.</p>

  title: "[Chess] Your Objective"
  post: "<p>Simply said, your objective is to place your pieces in such a way, that your opponent has <strong>no legal moves left </strong>and his <em>king</em> is <strong>under attack</strong>. The more common way to say this is that you have to <strong>checkmate</strong> your opponent. Of course, you want this to happen before <em>you</em> have been checkmated by your opponent.</p> 

<h2>Capturing</h2>

<p><em>When is something 'under attack'?</em> When it can be captured by your opponent the next turn.</p>

<p>Capturing is nothing more than moving one of your pieces to a square that is occupied by one of your opponent's pieces. You take the opponent's piece off the board, and place your own piece at its spot. You've just captured something.</p>

<h2>Legal Moves</h2>

<p><em>What are legal moves? </em>This depends on the specific piece, but there's one single very important rule here:</p>

> If your <em>king</em> is under attack (<strong>checked</strong>), your next move needs to make sure he isn't anymore.

> (You can 'uncheck' your king by 1) moving it 2) capturing the piece that's threatening it 3) putting a piece between the king and it's attacker, blocking the line of attack)

<p>Therefore, if your king is checked, but you can't do anything to prevent or solve it, you have been checkmated and have lost the game.</p>

<p>This may all seem a bit vague, but don't worry, the next chapters will discuss the board and all pieces, and (hopefully) make everything clear!</p>

<h2>Draw</h2>

<p>Sometimes there's no winner. There are 5 situations in which this can occur:</p>

<ul>
	<li>There are not enough pieces left on the board to checkmate.</li>
	<li><strong>Stalemate:</strong> a player can't do a legal move, but his king isn't under attack.</li>
	<li>If both players see that a situation is hopeless, they can agree on a draw.</li>
	<li>If the exact same board position has occurred three times in the game, a player <em>can</em> say that it's a draw.</li>
	<li>If 50 moves have been played, in which none of the players have moved a pawn or captured a piece.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first three options are way more common than the last two.</p>

<p><em>Stalemate</em> is something that needs a little special attention. Even if you have all your pieces left, and the opponent has only his king left, a stalemate is a draw. Therefore, a player that is losing will always try to get into a stalemate---pay attention to that.</p>

  title: "[Chess] The Board & Starting Position"
  post: "<p><img src="media/ChessBoard&amp;Definitions.png" /></p>

<p>A chess board is a collection of squares, 8 columns and 8 rows. That means <strong>8 x 8</strong> = 64 fields to play on. Do not mistake it for a <em>checkers board</em>---that is 10 by 10.</p> 

<p>The rows are numbered <strong>1</strong> to <strong>8</strong>, and the columns given the letters <strong>a</strong> to <strong>h</strong>. This has no influence at all on a game---it's just for saving a board position or recording a chess match. The columns are usually called <strong>files</strong>.</p>

<p>The squares alternate (both horizontally and vertically) between black and white (or another contrasting colour combination), which is known as the <em>checkers pattern</em>. Not only does this help distinguish the individual squares, it can also play a huge role in your tactics---it's useful to know what colour of squares a piece can and cannot reach.</p>

<p>In the image, the starting position for black and white is shown. This is the setup at the start of every game. To remember the order of the queen and king, know this: the <em>queen</em> always starts on a field with the <em>same colour</em> as itself. So white queen on white square, black queen on black square.</p>

<p>When you get into (advanced) tactics, it's useful to know the different parts of a board:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Queenside: </strong>the four columns at the side where the queen starts the game.</li>
	<li><strong>Kingside:</strong> the four columns at the side where the king starts the game.</li>
	<li><strong>Backline: </strong>the last row of the board, where the kings start. Sometimes also used for the last two rows of the board.</li>
	<li><strong>Centre </strong>(or center): the middle rows of the board, numbers 3 to 6. The four squares in the centre of the whole board are generally regarded as the most important ones in the whole game. You want to control them, and never let go.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What are they useful for then?</em> There's a lot of space on a board, and you only have limited pieces. Therefore, it's good to make a decision and either make your <em>queenside</em> very strong, or your<em> kingside</em>. On top of that, pieces at the backline are usually very safe (behind an army of pawns and other pieces), and pieces at the centre have the most attacking options!</p>

<h2>Stages of a Game</h2>

<p>A distinction is made between three parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Opening:</strong> White starts. Both players are building their defence, making room for pieces, setting up solid structures. Maybe they will attack a pawn or threaten a piece every now and then, but nothing big. A lot of standard openings are known by professional chess players, and it usually depends on the opponent what they choose to use.</li>
	<li><strong>Middle game:</strong> Both sides have their basic setup done. This is the longest, and where the most interesting things happen. There are lot of options here; playing defensive, offensive, improving positional play, slowly but steadily moving pawns forward, etcetera.</li>
	<li><strong>End game:</strong> A lot of pieces have been removed, and the defensive structures destroyed. Both players are left with a handful of pieces, and one of them usually has a clear advantage (more pieces, a better position, etcetera). If that player is smart, he wins the game in maybe ten or twenty moves. If he isn't smart, or he is too careful, the opponent may turn the odds by a very good move (which is possible, because the game is so open).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now it's finally time to get to know all the pieces and their capabilities!</p>

  title: "[Chess] Pawns & Pieces"
  post: "<p>From this moment on, a distinction will be drawn between pawns and pieces. You start with 8 <em>pawns</em>, which are limited in their movement, but working together are be very powerful. You also start with 8 pieces, which are:</p> 

<ul>
	<li>One king.</li>
	<li>One queen.</li>
	<li>Two bishops.</li>
	<li>Two knights.</li>
	<li>Two rooks.</li>
</ul>

<p>These pieces have a lot of moves they are allowed to do, but it's harder to get them working together.</p>

<p>Therefore, we like to view pawns and pieces as two separate groups with their own strengths and weaknesses, which will need to destroy the opponent together. This will become more clear when you dive into tactics, but for now, let's explain all they can do!</p>

<h2>General Movement Rules</h2>

<p>All pawns and pieces</p>

<ul>
	<li>Can be moved to any <strong>unoccupied square</strong> without problems</li>
	<li>Can be moved to any <strong>occupied square</strong>, with one of the opponent's pawns or pieces on it, which it then <em>captures</em>.</li>
	<li>With exception of the knight, may <strong>not</strong> jump over other pawns or pieces</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>With exception of pawns, have the same rules for <em>moving</em> as well as <em>capturing</em>.</li>
	<li>Are <strong>not obliged</strong> to capture something when the opportunity arises. You can do anything you like (unlike checkers).</li>
	<li>Cannot be moved to a certain square if that means the king becomes checked. Is of course also true for the king himself.</li>
</ul>

<p>The easiest way to remember this is: <em>if the opponent captures your king, you've lost the game</em>. So, never move the king to a spot where it can possibly be captured.</p>

<h2>King ('Infinite points')</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessMovementKing.png" /></p>

<p>Your most important piece. Protect it at all costs. Allowed to move <strong>one square</strong> in <strong>any direction</strong>.</p>

<p>The king should always be safe, and has little to no offensive use. You should therefore keep it at the backline, and preferably a bit to the left or right. The only moment you should start moving your king or letting it get involved is at the end of a game, when there's not much pieces left that can attack it.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Pawn (1 point)</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessMovementPawn.png" /></p>

<p>Allowed to move <strong>one square</strong> horizontally, but only forwards. However, the first time a pawn makes a move (when it is still at its starting position), it is allowed to move <strong>two squares</strong> instead of one.</p>

<p>What's special, is that a pawn <em>captures</em> pieces by moving one square <strong>diagonally</strong>.</p>

<p>At the beginning of a game, you need to make room to get your pieces away from the backline. Most games therefore start with pushing pawns forward. You want to control the centre, so pushing the pawn on the <strong>d</strong> or <strong>e </strong>file forward is a common opening move.</p>

<p>The fact that pawns capture diagonally, creates the possibility to create intricate pawn structures---a chain of diagonally placed pawns protecting each other. It's also a good idea to make the king hide behind a wall of pawns.</p>

<div style="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Bishop (3 points)</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessMovementBishop.png" /></p>

<p>Allowed to move <strong>unlimited </strong>squares <strong>diagonally</strong>. 'Unlimited' doesn't mean that it can do whatever it wants, but just that it can move in a single direction (diagonally) until it hits the side of the board or a pawn/piece.</p>

<p>Together with the knights, you want to get this piece away from the backline and into the centre as quickly as possible. Another option is to point them towards the centre, so that nobody gets to control it.</p>

<div style="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Knight (3 points)</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessMovementKnight.png" /></p>

<p>This one usually confuses people at first, but is actually very simple. It can move <strong>one square diagonally</strong>, followed by <strong>one square horizontally/vertically</strong>. Another way to look at it, is that it can move in an <strong>L</strong> shape in all directions. You can check if you got it right this way: <em>the knight should always land on a square of the opposite colour as the one he started on.</em></p>

<p>The knight is the only piece that can jump over other ones. That, combined with its odd L-shape movement, makes it hard to predict or defend against. However, they have a limited range (even more so when they are positioned to the sides), and are therefore seen as equally useful as the bishop.</p>

<p>Working together, knight and bishop are the life of your army, and should be the ones breaking through your opponent's defence.</p>

<div style="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Rook (5 points)</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessMovementRook.png" /></p>

<p>Allowed to move <strong>unlimited</strong> squares<strong> horizontally </strong>or <strong>vertically</strong>.</p>

<p>When the game starts, they are tucked away in the corners, and it will take some time before they get involved in the game. They are therefore mostly used in the endgame, when most of the other pawns and pieces are gone. But, don't think that you should leave them alone until then. When you find the space, get them out of the corners to support pieces from the backline.</p>

<div style="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Queen (9 points)</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessMovementQueen.png" /></p>

<p>By far the most powerful piece. Allowed to move <strong>unlimited</strong> squares in <strong>any direction</strong>.</p>

<p>Losing the queen usually means you've lost the game. Therefore, it is advised to not bring the queen into the battlefield until the mid or end game. Her starting position is at the backline, in the centre, which is (for the queen) an ideal position when opening the game---don't move it.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, keep the queen close to your king. It is called the queen for a reason: it has to stand alongside the king, protecting him, working together to withstand the opponent's attacks.</p>

<div style="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>What's with the points?</h2>

<p>They are merely guidelines. Every piece is assigned a points value based on how much it's worth, when it comes to offensive and defensive possibilities. This system is used to teach people about whether to capture or not.</p>

<p>Capturing a queen with a pawn is terrific---you've removed a 9 point queen with a 1 point pawn.</p>

<p>Capturing a rook with a bishop is also considered a good trade---you are now 2 points ahead of your opponent.</p>

<p>However, capturing a knight with a bishop, should only be done if that knight is harmful. The points are equal, so the only reason to do the capture is if that knight was threatening your queen, checking your king, defending its own king, etcetera.</p>

<p>Do note though, that these 'rules' can be ignored in favour of a greater plan. If you have a solid plan to checkmate your opponent by sacrificing your queen, go ahead!</p>

<h2>Checkmate Example</h2>

<p>In case you hadn't grasped the concept of check and checkmate yet, here's an image that displays both situations.</p>

  title: "[Chess] Special Moves"
  post: "<p>There's a few undesirable events that could happen, when using only the rules I've explained thus far. That's why some special moves were invented to make the game faster and better: Castling, En Passent and Promotion.</p> 

<h2>Castling</h2>

<p><img src="media/ChessCastling.png" /></p>

<p>I've explained how useful it is to lock away your king to the right/left, and bring your rook out of the corner into the battlefield. However, with the current setup, it would take <em>a lot</em> of steps to get into that situation. Therefore, a very useful shortcut has been created.</p>

<p><strong>Castling: </strong>The act of moving your king 2 squares left or right, and teleporting the corresponding rook to the other side of the king. It's hard to explain in words, so please look at the image for clarification. To prevent people from overusing this trick, there are certain rules that tell when castling is <strong>not allowed</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If there's a piece between king and rook</li>
	<li>If the king is in check</li>
	<li>If the king or rook has been moved</li>
	<li>If one of the empty squares between king and rook are in check (<em>under attack</em>).</li>
	<li>If, after castling, the king would be in check.</li>
<li>If you've already castled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually, the game starts with moving knights and bishops away from the backline, and then---at the first moment it's possible---both players castle. If you're a more offensive person, you can save it for later and use that move to setup an attack. Just make sure you don't move your king or rook, and you can castle any time you want in the game.</p>

<h2>En Passent</h2>

<p><img src="media/ChessEnPassent.png" /></p>

<p>The second problem that occurred was that pawns can get locked very easily. Pawns can only move forward vertically, so the only chance they have to get onto another file is when they diagonally capture a pawn (or other piece, but that's more unlikely). If that doesn't happen, they are completely stuck the first time they hit a wall (opponent's piece or pawn). To make sure they never get off their own file, your opponent could just wait until your pawn reaches its own row of pawns, and then suddenly move two squares forward! To solve this there is the <em>en passent</em> rule, which is French for <em>as it passes </em>or <em>while passing</em>.</p>

<p><strong>En Passent: </strong>If your opponent moves its pawn two squares forward, so that it stands next to your pawn, you are allowed to move diagonally <em>behind</em> the opponent's pawn, and at the same time <em>capture</em> it. As you can see, this move is very useful and destroys defences, so you should always watch out. However, you can only capture a pawn 'en passent' the first turn after that pawn moved two squares forward. If you wait even one more turn, the opportunity is gone.</p>

<h2>Promotion</h2>

<p><img src="media/ChessPromotion.png" /></p>

<p>The last problem has to do with pawns again. When a pawn reaches the opponent's backline, it has absolutely no use anymore! It can't move forward, it can't capture anything, it can't do anything.</p>

<p>Therefore, when a pawn reaches that point, it <em>must</em> be <strong>promoted.</strong> This simply means that you can replace the pawn for a <strong>queen, rook, knight </strong>or <strong>bishop</strong>. Most people choose queen, because it is the most powerful. But, sometimes you need a knight for immediate checkmate, or you want a bishop or rook to prevent <em>stalemate</em>.</p>

  title: "[Chess] Tactics & Strategy"
  post: "<p>Capture as much as you can, don't get captured. That's usually what people have in mind, but it's not the right mind-set. You don't get points for every piece you capture. You don't necessarily win a game by having two pawns more than your opponent.</p> 

<p>The objective is to <em>checkmate</em> your opponent, and prevent your own king from being mated. Everything you do should in the end serve one of these purposes. Capturing the opponent's knight with a pawn is usually a good idea, but not of that creates a gap your opponent can use to his advantage. Attacking the queen time after time might yield a good result in the end (eventually you'll probably capture it), but if you have to move all your pieces to dangerous spots in the process, you're going to lose the game.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I want to look at <em>defensive</em> and <em>offensive</em> strategies. We start with defence, because most of the game is deflecting attacks.</p>

<h2>Defensive</h2>

<p>There are two moments when you want to deploy defensive measures; when a piece is directly under attack, and when you can see a threat beginning to build. Chess players need to think multiple steps ahead for exactly this reason: so that they can stop an attack before it even begins.</p>

<p>If you let the opponent attack, you are basically one step behind all the time. If you take action beforehand, you are in control and the opponent has to think of a new plan.</p>

<p>So let's say one of your opponent's pieces is threatening one of yours, here's six things you can do:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Move your piece. </strong>Simply move it out of the way. The downside: sometimes this creates gaps or weaknesses in your defence.</li>
	<li><strong>Take cover.</strong> Use another piece to defend it. This means that if the opponent were to actually capture your piece, you can in turn capture the opponent's piece the move after that. The downside: the threat still exists---you need to keep one extra thing in mind all the time.</li>
	<li><strong>Capture the opponent's piece. </strong>Sometimes, the threatening piece can be captured. If for example the opponent threatens your bishop with one of his own bishops, you can simply remove the threat by capturing it. The downside: equal exchange of pieces, which means none of the players gets better, and there's less options in the game.</li>
	<li><strong>Shield it</strong>. Put something (usually a pawn) in front of the piece, so that the opponent first has to break that barrier to get to the piece it wants. The downside: if the opponent manages to create another threat on the piece or its shield, it will be hard to keep them close and protecting each other.</li>
	<li><strong>Blackmail</strong>. Respond to the threat, by creating a different threat yourself. If your opponent attacks your knight, you can attack his queen. He doesn't want to lose his queen, so he first moves her out of the way before capturing that knight. The downside: it only buys you time, you run the risk of the opponent creating multiple threats.</li>
	<li><strong>Check your opponent</strong>. The opponent <em>must</em> resolve a king in check. It is in principle the most advanced version of blackmailing, and therefore has the same downsides.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are in no specific order---it all depends on the situation---but if possible, go through the options from top to bottom. Simply moving a piece or strengthening your defence will always be a safer and better option than using the few moves you have to resolve a threat to create more and more threats yourself.</p>

<p>When it comes to the other type of defence, against <em>possible dangers</em>, it works in exactly the same way. It is a bit more subtle, because a move against possible danger seems like it has no use when you first see it, but nevertheless it's very important.</p>

<h2>Offensive</h2>

<p>This chapter started by stressing the importance of making your <em>attacking moves</em> king-focused. But, you shouldn't take this advice as: <em>only attack the king. </em>What you really want to do, is remove every piece that stands between you and the opponent's king. Without losing your own pieces, that is.</p>

<p>If you don't have any piece that could threaten the opponent's king, it's not useful to make up an elaborate scheme to capture on of his pieces. Sure, you might in the end win a piece and get an advantage in points, but you've wasted a lot of moves. Moves that the opponent has used to build a better defence, or a structured attack targeting your king.</p>

<p>Only capture (or lure away) pieces that threaten your king, or that stand in the way when you are attacking the opponent's king. All other moves should be focused on defensive and tactical matters.</p>

<p>Now, to create great attacks, I want to introduce the <strong>double attack</strong>. It is, against a competent chess player, the only way to gain advantages or control over your opponent.</p>

<p>A double attack means nothing more than threatening <strong>2</strong> (or more) <strong>pieces</strong> with one move. The opponent has to resolve two threats with one move, which is rarely possible! But, it's not exactly as simple as it looks: when performing a double attack, you obviously don't want your piece to be captured. If that was the case, the opponent could just capture your piece, and voila---all threats resolved. Therefore, there are a limited amount of ways to set up double attacks, and I will discuss them in detail in the next few chapters:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Forks</li>
	<li>Discoveries</li>
	<li>The Pin and the Skewer</li>
	<li>Removing the Guard</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to memorize these attack patterns---it enables you to recognize them in-game, which in turn allows you to quickly plan these types of double attacks.</p>

  title: "[Chess] Forks"
  post: "<p>Forks are the simplest method for placing a double attack. A fork is nothing more than moving a piece in such a way that it attacks two pieces at once. No other piece is involved---just this single forking piece.</p>

<p>Therefore, being forked by your opponent is something you can (and should) see coming. Losing a piece to a fork is regarded almost as bad as losing a piece because you were careless. You can use this to your advantage: even the <em>threat</em> of a fork will force most opponents to do moves they don't want to do.</p> 

<p><img src="media/ChessFork.png" /></p>

<h2>How do I do it?</h2>

<p>The fork can be executed with all pieces and pawns, except for the king of course. A fork doesn't have to be a one-move thing---it's perfectly possible to spend 2 or 3 moves building up to the fork, because the reward is worth it: you capture a knight, bishop, rook or even queen.</p>

<p>The most common forking tool is the <strong>knight</strong>. The fact that it has an odd way of moving, and can jump over pieces, makes it possible to attack two pieces at once while not being threatened yourself. There's even an opening where you start with bringing your knights out and then within a few steps you can fork the opponent's king and rook, which means you win a rook!</p>

<p>After the knight, the most common forking tool is actually the <strong>pawn</strong>. Sometimes the opponent will place a lot of pieces into the centre of the board, and doesn't see that you can move your pawn forward and attack two of them at once. Usually though, to resolve such a fork the opponent will capture the pawn, so you must always have it backed with another pawn.</p>

<p>The <strong>bishop, rook</strong> and <strong>queen</strong> have similar forking capabilities. It's hard to find opportunities to fork, where you actually gain a points advantage. For example, a bishop will usually be impeded by intricate diagonal pawn structures and knights attacking the centre, which means the opponent could simply capture your piece if you try to fork. Similarly, the rook and queen are very valuable pieces, which are better at directly attacking the king or another piece than forking.</p>

<h2>Check forks</h2>

<p>One of the most common things people overlook in their defence, is a check fork. A check fork is when one of the pieces is the opponent's king. This forces your opponent to solve the check and leave the other piece in the fork where it is. If you look for this, you'll find it more often than you think.</p>

<p><em>Why?</em> Because when players see that you have the ability to check them, they only see that there's a way out (a piece they could put in the way, free squares for the king to move to, etcetera), and don't bother checking for forks.</p>

<p>This ties in directly with what I said in the <em>tactics &amp; strategy </em>chapter: make your only objective to checkmate the king. If on every move you at least <em>look into</em> the opportunities to put the king under pressures, you'll also find some forking opportunities appearing every now and then.</p>

  title: "[Chess] Discoveries"
  post: "<p>Unlike the fork, discoveries need <strong>two</strong> attacking pieces. In a discovery, you move one piece (<strong>unmasking piece</strong>) out of the way of another (<strong>unmasked piece</strong>), unleashing attacks on two enemy pieces at the same time. The enemy can only protect one, you take the other.</p> 

<p>As you can see, it takes more work to set up this kind of attack, but it's therefore also easier for your opponent to miss.</p>

<p><img src="media/ChessDiscovery.png" /></p>

<h2>How do I do it?</h2>

<p>Discoveries can be done by <strong>bishops, rooks, knights</strong> and <strong>pawns</strong>. Queens can also be involved, but only in <em>check discoveries</em>.</p>

<p>The most common ones are with <em>bishops</em>, either as unmasking or unmasked piece. Bishops have a very wide range of attack, which is usually only limited by your own pawns or pieces. That's why moving one of these out of the way creates all sorts of possibilities for a bishop.</p>

<p>For the non-diagonal attacks, <em>rooks</em> are the way to go. They are usually pointed at the opponent's king or queen from the back rank, with only one of your knights/bishops separating them. Move that out of the way, and you can launch a discovery.</p>

<p><em>Knights</em> and <em>pawns</em> can only be used as <em>unmasking pieces</em>. Knights can jump over pieces, and pawns have only a one-square attacking range---nothing changes their attacking range. Nevertheless, moving a pawn forward to launch a discovery is usually a better plan than using two pieces in an attack. That's because you want your pawns to move forward anyway, and they are worth less than any piece (in case things go wrong).</p>

<h2>Check discoveries</h2>

<p>Just as with forks, discoveries where one of the threatened enemy pieces is the king, are the best. The king has to move, which means you are sure you can capture the other piece you were attacking.</p>

<p>Check discoveries are the only moment you can (and should try to) use your <em>queen</em>. The queen has the most wide attacking range of them all, which means she makes it easy to set up a discovery. Usually a knight in front of your queen is moved to check the enemy king.</p>

  title: "[Chess] The Pin and Reverse Pin"
  post: "<p>This is where most novice chess player's knowledge ends. Forks and discoveries are very common attacking strategies, but the <strong>pin</strong> and <strong>reverse pin</strong> are a level higher.</p> 

<p>A pin involves one of your own pieces, and two enemy pieces on the same diagonal, horizontal or vertical. The idea is that you place a piece such that it runs through both enemy pieces (<strong>pinned</strong> piece and the <strong>target</strong> piece), but can't be captured. If the opponent moves the piece in front you capture the one at the back, and vice versa. Usually though, the target piece is more valuable than the pinned one.</p>

<p>Such situations are hard to find, if they occur at all, but it is a more valuable tool than forks or discoveries.</p>

<p><em>Why?</em> Because the pinned piece can't (or probably won't) move---then you could capture a more valuable piece. Therefore, pinning a piece means it is fixed to that square and can't do any defensive or offensive work. The opponent will try to resolve this by adding backup for the pieces, or move the target piece out of the pin.</p>

<p>In the first case, you can respond by adding more backup yourself. If that's not possible, you can try to use your move to exploit gaps your opponent has left by creating that backup.</p>

<p>In the second case, the pin is gone, and the only thing you can do is capture the <em>pinned piece</em> or forget about it and start planning something else.</p>

<p><img src="media/ChessPin.png" /></p>

<h2>How do I do it?</h2>

<p>Pawns and knights cannot help here. The same is true for the queen or king, because they are the most valuable pieces and will therefore not benefit from a pin. This leaves the <strong>bishops </strong>and <strong>rooks</strong>, which is only logical---pins can only be created at the same diagonal, horizontal or vertical.</p>

<p>Bishops are the most common pinning tool at the start and during the game, while rooks are used in the endgame to form pins with the enemy's king. Which brings us to&hellip;</p>

<h2>Check Pins</h2>

<p>Pins that have the most valuable piece of them all as the target: the king. These pins are very powerful, as the pinned piece can't move---that would check the king, which is not allowed. The opponent can only move the king to resolve the pin. Not only are you then able to capture the pinned piece, it also forces the enemy king into a bad position.</p>

<h2>Reverse Pins</h2>

<p>These are exactly what the name implies: the most valuable piece is at the front, while an equal or less valuable one is at the back. Roles of the pinned and target piece are reversed, as the opponent will probably opt to move the front piece (which is a queen, king or rook) out of the way. Then you can safely capture the piece at the back (usually a knight, bishop or in very close games even a pawn can make all the difference).</p>

<p>Again, using the king as target piece here, forces the opponent to move it out of the way in favour for maybe even a queen or rook at the back.</p>

<h2>Creating Pinning Opportunities</h2>

<p>Sometimes, a pin is available, but the pinned piece is able to <em>bite back</em>---it can just capture your piece if you decide to do the pin. If possible, you can capture the pinned piece. The opponent will have it guarded and recapture yours with some other type of piece. Now the same pin is still there, but with different pieces that you can take advantage of.</p>

<p>Other times, a pin is almost possible, but the opponent's king just needs to move one step. Then you can simply use a check or other threat towards the king to force it to move. The opponent will probably move it out of the way in a random direction without thinking, so if you're lucky you can then make the pin.</p>

  title: "[Chess] Removing the Guard"
  post: "<p>This type of double attack is last on the list, not because it is the least important, but because it is the most advanced type of attack. If you see an opportunity for it in a game, it seems so simple and obvious. But if you're not looking for it, you'll never find it.</p> 

<p>When you threaten an enemy piece, the opponent will usually refuse to move it and move a different piece to guard it. That's when a double attack opportunity arises: the guard also becomes a target. If you can get the guard out of position or off the board, the threatened piece is loose again and can be captured without consequences.</p>

<p><img src="media/ChessDistractGuard.png" /></p>

<p>There are four ways to remove this guard:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Capture it.</strong> Simply capture the guard, and make sure the opponent can't recapture with another guard.</li>
	<li><strong>Distract it. </strong>Capture or at least threaten some other piece, which forces the guard to recapture or move away.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Search for or create the <strong>overworked piece</strong>. An overworked piece is one that has multiple defensive responsibilities. This means that attacking another piece it defends distracts it and moves it away from its optimal defensive position. Sometimes, you first need to use a few moves to place multiple defensive responsibilities upon that single piece.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Attacking it.</strong> Forcing the guard to move by threatening it with something (of less value).</li>
	<li><strong>Blocking it.</strong> Putting a piece in between the guard and the guarded piece, which usually loosens both pieces.</li>
</ul>

<p>This guard removal can be done by any piece (except for the king) or pawn, and usually includes an exchange---both sides lose pieces of the same value, e.g. bishop for bishop, pawn for pawn.</p>

<p>The take-away rule here is that whenever your opponent introduces a guard, you should look for ways to destroy it. Because, as long as that guard lives, you can't take the piece you originally threatened.</p>

  title: "[Chess] Mating Patterns"
  post: "<p>Against decent players checkmating is hard, even if you have a huge piece advantage. On the other hand, you might be able to checkmate an opponent very early in the game with two or three brilliant moves. Therefore, I'd like to discuss some basic patterns which are used to checkmate someone 99% of the time. Knowing where you are going with your moves during the game helps a lot with planning your attacks and responding to your opponent's threats.</p> 

<p>Two main types of mating patterns exist:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>back rank</strong> mate: if the king is against the back rank, he has only 5 moves left he could make, which makes it easier to checkmate him. Most players use two rooks to drive the enemy king towards the back rank (by constantly checking him).</li>
	<li>The <strong>double direction </strong>mate: attacking the king from multiple directions at the same time. This means that one piece attacks <strong>diagonally</strong> (bishop, queen or pawn), and another attacks <strong>straight</strong> (queen or rook). You can use this to constantly check the king and force it into a corner, where it is then checkmated. If the king has some pieces around it (usually its own pawns), then you don't want to drive it away---he already has limited movement options.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Variations on this are using two different diagonals, or one straight line + one knight. These however only work if the king is positioned to the sides of the board.]</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Often though, checkmate comes from a combination of these two.</p>

<p>Let me give you some examples to make these concepts more clear. Most of these are named after their inventors or points of origin. Also note that these mating patterns don't always come in the ideal way (actually, they generally don't), which means you must train yourself to recognize opportunities and force the opponent to the spot you want him to be.</p>

<h2>Back Rank Mate</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessBackRankMate.png" /></p>

<p>Quite simply, this is by far the most common way to checkmate. If you have an advantage of one or two pieces, you can usually safely bring one or two pawns to the other side of the board for promotion. Then, if you have two rooks, or a rook and a queen, you can move them closer to the king, one by one, to eventually checkmate your opponent.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Anderssen's Mate</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessAnderssenMate.png" /></p>

<p>This pattern is to be used specifically when the opponent has castled, and has a weak pawn structure on the kingside. You can't really force the opponent to castle, but most players do it as quickly as possible anyway, which makes this a very useful pattern to know. If the king still has its three pawns in front of him, you can destroy it with a sacrifice---attacking with a valuable piece which the opponent can't resist to take with his pawns.</p>

<p>NOTE: Putting a bishop on the long diagonal is almost always a good idea, as it runs through the centre, while still keeping the bishop relatively safe.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Morphy's Mate</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessMorphyMate.png" /></p>

<p>This pattern is more or less a variation on the Anderssen's mate. The king is castled and behind some pawns, but this time the middle one has to be somewhere else or captured. This means that the king is checkmated on g8 instead of h8.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Morphy's Mate with Knight</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessMorphyKnightMate.png" /></p>

<p>Instead of a rook and bishop, it uses a queen (which can move both diagonally and straight), which is covered by a knight. The knight is an ideal piece, because it can't be attacked by any pieces directly surrounding the king, while it does provide two guarded squares close to the king. It depends a bit on the king's position if you need to move your queen to the other guarded square after the initial check.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Greco's Mate</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessGrecoMate.png" /></p>

<p>The last of three mating patterns for a castled king with weak pawn line. This time, the king is on h8, and has lost his pawns on the f and h file. The pawn on g7 is crucial for this mate, and can't be any other piece---that piece would be able to interfere with the rook's attack towards the king.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Greco's Mate with Knight</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessGrecoKnightMate.png" /></p>

<p>As the title implies, this pattern uses a knight to effectively block off three straight squares, much like the rook did in Greco's mate. There need to be two pawns or pieces in front of the king, to the right, which can't capture the knight or move in such a way that they stand between the bishop and the king. Remember that we're talking about <em>certain</em> mating patterns here, so the opponent should not in any way be able to solve the problem on his side.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Damanio's Mate</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessDamaniosMate.png" /></p>

<p>The picture is just one example of this pattern. If the king is at any position on the back rank, you can place a (<em>guarded</em>) queen right in front of him, and he will be checkmated. Again, realize that---just as any pattern---this queen represents both diagonal and straight lines working together to checkmate.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Anastasia's Mate</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessAnastasiaMate.png" /></p>

<p>One of the trickier mates. The king needs to be pushed toward the edge of the board, with the final blow delivered by a rook on the same line. The knight can block off two of the three remaining moves, but not all of them---there will have to be a pawn or piece there.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Arabian Mate</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessArabianMate.png" /></p>

<p>A variation on Anastasia's mate, requiring a slightly different position of the king (and not necessarily any other enemy piece). The knight is placed in such a way that it can guard a rook on h7, and at the same time block off movement in the other straight direction. The diagonal movement is blocked by the closely placed rook.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Blackburne's Mate</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessBlackburneMate.png" /></p>

<p>This pattern needs very convenient circumstances, but in a game with no heavy pieces (rooks or queen) it can make all the difference. It requires two bishops, a king pushed towards the corner, and one pawn behind which he can take shelter.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Boden's Mate</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessBodenMate.png" /></p>

<p>Also works with two bishops, but requires an additional rook on your side. The advantage though, is that it allows more enemy pieces surrounding the king.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Smothered Mate</h2>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessSmotheredMate.png" /></p>

<p>A pattern that often requires a sacrifice. The pieces blocking off the king's movement don't have to be a rook and two pawns---they can be anything that can't capture the knight.</p>

  title: "[Chess] Positional Play"
  post: "<p>Positional play in chess is one of the main skills that separates the grandmasters from the regular chess players. Most people are inclined to get their pieces forward as fast as possible, and launch assaults on the opponent's most precious pieces. While this can be the way to go against an inexperienced player, a trained one will quickly find weaknesses in your defence and exploit them before you know it.</p> 

<p>That's when this concept of "positional play" steps in, which is based on only one single, very true principle.</p>

<h2>The Positional Principle</h2>

<p><img src="media/ChessPositionalPlay.png" /></p>

<p>Remember this:</p>

> <em>Move that one of your pieces, which is in the worst plight, unless you can satisfy yourself that you can derive immediate advantage by an attack.</em>

<p>These words were said by Adolf Anderssen (that guy from that first mating pattern from previous chapter), and should be the first thing in your decision making process.</p>

<p>When it's your turn, there's two things you can do: attack or defend. If you can convince yourself that attacking is by far the best way to go, you should do it. If the opponent just captured one of your pieces or threatens to do so, attack the piece and/or resolve this problem. But, if those are not the case, you should switch your mind-set towards positional play.</p>

<p>And positional play is nothing more than finding the <strong>weakest link</strong> in your defence, and moving it to a <strong>better position</strong>. Maybe there's a rook just sitting behind some other pieces, restricted in its movement and defending absolutely nothing. Or maybe one of your knights is in a dangerous position it doesn't need to be in. Go over all of your pieces, and see which ones are doing the least or are in the gravest danger if not moved. Then find a better home for them.</p>

<h2>Applying the Positional Principle</h2>

<p>There are three things you can do to improve a piece's position:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Improve placement. </strong>Some suggestions:

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Make it threaten/attack the centre</li>
		<li>Move it out of a dead spot into one it could defend or attack</li>
		<li>Rob the opponent of certain (double) attack strategies (like a fork or pin) by moving the piece out of harm's way and back into your own defensive system</li>
		<li>Reduce the amount of "safe squares" the opponent has.</li>
		<li>Reduce the value of an enemy piece by closing off its attacking lines.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Apply pressure on a weakness</strong> in your opponent's defence.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>A loose piece, a lonely pawn---any enemy piece that is in a bad position. Do note that this is positional play, which means you merely have to <em>threaten it</em>. If a piece is doing nothing, you can increase its value by making it attack anything, even a heavily guarded piece. Because from that moment on, this threat will make decisions for your opponent harder.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Aid in an</strong> (upcoming or already begun) <strong>attack</strong>.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>If you look multiple moves ahead and see the opportunity for a brilliant attacking combination, you want to start with getting all your pieces ready and involved in this attack. Simply moving your rook a few squares without attacking anything will seem harmless to your opponent, while it might be the essential step in checkmating him.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>From this you can conclude that a piece has a bad position if it cannot participate in the game---defence and offence. We call such a piece an <strong>inactive piece</strong>.</p>

<p>You want to only have <strong>active pieces</strong>, because if one piece stands badly, the whole game stands badly.</p>

<p>These three options will be further explained in the next few sections.</p>

<h2>Controlling the Centre</h2>

<p><img src="media/ChessControlTheCentre.png" /></p>

<p>This is a recurring theme throughout this chess course, and for a good reason. Pieces and pawns in the centre have the most attacking possibilities, which means that the person that controls the centre has a very high chance of winning. A good pawn game usually is decisive in these matters, which you can read about in the <em>pawn structure</em> section.</p>

<p>If you can move a piece in such a way that it can be placed safely in the centre, or such that it can attack the centre if necessary, you should almost always do it.</p>

<h2>Strong &amp; Weak Squares</h2>

<p><img src="media/ChessStrongWeakNeutralSquares.png" /></p>

<p>Every square on the board has a value for you: <em>weak, neutral </em>&amp; <em>strong</em>.</p>

<p>A <strong>weak </strong>square is one that is controlled by your opponent, a <strong>strong</strong> square is one that is controlled by you, and a <strong>neutral</strong> square is one that is empty and under no influence of any kind by both players.</p>

<p>When I say controlled, I mean that there's either a piece able to attack the square, or a guarded piece occupies it. If the piece that occupies it is not guarded, it is actually a weakness of yours that the opponent can take advantage of.</p>

<p>Things get nasty when multiple pieces from both players want to control the same square. Generally, the square is then said to belong to the one with the most pieces attacking it (e.g. 2 knights against one). But, say a square is controlled by a pawn. It would then be foolish to attack it with two rooks, because a rook is 5 points and a pawn only 1, so in that case the square is still considered strong for the player with the pawn.</p>

<p><em>What can I do with this information?</em> Your objective with positional play is to create as many strong squares for yourself. Leaving neutral squares in the process is okay---it's the weak ones you have to watch out for. Moving a piece therefore should always upgrade a weak or neutral square, to a neutral or strong one respectively.</p>

<h2>Open &amp; Closed Lines</h2>

<p><img src="media/ChessOpenClosedLines.png" /></p>

<p>The three most valuable pieces---Bishop, Rook and Queen---all move in a straight line, as many squares as they want. When they have that freedom, they are deadly. But if they don't, even pawns can inflict more damage.</p>

<p>If you can move a piece that's doing nothing into the path of one of those heavy pieces, you have greatly increased its position (make sure that piece is guarded though).</p>

<p>On the other hand, you shouldn't let the opponent block your valuable pieces. A good positional move would be to place a piece in such a way that the opponent can't get near the lines of attack of your heavy pieces.</p>

<h2>The King's Role</h2>

<p>During the three different stages of the game, the king takes on a different role. Because the king must be protected and has limited attacking powers, using your king well has everything to do with positional play.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Opening:</strong> During the opening you should never move your king or make it possible for the opponent to check it. You want to bring out all your other pieces, and then castle your king into safety.</li>
	<li><strong>Midgame:</strong> Still, your king is safe and it should stay that way. Your other pieces are strengthening the defence and fighting off the enemy, your king should not be used as a piece to guard anything, nor should it (or the pawns in front of him for that matter) change position.</li>
	<li><strong>Endgame:</strong> There's less pieces left on the board, and that means that the king has just become a lot more valuable. Leaving the king out in the open is a bad idea, not only because it can easily be checkmated, but also because you can use the king to guard the few pieces and pawns you have left. You should change the king's position if you don't have any other piece that can make a greater increase in position or attacking value. Usually, if you can get the king towards the spot where the last few pieces and pawns are fighting it out, you suddenly have an extra piece to guard and possibly attack.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should always take a look at your king, even if you can easily see it is impossible for the opponent to threaten him in any way. If you don't have a better move, increasing the king's position at the right moment and in the right way can make all the difference.</p>

  title: "[Chess] Openings"
  post: "<p>Your opening means everything. It determines what type of game is going to be played, how well you'll be able to develop your pieces, and might even give you a psychological edge over your opponent.</p> 

<p>Theoretically, you could open any way you like---as long as your moves are legal ones. But not every move or sequence of moves is equally strong, which is exactly why certain opening patterns have been created!</p>

<p>Usually, white will choose the style the game is going to be with his <strong>opening</strong> or first move. Black then responds with the appropriate opening himself, which we usually call a <strong>defence</strong>.</p>

<p>There are two (general) styles a game can be in:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Open: </strong>The pawns in the centre of the board have been removed. Even if all other pawns are locked in, this provides a passage for a lot of pieces to move to the other side of the board.</li>
	<li><strong>Closed:</strong> the pawns in the centre of the board are locked in or at least still present, and the sides of the field are also occupied or the files shut off.</li>
</ul>

<p>When choosing an opening it's always a trade-off between security (defence) and possibilities (offence). Opening with your centre pawns and knights will give you control over the centre, but creates vulnerabilities if the enemy attacks via the diagonals. Opening with your knights and pawns on the sides creates less vulnerabilities (there's only some danger coming from a queen or rook attacking on the d or e files), but limits your attacking options considerably. Therefore, choose your opening based on the type of game you want to play.</p>

<p>But, also keep in mind the game your <em>opponent </em>wants to play. Using an opening they don't expect, or that doesn't fit at all with their playing style, gives you a slight psychological advantage.</p>

<p>Anyway, I want to show you the most common and successful openings and defences. They are ordered by winning percentage (first one lead the most wins in professional games, second one a bit less, etcetera), but don't think you should only learn the opening with the best statistics. Different opponents require different openings, and if you play black you should also be able to recognize white's opening and immediately know the appropriate response.</p>

<p>NOTE: Many people exchange pawns, knights and bishops in the opening of the game, thinking '<em>oh well, it is an equal exchange, and I've still got all those other pieces.</em>' Don't. Depending on how the game develops and whether it is an open or closed game, you will need different pieces. For example: In a closed game, only knights can move freely, while open games give your bishops maximum potential.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: While not vital to <em>playing</em> chess, it is useful to learn about how notation for chess games works---every opening here has its sequence of moves written down in the official way. Learn about that in the <strong><em>[Chess] Notation Tutorial</em></strong>.</p>

<h2>Openings for White</h2>

<h5>Queen's Gambit</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningQueensGambit.png" /></p>

<p>1. d4 d5 2. c4</p>

<p>Black can now either accept (capture your pawn) or decline. If he accepts, you'll lose a pawn but gain a great positional advantage (and usually, you win that pawn back). If he declines, you still control the centre.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>English Opening</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningEnglishDefence.png" /></p>

<p>1. c4</p>

<p>A highly successful opening. It still puts pressure on the centre, but also allows for faster piece development.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>King's Indian Attack</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningKingsIndianAttack.png" /></p>

<p>1. e4 &hellip; 2. d3 &hellip; 3. Nd2 &hellip; 4. Ngf3 &hellip; 5. Bg2 &hellip; 0-0</p>

<p>It mostly controls the centre, but also allows for quick castling and a very strong kingside (defensively).</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Ruy Lopez</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningRuyLopez.png" /></p>

<p>1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5</p>

<p>Very popular. It immediately puts pressure on black, while still creating room to castle and controlling some of the centre.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Four Knights Defence</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningFourKnightsDefence.png" /></p>

<p>1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6</p>

<p>A symmetrical opening, which usually creates a defensive and positional game. Both sides are equal after the first three moves, and it will be hard to quickly set up an attack (for black more than for white though).</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Giuoco Piano</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningGiuocoPiano.png" /></p>

<p>1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5</p>

<p>Translated from Italian it means "quiet game". White dominates the centre by preventing any movement from black through it. Black usually tries to exchange pieces to free up the centre---prevent that.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Ponziani Opening</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningPonziani.png" /></p>

<p>1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c3 (<em>Nf6 4. d4</em>)</p>

<p>The main purpose is to create a strong pawn structure, but it also opens up diagonals for white's bishops and queen. His queenside knight is trapped for now though.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Bishop's Opening</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningBishops.png" /></p>

<p>1. e4 e5 2. Bc4</p>

<p>Prevents black from marching into the centre, while leaving the f-pawn unblocked (<em>f4</em> is a common follow-up move) for more centre pressure.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Benko's Opening</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningBenkos.png" /></p>

<p>1. g3</p>

<p>Usually followed up by <em>Bg2</em> and/or <em>Nf3</em>. Creates a very strong kingside defence, while also placing the bishop on its favourite diagonal. Doesn't necessarily do much good for the centre or pawn structure.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Blackmar-Diemer Gambit</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningBlackmarDiemerGambit.png" /></p>

<p>1. d4 d5 2. e4 dxe4 3. Nc3 (<em>&hellip; 4. f3</em>)</p>

<p>Just as with the Queen's gambit, white lets black take a pawn to rapidly develop and activate his pieces. White usually wins back the pawn, as black will have a hard time defending such an advanced pawn in the beginning of the game. A very attacking opening, but risky.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Openings for Black</h2>

<h5>Nimzo-Indian Defence</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningNimzoIndianDefence.png" /></p>

<p>1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4</p>

<p>A flexible defence that wants to force double pawns on White's side early in the game.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Pirc Defence</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningPircDefence.png" /></p>

<p>1. e4 d6 2. &hellip; Nf6 (<em>3. &hellip; g6 4. &hellip; Bg7</em>)</p>

<p>Black allows white the centre and plays via the flanks. With good support, it can then even launch attacks on the centre from there.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Sicilian Defence</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningSicilianDefence.png" /></p>

<p>1. e4 c5</p>

<p>Black plays for the advantage, but has to watch out that it doesn't fall victim to an early attack from white. Black plays for the centre without giving up kingside security or pawn structure.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>French Defence</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningFrenchDefence.png" /></p>

<p>1. e4 e6</p>

<p>Creates a cramped and restricted game for black in the early stages, but black gains counterattacking possibilities on the queenside. White will most likely focus on the kingside.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Alekhine Defence</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningAlekhineDefence.png" /></p>

<p>1. e4 Nf6</p>

<p>A very attacking and aggressive move. It temps White's pawn(s) forward, trying to trap them and undermine the structure later.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Robatsch Defence</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningRobatschDefence.png" /></p>

<p>1. e4 g6</p>

<p>Black allows white to occupy the centre at first, but will later seriously threaten it with moves like <em>Bg7</em> and/or <em>Nf6</em>.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Nimzowitsch Defence</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningNimzowitschDefence.png" /></p>

<p>1. e4 Nc6</p>

<p>Same idea as the Robatsch defence---white is allowed to play freely in the centre, but black will later on try to make the whole structure crumble with well-timed pawn advances and annoying knights.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Caro-Kann Defence</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningCaroKannDefence.png" /></p>

<p>1. e4 c6</p>

<p>A relatively surprising way for black to open. It sets up a good pawn structure near the centre, but constrains the knight and bishop. Usually leads to highly positional games.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Dutch Defence</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningDutchDefence.png" /></p>

<p>1. d4 f6</p>

<p>If the opponent can't handle it, it is very good and leads to beautiful games. If the opponent does know exactly how to deal with it, you're going to have a hard time. Half of the players praise this opening, the others criticize it.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h5>Slav Defence</h5>

<p><img class="floatingBodyImage" src="media/ChessOpeningSlavDefence.png" /></p>

<p>1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6</p>

<p>Originally invented as one of the best ways to decline a Queen's Gambit. Very popular among grandmasters.</p>

<div class="floatingBodyClear"> </div>

<h2>Remember&hellip;</h2>

<p>These are not all openings. Not even close.</p>

<p>And although they are sorted based on statistics and winning percentages, there is no single best opening. You choose your opening based on your opponent and the type of game you want to play.</p>

<p>Analyse the opening of every opponent you run into, and always check the role your opening played in winning/losing/drawing a game. Learn new openings or variations regularly.</p>

  title: "[Chess] Pawn Structure"
  post: "<p>A grandmaster of Chess once said "pawns are the <em>soul</em> of the game." Not queens, not the king, not any heavy piece---he was full of pawns. Of course, you have 8 of them, and they are at the front of the battlefield, but why are they so special or important?</p> 

<p>Because they are worth so little, but can do so much. A chain of pawns is the ideal defence, because no player wants to sacrifice their pieces (which are worth more) just to break through. A pawn that reaches the back rank can be promoted to the most valuable piece in the game; the queen. A group of pawns focussed on the centre can seriously limit your opponent's movement options. That's why you should always try to get your pawn structure strong, and the enemy's pawn structure weak and broken.</p>

<p>I'll first introduce the concept of pawn islands, then discuss three types of pawns you <strong>do</strong> want to have, and then two types you generally <strong>don't</strong> want to have.</p>

<p><img src="media/ChessPawnStructure.png" /></p>

<h2>Pawn Islands</h2>

<p>Pawn islands are groups of pawns, isolated from each other. A pawn is isolated if there's no pawn in the 8 squares around it. The rule here is:</p>

> <em>The fewer pawn islands, the better</em>

<p>A group of pawns will always be able to guard each other, or attain such a position within one or two moves. It therefore creates an impenetrable fortress on that part of the board. On the other hand, if a pawn of yours is lonely, it is often unwise and hard to guard it, and will be captured easily. The best pawn structure is one consisting of a maximum of three islands, or where all pawns are <strong>connected </strong>and/or <strong>chained</strong>.</p>

<h2>Connected Pawns</h2>

<p>Pawns are connected if they stand right next to each other. They not only threaten the four squares in front of them, the squares they occupy are also considered <strong>strong squares</strong>. <em>Why? </em>Because if one of them is threatened, it only takes a single move to solve the problem, which is transforming them into <em>chained pawns</em>.</p>

<h2>Chained Pawns</h2>

<p>Chained pawns means that every pawn is defending another, which creates a that starts from the pawn that is most to the front, and ends with one pawn in the heart of your defence.</p>

<p>Chained pawns are weaker than connected ones in the sense that they threaten less squares and leave a diagonal gap. They are stronger than connected ones for their ability to guard each other.</p>

<p>However, always make sure you guard that last pawn in the chain very well. If that one falls, the whole structure crumbles and your defence is almost lost.</p>

<h2>Passed Pawns</h2>

<p>Passed pawns are pawns that won't get into trouble if they walk right into the opponent's defence. There is no enemy pawn on their file or the ones right next to it. An opponent will rarely sacrifice a piece for a pawn, which means passed pawns are relatively safe and can do a lot of damage if used properly.</p>

<h2>Double Pawns</h2>

<p>We speak of double pawns if there is more than one pawn (from you) on the same file. This can happen over the course of the game when a pawn captures something.</p>

<p>Double pawns are <em>dreadful</em>, because the pawn at the back is seriously blocked by the one in the front. They also leave vertical gaps in your defence and the back pawn is usually rendered useless.</p>

<p>The only upside is if you have double pawns in the centre, or within the opponent's half of the board. There they can wreak havoc with the four squares they threaten.</p>

<h2>Isolated Pawns</h2>

<p>Isolated pawns are lonely pawns. They can't receive support from your other pawns (because they are more than one file away), but they also can't just walk through your opponent's defence because he/she <em>does</em> have a pawn that can block it. You <strong>don't</strong> want to have those, as it usually means somewhere during the game you will lose that pawn, and won't be able to gain anything from it.</p>

<h2>Pawn Majorities</h2>

<p>In the endgame, having a <strong>pawn majority</strong> becomes very important. If you have more pawns than your opponent at the kingside/queenside, you can simply burst through their pawn structure by force. This weakens the opponent's defence, and if you're lucky you can promote your leftover pawns or use them for checkmate.</p>

<p>In general, you want to keep your pawn structure strong and intact during the opening and middle game. But, if you find a way to safely advance your pawn into enemy territory, you should do it. An advanced pawn can restrict the opponent's options and aid in devastating attacks.</p>

<p>Also, timing is crucial in advancing your pawns. If you start the game by advancing all of them you might create an intricate pawn structure, but there's a lot of space behind it and not much to guard the weakest links in the chain. Only advance a pawn if it can be done safely, which sometimes means one or two pawns enter the game very, very late.</p>

  title: "[Chess] Light-Dark Square Tactic"
  post: "<p>I thought about this for a long time, about whether to include it in a fundamentals Chess course. It is a quite advanced and detailed strategy, but I eventually decided it was important enough to mention the topic.</p> 

<p><strong>Light</strong> and <strong>Dark</strong> squares simply refer to the colour of the squares---white and black.  A lot of pieces on the board can move or capture diagonally, and one important thing to notice is that moving like that you <strong>always</strong> stay on squares of the same colour! A pawn on a light square, will only be able to capture or guard pieces on light squares. A bishop on a light square will stay on the light squares for the rest of the game. If you're able to restrict horizontal and vertical movement, the queen will also only move through squares of the same colour.</p>

<p>Conversely, a knight always alternates between <em>light</em> and <em>dark</em> squares. If he's on a light square, any move will bring him to a dark one, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Because of those close relationships between pieces and the colour of the squares they are on, you can use this information to your advantage.</p>

<p><img src="media/ChessLightDarkSquareTactic.png" /></p>

<h2>Defensive</h2>

<p>Especially near and during the endgame, the light-dark square tactic is important. If your opponent has pieces that work (mainly) diagonally, you can remove all of their use by placing your own pawns, king and perhaps other pieces strategically.</p>

<p>If you create a pawn chain on the dark squares, and put your king on a light square, the dark-squared bishop can't do anything. If you place a bishop running through the centre early on in the game, it will be very hard for your opponent to build and develop---the only pieces that can cross that diagonal line are the rooks, and they are still locked in their position. If you place your knights just outside the centre and on two squares of different colour, you are able to jump to and defend any colour in case of an attack.</p>

<p>If the opponent builds their attack diagonally, your rooks are of no use, and may even work against you. If you have focused your defence on the right colour, your rooks should be the pieces preventing the opponent from attacking via the other one.</p>

<h2>Offensive</h2>

<p>The advantage of the light-dark square tactic is mainly offensive though.</p>

<p>First of all, there are so-called <strong>bad bishops</strong>. Those are bishops that can't really do anything because the squares of their colour are occupied or threatened. A bad bishop will usually stay bad for a very long time, and it is a good idea to exchange it for the <strong>good bishop</strong> of your opponent. The good bishop is the one that can move freely, and that is on the same colour as your king. You don't want to run into an early check and have to move your king (and perhaps lose a piece). If that's not possible, exchange it with a knight.</p>

<p>Secondly, the strongest attacks are usually along one colour. Open diagonals can be exploited very easily, and are the only big weakness if your opponent has a good pawn structure. The only way you could get lots of pieces gracefully working together is by focusing solely on one colour.</p>

  post: "<p>There you have it: the fundamentals of Chess! You should by now know the rules, openings, basic tactics and a few advanced strategies. Now the only way to become even better is to <em>play </em>a lot, and maybe even <em>analyse games</em> a lot.</p> 

<p>Playing games you can experiment with new ideas and learn how to play against all the different types of opponents you'll ever meet.

	<li><strong>On Sacrifices. </strong>A sacrifice is when you let the opponent capture one of your pieces without recapturing, to gain a positional advantage and maybe even a sure-fire way for a checkmate. However, don't think that sacrifices are magical unicorns that will always help your game. Only make a sacrifice if you are absolutely sure you are going to gain from it what you have in mind (or maybe even better). If you're not sure, you'll have sacrificed your piece for nothing 99% of the times.</li>
	<li>For this reason: don't take an enemy piece without looking at the consequences. Maybe he made a bad move, maybe he's making a brilliant sacrifice.</li>
	<li>Before moving a piece, see what it defends and what it prevents. Sometimes, one of your pieces is preventing an attack without you knowing it, and moving it will let your opponent loose. Also, make sure you don't provide the opponent with an opportunity to place a double attack. Always.</li>
	<li>Develop knights before bishops. This is simply a logical insight: bishops are hidden behind a wall of pawns at the start of a game. Knights can get into the game and control the centre in one single move. It is therefore,<em> most of the times, </em>better to start with bringing your knights out.</li>
	<li>Learn to think multiple moves ahead. If you only think one step ahead, your opponent won't have to go further either, and will always see through all your plans.</li>
	<li>Learn to view the game from your opponent's POV. What does he want? Why does he do this particular move? What is he threatening? What does he think I want?</li>
	<li>If you have finally achieved a winning position, don't let it slip away! Don't sit back and relax, don't start toying with your opponent---one wrong move and you have lost the game.</li>
	<li><strong>The first move disadvantage.</strong> Don't be the one starting an (equal) exchange, unless you can gain a great positional or tactical advantage from it. Let the opponent come---he will waste one move on starting the exchange. For example, say your opponent places his bishop in such a way that he is threatening your bishop. You could then use your move to exchange bishops, but that's probably what your opponent is hoping for. If your opponent wants to exchange anyway, let him do that in his own time and not yours.</li>

  title: "[Chess] Game Notation"
  post: "<p>In order to transcribe or analyse games, you have to know how to write down chess games in the correct form.</p>

<p>I am going to assume you are familiar with the several pieces, and the fact that the columns of the board are named <strong>a---g</strong>, and the rows are numbered <strong>1---8</strong>.</p> 

<p>The basic structure is like this:</p>

> <which turn>. <white's move> <black's move>

> 1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. &hellip;

<p>Basically, every turn is seen as a pair of two moves---one from white and one from black. Because both players always alternate turns, this format can continue perfectly until the end of the game.</p>

<p>As you can see from the example, the most important part of notation is of course what square the piece is moved towards. But, we also want to know which piece is being moved. For that, an extra letter is added at the front:</p>

> <strong>N</strong> for the knight, <strong>B</strong> for bishop, <strong>R</strong> for rook, <strong>Q</strong> for queen, <strong>K </strong>for king. Pawns have no letter in front.

> <em>Why the N for the knight?</em> Because the K was already taken by the more important King.

> <em>Why nothing in front of the pawn?</em> Because pawns are moved the most, and leaving out a prefix for these pieces speeds up the notation process considerably.

<p>Furthermore, there are cases where for multiple pieces of the same type (e.g. two knights) could have moved to that square. In those cases, we also include the file of the starting square in front of the end square.</p>

> N<strong>d</strong>e5 means the knight on the d file moved to e5, <strong>c</strong>d6 means the pawn from the c file moved to d6.

> If both pieces are on the same file, we just include the whole square (N<strong>d3</strong>e5).

<p>And lastly, there are some symbols to clarify the state of the game:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An <strong>x </strong>in front of the target square means the piece <em>captured</em> something. (c<strong>x</strong>d6)</li>
	<li>A <strong>+ </strong>behind the target square means the opponent is in <em>check</em> after this move. (Ne5<strong>+</strong>)</li>
	<li>A <strong>#</strong> behind the target square means the opponent is <em>checkmated</em>. (Qf6<strong>#</strong>)</li>
	<li><strong>O-O </strong>means the player castled <em>kingside</em>, <strong>O-O-O</strong> means castling <em>queenside</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it!</p>

<p>Some extra notes: in game analysis, people often use an<strong> !</strong> (e.g. Qf6<strong>!</strong>) to emphasize a move, meaning it was very important to the game, and a <strong>?</strong> if they seriously question a player's move/decision. The combination of the two (<strong>!?</strong>) expresses that the person that analysed the game thought that move was absolutely bonkers.</p>

  title: "Guide to English Grammar"
  post: "<p>English is <em>the</em> language of the world. At the time of writing, English has 1500 million speakers worldwide, and it's growing rapidly as the first language of the world wide web. Learning the basics of the English language therefore enables you to communicate with nearly everyone all over the globe, whether you are writing a blog, giving presentations, or just want to explore other cultures. On top of that, learning a new language enhances your cognitive abilities.</p> 

<p>This tutorial, however, is in English (as you might have noticed), which means you should already have at least some experience with <em>reading</em> English. Because of that, this guide is mainly focused on the grammar rules and principles, and gives few examples or exercises. It's certainly complete, but it doesn't even come close to an actual (college/high school) <em>course</em> or <em>textbook</em>. You should see this as something you read one time to iron out your grammar mistakes and learn the rules and their exceptions---and then use it as a reference when you're in doubt using English for something.</p>

<p>Anything concerning <em>punctuation</em> or <em>quotes/dialogue</em> doesn't belong here (in my opinion), and is discussed in the <strong><em>writing with style</em></strong> tutorial. I recommend you read that after you've explored this course---this course teaches you the fundamentals of the language, while the other one improves your writing with added elegance and fluency.</p>

<p>Last but not least: the English language has become famous for its (relatively) easy grammar, but expansive vocabulary. There are often lots of ways to say a certain thing, lots of synonyms for one concept, but only a few grammar rules (sometimes only a single rule) you need to know for every verb tense. That's why I think it is really important to study the grammar and remember it well, because it isn't much, but still gives you a complete understanding of the language. Vocabulary comes from a lot of reading, listening and writing.</p>

<p>With that out of the way: have fun with this course, and I hope you will find it useful!</p>

  title: "[English] Sentence Structure"
  post: "<p>A sentence is a meaningful set of words. A sentence is the smallest standalone piece of text that conveys meaning. To structure these words in such a way that anybody can understand exactly what they are trying to say, is called using <em>grammar</em>. Grammar takes to what group a word belongs (nouns, pronouns, adjectives, etcetera) and uses that to determine where and how it should be written. The first step to crafting beautiful sentences is knowing the structure every single one of them uses, and how simple or 'obvious' it may seem, I want to use some of your time to discuss it a little here.</p> 

<h2>Subject and Verb</h2>

<p>These are the life of every line. The subject is what or who is doing something, and verb describes what action that person or thing is performing. In order for a sentence to work, it needs to contain at least some action. Something happening, some progress, some new event.</p>

> <em>The man eats</em>

<p><strong>The man</strong> is the subject, the one doing something. What he does is <strong>eat</strong>ing, the verb. If you create a sentence and can't find the subject and/or verb, something went wrong.</p>

<p>Usually, the subject comes before the verb. They even appear together at the start of the sentence most of the times, but certainly not always.</p>

<h2>Direct and Indirect Object</h2>

<p>If you want to expand your sentence with more details, meaning or an extra twist, (in)direct objects are the first things you will want to add.</p>

<p><strong>Direct Object</strong>: the person or thing receiving the action, the subject's 'victim'.</p>

> <em>The man eats <strong>the apple</strong></em>

> <em>The girl is watching <strong>a movie</strong></em>

<p><strong>Indirect Object:</strong> the person or thing participating in the action. The verb is not directly targeting it, but they tell for or to whom the direct object is meant. It describes the <em>secondary goal</em> of an action.</p>

> <em>The man gives the apple to <strong>the boy</strong></em>

> <em>The man gave <strong>his daughter</strong> a book </em>(can be rewritten to <em>the man gave a book to his daughter</em>)

> <em>Let <strong>him</strong> have it</em>

<h2>Relative and Subordinate Clauses</h2>

<p>For even more complex or detailed sentences, you can add relative or subordinate clauses.</p>

<p><strong>Relative Clauses: </strong>say something about the subject, providing details or specifics.</p>

> <em>The man, <strong>who visited me when I was sick</strong>, wears a hat </em> 

<p><strong>Subordinate Clauses:</strong> a small sub sentence---a sentence within a sentence. The subordinate clause adds a second action to the sentence, with its own subject and verb.</p>

> <em>The man eats the apple, <strong>while the girls eat chips.</strong></em>

<h2>Details and Modifiers</h2>

<p>Of course there will be moments where you need to include more details to make a sentence clear. There are a few ways to achieve this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Specifying nouns => <em>The<strong> white</strong> cat is eating the <strong>red</strong> apple.</em></li>
	<li>Modifying verbs => <em>The woman stared <strong>intensely</strong></em>. <em>The boy jumped <strong>wildly</strong></em></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that by modifying verbs you basically answer the question <em>how?</em> - How did the subject perform the action? Intensely, wildly, gently, etcetera.</p>

<p>The other questions you could answer are the <strong>5 W's </strong>and <strong>H</strong>: <em>Who? What? When? Where? Why?</em> <em>How? </em>For answering these you can use multiple techniques and constructions, which will all be discussed throughout the course.</p>

> <em>Peter hit frank</em> => When did Peter hit Frank? => <strong><em>Yesterday,</em></strong><em> Peter hit Frank</em>

> <em>The cat jumped </em>=> Where did the cat jump to? (What did the cat jump on?) => <em>The cat jumped <strong>on the box</strong></em>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This course will start with explaining everything about nouns and verbs. This enables you to create all basic sentences, and creates a good base for you to build upon. Then all the ways to add details and modifiers are discussed.</p>

  title: "[English] Nouns"
  post: "<p>Nouns, together with verbs, are the basic building blocks of every language. In some languages, nouns take on different shapes and suffixes depending on their role or position within the sentence---but, luckily, not in English. Nouns stay almost exactly the same all the time, and there are only a few basic (and a few specific) rules I need to discuss here.</p> 

> <strong><em>Nouns</em></strong><em> give names to people, animals, places or things</em>.

> <strong><em>Examples: </em></strong><em>man, girl, apple, England, rabbit, house, March</em>

<h2>Gender</h2>

<p>In general, nouns don't have a gender. A <em>dog</em> doesn't have a specified gender, nor does a <em>house</em> or <em>chair</em>. Therefore, you usually don't have to worry about changing a noun based on gender. If you want to specify gender (for clarity), you can put <em>male</em> or <em>female</em> in front (<em>a male friend, a female student</em>).</p>

<p>There are some cases though, with people and animals, where you <em>must</em> use different words for different genders. A gender-neutral word---only to be used if the gender really doesn't matter or is unknown---is also sometimes available. Some of the more common ones are:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Masculine</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Feminine</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Neutral</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Man</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Woman</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Person</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Father</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Mother</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Parent</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Waiter</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Waitress</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Server</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Husband</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Wife</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Spouse</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Boy</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Girl</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Child</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p> </p>

<p>When referring to an essentially gender-neutral noun used earlier in your story, it is always allowed to use <strong>it</strong> or <strong>they</strong>. But, if you want to express familiarity with the subject, you can actively assign a gender to the noun.</p>

> <em>This is my boat. I love <strong>it</strong> very much.</em>

> <em>This is my boat. I love <strong>her</strong> very much.</em>

<h2>Singular</h2>

<p>If you refer to one specific noun, you use <strong>the</strong> in front of it.</p>

> <em>The man, the girl</em>

<p>If you refer to something or someone in a general way, you use <strong>a</strong>. If the noun starts with a <em>vowel sound</em> (phonetically, it starts with a vowel, excluding y), you use <strong>an</strong> to prevent creating a sentence that's impossible to pronounce.</p>

> <em>A man, an apple, a university, an honour</em>

<h2>Plural</h2>

<p>When you refer to a multiple of the noun, you omit any article and put the noun in <em>plural form</em>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Plurals are formed by adding an <strong>---s</strong> at the end: <em>house<strong>s</strong>, cat<strong>s</strong>, boy<strong>s</strong></em>.</li>
	<li>A singular noun ending in <strong>s, z, x, ch, sh</strong> needs the suffix <strong>---es</strong>: <em>wish<strong>es</strong>, fox<strong>es</strong>, bus<strong>es</strong></em>.</li>
	<li>If it ends in <strong>---y</strong>, the<em> y</em> is replaced with <strong>---ies</strong>: <em>baby -> bab<strong>ies</strong>, city -> cit<strong>ies</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's also a large list of irregular plurals in English, but the best way to remember these is reading a lot. Some important ones are included here:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Singular</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Plural</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Singular</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Plural</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Woman</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Women</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Man</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Men</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Child</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Children</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Tooth</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Teeth</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Foot</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Feet</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Person</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>People</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Fish</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Fish</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Sheep</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Sheep</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Wife</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Wives</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Mouse</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Mice</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p> </p>

<p>And lastly, a few nouns exist that are only used in plural form or acquire a different meaning when used as a singular noun. Examples are:</p>

> <em>His <strong>trousers</strong> are black</em>

> <em>The <strong>news</strong> is always at 8 o'clock. </em>

<h2>Countable &amp; Uncountable</h2>

<p>A very important and useful way to divide nouns into two groups: countable and uncountable.</p>

<p><strong>Countable</strong> nouns can be counted. They have a singular and plural form, and you can put a number in front of them.</p>

> <em>Two dogs, five men, a child.</em>

<p><strong>Uncountable</strong> nouns on the other hand have only one form---singular and plural at the same time. They are often abstract things or concepts. You can't put a number in front of them.</p>

> <em>Money, tea, bread, knowledge, love</em>

<p>Whether a noun is countable or not will be important especially later on when we look at adjectives and determiners.</p>

<h2>Possessive</h2>

<p>A noun can belong to someone or something. That's when you need to use the possessive form to show that relation. You can do that by putting <strong>'s</strong> (apostrophe s) behind the noun and before the thing it owns.</p>

> <em>John<strong>'s</strong> car, France<strong>'s</strong> army, men<strong>'s</strong> clothes, Mark<strong>'s</strong> patience.</em>

<p>If the noun ends in an <strong>---s</strong> or <strong>---x</strong>, you can show a possessive relationship by using an apostrophe only.</p>

> <em>Jess<strong>'</strong> smartphone, girls<strong>'</strong> room.</em>

<p>This is to prevent a lot of <em>sss</em> sounds after each other, but it is not required. Actually, the apostrophe can easily be missed on its own (by the reader), so it's recommended to not use this form.</p>

<h2>Compound</h2>

<p>English has a large vocabulary, but there are still cases where you need to combine two words to get the meaning you want. A lot of these <em>compound nouns</em> are very common and have found their way into the language as <em>the way</em> to say something, some of these are rarely seen or you can form yourself in case you need them.</p>

<p>Two words can be connected to each other, unless a problem could occur---the word could be read I the wrong way or mispronounced. In those cases, a space is added in between. If the word then can still be understood the wrong way, a <em>hyphen </em>is put between the two separate words.</p>

> <em>Police + man</em> = policeman

> <em>Boy + friend </em>= boyfriend

> <em>Water + tank </em>= water tank

> <em>Washing + machine</em> = washing machine

> <em>Train + spotting</em> = train-spotting

> <em>Off + campus = </em>off-campus

<p>The rules however or not exact here, and you should consult a dictionary if you're not sure (or go with whatever sounds and looks best in your case).</p>

<h2>Capitalization &amp; Nationalities</h2>

<p>A noun is capitalized (starts with an uppercase letter) if it is</p>

<ul>
	<li>The first word of the sentence</li>
	<li>The first personal pronoun; I
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><strong><em>I</em></strong><em> went to school today.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A month, day, season or holiday
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>The first day of <strong>M</strong>arch is a <strong>M</strong>onday.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A name or title. This includes names of streets, buildings, oceans, cities, regions, etcetera.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>In <strong>C</strong>alifornia. The people of <strong>L</strong>ondon. The water in the <strong>A</strong>tlantic. The <strong>H</strong>imalayas.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A language, nationality or adjective relating to nationality.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>He lives in <strong>C</strong>hina. The <strong>F</strong>rench food was tasty. He speaks <strong>E</strong>nglish. They are <strong>J</strong>apanese. <strong>S</strong>paniards are handsome.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The names for countries, their language, and their corresponding adjective can differ a lot and are very irregular. You can say: <em>in England live Englishmen, they speak English and drink English tea</em>. But for another country this would become: <em>in Spain live Spaniards, they speak Spanish and drink Spanish wine. </em>Or: <em>in Holland live Dutchmen, they speak Dutch and make Netherlandish art</em>.</p>

  title: "[English] Pronouns"
  post: "<p>Pronouns are actually more of a small subset of the large group of nouns, but because of their importance, and large amount of words you need to remember correctly, they deserve their own chapter. The type of pronoun you have to use depends on the noun it replaces (or 'refers to'), and the function that noun has within the sentence. They can therefore not always be used---but, if there's a possibility to use them instead of longer or more complicated nouns, that opportunity should always be seized.</p> 

> <strong><em>Pronouns</em></strong><em> replace nouns. They are shorter words, referring back to a noun used earlier in the sentence or paragraph. They avoid repetition and make sentences shorter and clearer. </em>

> <strong><em>Examples: </em></strong><em>Paul saw <strong>something</strong> in the dark, it was <strong>his</strong> shadow.</em>

<h2>Subject Pronouns</h2>

<p>You use this pronoun if it is the subject of the sentence:</p>

> <strong><em>You</em></strong><em> eat an apple. <strong>I</strong> like that.</em>

<h2>Object Pronouns</h2>

<p>You use this form if it is the (direct or indirect) object of the sentence:</p>

> <em>He sent the letter to <strong>me</strong>. The man eats the apple for <strong>them</strong>.</em>

<h2>Reflexive &amp; Intensive Pronouns</h2>

<p>Reflexive and intensive pronouns are the same words, but fulfil different functions in a sentence.</p>

<p><strong>Reflexive</strong> pronouns are used if the <em>object</em> is the same person or thing as the <em>subject</em>. You're reflecting on something you did to yourself.</p>

> <em>She hit <strong>herself</strong> with a tennis racket. We blame <strong>ourselves</strong> for the failure.</em>

<p><strong>Intensive</strong> pronouns are used if you want to <em>intensify</em> the subject of the sentence. They stress the importance of the subject, but can be removed or left out without changing the meaning of the sentence.</p>

> <em>I baked these cakes <strong>myself</strong>. They <strong>themselves</strong> told me what I did was fine.</em>

<h2>Possessive Pronouns</h2>

<p>These pronouns provide an alternative for showing a possessive relationship between two nouns. We've already seen that you can use an---'s (<em>Jack's house</em>). This pronoun can remove the need to mention Jack again if he is the one talking or he has been mentioned earlier.</p>

> <em>Jack was a nice guy. This house was <strong>his</strong>.</em>

> <em>This candy is <strong>mine</strong>.</em>

<h2>Possessive Adjectives</h2>

<p>They are special: they don't really replace a noun like all pronouns do, but they are very closely related to them. They provide a third alternative for showing a possessive relation: this time, we are putting an adjective, referring to the owner, in front of the noun.</p>

> <em>The dog broke <strong>its</strong> leg. They went to <strong>their</strong> school. I can't find <strong>my</strong> shoes.</em> 

<h2>Indefinite pronouns</h2>

<p>Indefinite pronouns replace a specific or countable noun for one that is vague, broad or uncountable. They can replace a <strong>person, thing</strong> or <strong>place</strong>. They can either refer to <em>all </em>of them, an undefined <em>part </em>of them, or <em>none </em>of them. Which one you should use depends on the type of sentence---affirmative or negative.</p>

<h2>Affirmative</h2>

<p>Affirmative sentences are when something is true (or at least expected to be true). When something is happening, someone is present, etcetera.</p>

> <strong><em>Everybody</em></strong><em> aced that test. <strong>Nobody </strong>is sleeping at the moment. I looked <strong>everywhere</strong> for that book. He thinks it must be <strong>somewhere</strong> around here.</em>

<p>The indefinite pronouns belonging to negative sentences can only be used affirmatively, if they are close to <em>every</em> in their meaning. You should be able to replace 'any' with 'every' in those sentences without changing the meaning.</p>

> <em>You may invite <strong>anyone</strong>. She would give <strong>anything</strong> for that opportunity. </em>

<h2>Negative</h2>

<p>Negative sentences are when something is not true (or you don't expect it to be). It's not happening, not working, not available, not possible.</p>

> <em>He doesn't have <strong>anything</strong> to eat. She hasn't gone <strong>anywhere</strong> the past few months. He couldn't find <strong>anybody</strong> to work with.</em>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>Usually when we ask a question, we are really not sure about the answer, and therefore use <em>any</em> (or <em>every</em>) in almost all questions. The only exceptions are when you already know or highly suspect the answer.</p>

> <em>Did you eat <strong>anything</strong> yesterday? Did you see <strong>anyone</strong> when you were there?</em> (we are really curious)

> <em>Have you lost <strong>something</strong>? Are you looking for <strong>someone</strong>? </em>(we've already seen that someone is searching for something or someone)

<p>We can also <em>negate</em> the sentence---adding or removing the word <em>not</em> in the sentence---if we expect a certain <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em> answer.</p>

> <em>Did<strong>n't </strong>you eat anything yesterday? </em>(we expect a no)

> <em>Have<strong>n't</strong> you lost something?</em> (we expect a yes)

  title: "[English] Prepositions & Conjunctions"
  post: "<p>These two types of words are absolutely crucial to most sentences, but often go unnoticed. You should see this chapter more as a reference for later---don't bother trying to remember all of these if you haven't learnt the more important building blocks of grammar yet. If you find a word in this course you don't understand, you could come here and check it.</p> 

> <strong><em>Prepositions</em></strong><em> are short words connecting verb and object.</em>

> <em>Examples: </em><em>on, after, in, at, for, behind, past, to, through</em>

> <strong><em>Conjunctions</em></strong><em> are short words connecting (parts of) sentences.</em>

> <em>Examples: </em><em>and, but, however, nevertheless</em>

<h2>Prepositions</h2>

<p>A lot of verbs require a specific preposition, or change meaning based on different prepositions belonging to it. There's no rule for this: you learn this from reading proper English a lot. Even native speakers get this wrong sometimes or just don't know the correct form.</p>

<p>A preposition is anything you can put before the noun <strong>the closet</strong> or <strong>the party</strong> in a sentence.</p>

> <em>For example; to the party, after the party, at the party, about the party, etcetera</em>

<p>Always check if you're using the correct preposition, or your sentence might be completely wrong or attain some other (awkward) meaning.</p>

<h2>Conjunctions</h2>

<p>There are 4 types of conjunctions, and I want to show all of them to you here. Not because you will use all of them all the time, but because you need to recognize them and using them will add structure and variation to all your stories.</p>

<h5>Coordinating Conjunctions</h5>

<p>Used to join individual words, phrases and <em>independent</em> clauses (a clause that could be a sentence on its own). Usually placed in the middle of a sentence, and with a comma before it. They are:</p>

> <em>And, but, or, nor, yet, so, for</em>

> <em>Should Me <strong>and</strong> Mike go fishing <strong>or</strong> go swimming? She was sad, <strong>for</strong> her cat just died.</em>

<h5>Subordinating Conjunctions</h5>

<p>Introduce <em>dependant</em> clauses. Usually placed at the front of the clause, and with a comma at the end of that clause. There's a lot of them:</p>

  title: "[English] Verbs I"
  post: "<p>Now that you know everything about nouns, we can start introducing verbs and all their tenses and variations. There are quite a lot of them, but they mostly look alike. The issue therefore is more that you might mix them up and use the wrong tense, than that you could forget how they work or should be formed.</p> 

> <strong><em>Verbs </em></strong><em>describe action</em>

> <strong><em>Examples: </em></strong><em>to run, to walk, to swim, to eat</em>

<h2>Conjugations</h2>

<p>There are only a few conjugations for every verb.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Infinitive:</strong> the way you'll find words in the dictionary.  The full, abstract version of the verb.

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>To think, to see, to eat, to know, to hear</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Regular:</strong> this is the infinitive without 'to'. Mostly used in the simple present and simple future tense.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>I <strong>think</strong>, you <strong>see</strong>, we <strong>eat</strong>, you <strong>know</strong>, I <strong>hear</strong></em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Third-person singular regular:</strong> The third-person singular forms of the regular type, need something extra: an <strong>---s</strong> at the end. Verbs ending in an <strong>---y</strong> (without a vowel in front of the y) are formed by replacing it with <strong>---ies</strong>. Verbs ending in---<strong>ss, -x , -sh, -ch</strong> need an <strong>---es</strong> at the end.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>He think<strong>s</strong>, she see<strong>s</strong>, it eat<strong>s</strong>.</em></li>
		<li><em>To fly => he fl<strong>ies</strong>. To cry => she cr<strong>ies</strong></em></li>
		<li><em>He catch<strong>es</strong>, she fix<strong>es</strong>, it scratch<strong>es</strong>.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Past (participle): </strong>if a verb is regular, the past is formed by adding <strong>---ed</strong> after the regular form. If the verb already ends in an <strong>-e</strong>, only a <strong>---d</strong> is added.  If a verb is irregular, anything could happen really. Irregular verbs also sometimes have another different form for the past participle.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>I laugh<strong>ed</strong>, they jump<strong>ed</strong>, we land<strong>ed</strong>, you hat<strong>ed</strong>.</em></li>
		<li><em>I think => I thought. You see => you saw. We eat => we ate.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Continuous:</strong> this form is used when we want to stress something is happening at the time the sentence is written in. For example, we can say that five hundred years ago a certain event was happen<strong>ing</strong>. Or that in two days something else will be happen<strong>ing</strong>. As you can see, they are simply formed by adding <strong>---ing</strong> at the end of a verb. They are nice, because they are very regular.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Think<strong>ing</strong>, see<strong>ing</strong>, eat<strong>ing</strong>, know<strong>ing</strong>, hear<strong>ing</strong>.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How can you form all those tenses with only this?</em> As you will see, auxiliary verbs are often added.</p>

<h2>Auxiliary Verbs</h2>

<p>These are <em>helping verbs</em>. They can stand on their own, but they are most commonly seen supporting other verbs to create certain tenses. They are quite irregular, but very important to learn:</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Modal Verbs</h2>

<p>Modal verbs are special types of auxiliary verbs. They show an obligation, possibility or necessity. These can't really stand on their own, and always support the actual main verb. They only have a single form that never changes. All modal verbs are:</p>

<table class="styleLessTable">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>can</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><span style="font-weight:normal;">you have the ability to do something</span></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong>could</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><span style="font-weight:normal;">you had the ability sometime in the past</span></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>may</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>you are allowed to do something, or will maybe do it</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong>might</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>you are maybe allowed to something, or could perhaps do it</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>must</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>you are obliged to do something, or it is highly likely it will happen</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong>ought</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>executing the action is the right thing to do, or it is fairly likely/expected to happen</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>should</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			> you strongly advice or insist on doing something
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong>would</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>if you had the possibility/opportunity, you had done it.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><em>Examples: </em></strong><em>You <strong>should </strong>say yes. I know I <strong>would. </strong>You <strong>can</strong> always put it off a few weeks, but you <strong>ought </strong>to at least tell them you're in doubt. You <strong>may</strong> be able to say no, but it <strong>might</strong> turn out worse. You <strong>must</strong> make a decision now!</em></p>

<h2>Contractions &amp; Negations</h2>

<p>All auxiliary and some modal verbs are used very often, and therefore have a special contraction when they are combined with the word <em>not</em>.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p> </p>
			</td>
			<td colspan="2">
			<p>to be</p>

			<p>hadn't</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p> </p>

<p>The modal verbs <em>can, could, must, should </em>and <em>would</em> have their contraction formed by just adding the <strong>---n't </strong>at the end.</p>

> <em>You shouldn't do that. I wasn't ready for this. He just wouldn't tell what happened.</em>

<p>As you can see, if you want to negate a sentence or statement you replace an auxiliary verb by its contraction. If no auxiliary verb is present, you add a contraction of the verb <em>to do</em>.</p>

> <em>I like to walk home => I <strong>don't</strong> like to walk home </em>(regular)

> <em>I walked home yesterday => I <strong>didn't</strong> walk home yesterday </em>(past)

<h2>The Modal Verb '<em>will'</em></h2>

<p>This is a bit of a special one. The word <em>will</em> always indicates an action will take place in the future, and has a large number of meanings and functions (as you will see in the next chapter).</p>

<p>For all people, the word is always written as <strong>will</strong>. I will, you will, they will, etcetera. The negation contraction is always <strong>won't</strong>. If the subject is <strong>I</strong> or <strong>we</strong> you can use <strong>shall</strong> and <strong>shan't</strong> instead, but those are not popular anymore in modern English.</p>

<h2>Contractions for Brevity</h2>

<p>Because of their numerous appearances in English, auxiliary verbs can also contract with the subject if the sentence is <em>affirmative</em> (not negative).</p>

<p><em><strong>Examples:</strong> <strong>I'm</strong> Frank. <strong>I've </strong>always been Frank. When I was young, <strong>I'd</strong> always go fishing in France. <strong>We'd </strong>never thought of moving there though.</em></p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>Questions in English are formed by switching around the subject and auxiliary/modal verb.</p>

> <em>You have seen the news => Have you seen the news?</em>

> <em>He should have done that => Should he have done that?</em>

<p>If no auxiliary/modal verb exists, a form of <strong>to do</strong> is added to the sentence at the beginning.</p>

> <em>I walk down the road => Do I walk down the road?</em>

> <em>They see the chicken => Do they see the chicken?</em>

<p>Answering a question can then be done by using the same auxiliary verb used within the question, using a contraction if the answer is negative.</p>

> <em>Have you seen the news? Yes I have!</em>

> <em>Do you walk down the road? No, I don't.</em>

<p>Using contractions/negations to change question meaning or intention is already discussed in the <em>pronouns</em> chapter.</p>

<p>Knowing all this, we can continue with the actual verb tenses. Do keep in mind that English has a lot of tenses that seem very similar to one in your own language, but are essentially different.</p>

  post: "<p>Instead of grouping verbs by past, present and future, I like to use a different approach here. In English, other types of tenses like the <em>perfect tense</em> or <em>conditional tenses</em> are used much more often, and are perhaps an even more essential part of the language than some of the past/present/future tenses. There's also a significant distinction to be made between tenses that look exactly the same, and that's why I will try to work a little differently by grouping the <em>types of tenses</em> instead of their <em>timing</em>.</p> 

<h2>Simple Tenses</h2>

<p>The simple tense is called that way because it is the simplest of them all when it comes to grammar. When it comes to meaning though, every time has some specific and significant differences that you should know and understand. The simple tense doesn't describe actions as they are happening, but rather general truths, appointments, repeated actions/habits, instructions, etcetera. For example, this tutorial is almost entirely written in the present simple, because they are all general truths and instructions on how to use English.</p>

<h5>Simple Present</h5>

<p>The simple present is constructed by using the <strong>regular</strong> form, and the third-person singular form if the subject is a he/she/it.</p>

> <em>I <strong>work</strong> in Manchester. The exam <strong>starts</strong> at 10 AM. I'll address this issue after I <strong>come</strong> home.</em>

<p>It's used for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Habits, general truths, repeated actions and unchanging situations, emotions, or wishes.</li>
	<li>Giving instructions or directions</li>
	<li>Expressing fixed arrangements/appointments in the present or future.</li>
	<li>Expressing a future time, only after the conjunctions <em>after, before, as soon as, until, when</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Simple Past</h5>

<p>The simple past is constructed by using the <strong>past</strong> form only.</p>

> <em>Her mother <strong>died</strong> last year. We <strong>lived</strong> in Canada in 1985. They <strong>talked</strong> about it yesterday.</em>

<p>It's used for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Something that happened frequently in the past (<em>she often walked home alone</em>)</li>
	<li>A definite point in time (<em>They made the arrangements last week</em>)</li>
	<li>An indefinite point in time (We decided against it <em>long ago</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: If you have a negative sentence, which means adding <strong>didn't</strong> to the sentence, the verb must be in regular form. The auxiliary verb didn't is already in past form.</p>

> <em>Her father <strong>didn't</strong> <strong>die</strong> last year. We <strong>didn't live</strong> in Canada in 1985.</em>

<h5>Simple Future</h5>

<p>The simple future is constructed by using the auxiliary verb <strong>will</strong> + <strong>regular </strong>form.</p>

> <em>He'll never agree. Will you marry me? It will rain tomorrow.</em>

<p>It's used to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Predict a future event.</li>
	<li>Express a spontaneous decision (with <strong>I</strong> or <strong>we</strong>).</li>
	<li>Express willingness. Express unwillingness when negated.</li>
	<li>Make an offer, suggest something or ask for advice/instructions (you must use <strong>shall</strong> then).</li>
	<li>Give orders, when addressing someone or a group directly (with <strong>you</strong>).</li>
	<li>Give an invitation, with <strong>you</strong> in interrogative form (a question).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Continuous Tenses</h2>

<p>The continuous tense describes an action that is happening at the moment of speaking/writing. It describes something that started earlier and is still continuing. In contrast to the simple tense, this is a snapshot of an action happening somewhere in time.</p>

<h5>Continuous Present</h5>

<p>The continuous present is constructed by using a regular form of <strong>to be + continuous</strong> form.</p>

> <em>We are walking. They are talking. I am waiting. You are learning.</em>

<p>Again, to negate the sentence you use a contraction of the <em>to be </em>verb (aren't/isn't).</p>

<p>It's used to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Describe an action that is going on at this moment.</li>
	<li>Describe an action that is going on during a (current) period of time, like a trend or ongoing project (<strong><em>I'm</em></strong><em> still <strong>working</strong> on this website of mine</em>)</li>
	<li>Describe an action or event in the future which is already planned and prepared (<strong><em>I'm meeting</em></strong><em> with my girlfriend tomorrow</em>)</li>
	<li>Describe a temporary event or situation---something special that is currently going on (<em>It's raining now, but the sun should reveal herself any time</em>)</li>
	<li>Describe an ongoing series of repeating actions---with <em>always, forever </em>or<em> constantly</em> in front (<em>You two are always arguing!</em>)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Continuous Past</h5>

<p>The continuous past is constructed by using a <strong>past</strong> form of <strong>to be + continuous </strong>form.</p>

> <em>We were walking. They were talking. I was waiting. You were learning.</em>

<p>It's used to describe actions before now, which began in the past and are still going on or interrupted/unfinished. Usually this is used to describe what was happening while some main event occurred:</p>

> <em>The birds <strong>were singing</strong> and the trees <strong>were swinging</strong> as the lion woke up.</em>

<p>It's also used, in combination with <em>to wonder</em>, to make a very polite request:</p>

> <em>I <strong>was wondering</strong> if you would like to go to the ball with me.</em>

<h5>Continuous Future</h5>

<p>The continuous future is constructed by using '<strong>will be' + continuous </strong>form.</p>

> <em>She will be sleeping over next Monday. They will be dancing at the party next week.</em>

<p>It's used to describe actions that will be in progress at some time in the future. This can be a completely new action (<em>I will be learning English tomorrow</em>) or one that has already been started but isn't finished yet (<em>I will still be learning English tomorrow</em>). The latter must always be combined with still.</p>

<p>Other uses are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Predicting or guessing future events (<em>I think we will be having a hard time tomorrow</em>)</li>
	<li>Asking politely for information about the future (<em>Will you be working on the assignment tomorrow?</em>)</li>
	<li>Referring to events we expect to happen ( = be ongoing) in the future. (<em>Tomorrow it will be raining cats and dogs</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>For negative sentences, you can use <strong>won't be + continuous</strong> form.</p>

  title: "[English] Verbs III"
  post: "<p>This is where the real fun begins. Up until now we've only seen the basic building blocks of English (well, of any language really). You could write articles and novels with only those tenses, but that would quickly become a very monotone story. That's where the perfect tense and some more fancy stuff kicks in.</p> 

<h2>Perfect Tenses</h2>

<p>Perfect tenses is where the different time spans and simple/continuous begin to overlap and mix. There are therefore <strong><em>6</em></strong> variations on it, all equally important. So let's start.</p>

<h5>Simple Present Perfect</h5>

<p>The simple present perfect is constructed by using a regular form of <strong>to have + past</strong> <strong>participle</strong>.</p>

> <em>I have lived here all my life. They have been to the zoo twice this week. We have been to the zoo several times. She has just finished reading the book. He has read the Hobbit thrice. </em>

<p>It's used for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An action/situation that started in the past and still continues in the present.</li>
	<li>An action performed during a period that has not yet finished.</li>
	<li>A repeated action in an unspecified period between the past and the present.</li>
	<li>An action that was completed in very recent past, expressed with <strong>just</strong>.</li>
	<li>An action when the time is not important, but the result.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Continuous Present Perfect</h5>

<p>The continuous present perfect is constructed by using a <em>regular form</em> of <strong>to have + 'been' + continuous</strong> form.</p>

> <em>I have been cycling to school every day for years. They have been kissing for an hour now.</em>

<p>It's used for actions that started an unspecified time <em>before now</em> and are still going on in the present.</p>

> <em>She has been waiting for him all day </em>(&hellip;when exactly did she start waiting? We don't know)

<p>It can also be used for actions that have just finished, and we are interested in the results.</p>

> <em>It's been raining since last night </em>(...which means the streets are still wet)

<h5>Simple Past Perfect</h5>

<p>The simple past perfect is constructed by using a <em>past form</em> of <strong>to have + past participle.</strong></p>

> <em>Mark <strong>had</strong> already <strong>left</strong> when I arrived. She <strong>had just saved</strong> the document when the computer crashed.</em>

<p>If the present perfect is about actions starting before now and going on until the present, the past goes back even further---it's about actions starting <em>earlier than before now</em>. Because the whole sentence is in the past, the simple past perfect is mostly about making clear that one event happened before another (in the past).</p>

<h5>Continuous Past Perfect</h5>

<p>The continuous past perfect is constructed by using a past form of <strong>to have + 'been' + continuous </strong>form.</p>

> <em>We <strong>had been trying</strong> to contact him, but we were unable to reach him.</em>

<p>Again, it describes a process that was happening in a time <em>earlier than before now</em>. The example sentence could be rewritten to:</p>

> <em>We were unable to reach him </em>(they concluded they failed to reach him in a time before now)<em>, after we <strong>had been trying </strong>to contact him </em>(and even earlier, they already tried contacting him)

<p>This tense can also be used in <em>reported speech</em>. Basically, if someone says something about the past, and you want to say something about that quote, you use it.</p>

> <em>"I have been working in my office all day," Mark told the police</em>.

> <em>Mark told the police that he <strong>had been working</strong> in his office all day</em>.

<h5>Simple Future Perfect</h5>

<p>The simple future perfect is constructed by using <strong>'will have' + past participle</strong>.</p>

> <em>Soon, they will have arrived at the building. By the time you read this, I will have left this world.</em>

<p>They refer to a point in the future where an action is completed. We are basically placing ourselves in the future, and we see that a certain action will then be done or finished.</p>

<h5>Continuous Future Perfect</h5>

<p>The continuous future perfect is constructed by using <strong>'will have been' + continuous </strong>form.</p>

> <em>By 2016, I <strong>will have been living</strong> in Manchester for five years. </em>

<p>Because this is the continuous tense, we are again referring to an action to is still going on at a certain point in future time.</p>

> <em>Next week </em>(some point in the future)<em>, I will have been living with Sarah for two years </em>(you've completed two years of living with Sarah, but you haven't stopped living with her).

<h2>Passive Voice</h2>

<p>The passive voice is used when we want to place emphasis on the object, the 'victim' of the action, or we're just not interested in the subject. Usually though, using <em>active</em> language (which is everything we've discussed until now) is better, shorter and clearer---so try to use that whenever you can. Nevertheless, it's still important to know the passive voice, especially because it looks like a simple or continuous present tense, but means something entirely different.</p>

> (<em>active</em>) Alan Parsons wrote "Old &amp; Wise" => "Old &amp; Wise" was written by Alan Parsons (<em>passive</em>)

<p>The passive voice is constructed by a conjugated form of <strong>to be</strong> + <strong>past participle</strong>. It's a combination between the simple and continuous tenses, and the past participle from the perfect tense.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Notice that in all sentences we don't know who is, was or will be cleaning the car, we only know that the car is being cleaned.</p>

<p>The most prominent use of passive voice is with the fact that <em>being born</em> is something passive.</p>

> <em>I was born in 1997. Where were you born?</em>

<p>The so-called <em>infinitive passive voice</em> is used after modal verbs or other verbs requiring an <em>infinitive</em>, and is constructed by using <strong>'(to) be'</strong> <strong>+ past participle</strong>.</p>

> <em>You <strong>have to be tested</strong> on your writing skills. He <strong>wants to be invited</strong> to the party. She may <strong>be disappointed </strong>in you.</em>

<p>The <em>gerund passive voice</em> is used after verbs that require <em>gerunds</em> behind it on all other occasions, and is constructed by using <strong>'being' + past participle.</strong></p>

> <em>I hate interviewing => I hate <strong>being interviewed</strong></em>

> <em>My dogs like cuddling => My dogs like <strong>being cuddled</strong></em>

<p>Those <strong>infinitives</strong> and <strong>gerunds </strong>(and conditionals) are all discussed thoroughly in the next chapter!</p>

  title: "[English] Verbs IV"
  post: "<p>This last chapter on verbs will discuss the more fancy, complex or detailed types of sentences you'll run into. Some of them occur sparingly or almost solely in written English, but it's still important to see all that is possible.</p> 

<h2>Conditional tenses</h2>

<p>Until now we've only seen sentences that describe something that did or did not happen. Conditional tenses are used when there's a possibility of some event happening in the past, present or future, but only under a certain condition. Every one of these conditionals can be put in a different order without changing meaning, although that may require adding some extra determiners.</p>

<h5>Future Conditional</h5>

<p>The future conditional uses the construction:</p>

> <strong><em>If</em></strong><em> X happens, Y <strong>will </strong>happen.</em>

> <em>If he is late again, I will be very angry.</em>

<p>The first part uses the simple present, while the second part uses the simple future.</p>

<h5>Present (Zero) Conditional</h5>

<p>The present conditional uses the construction:</p>

<p>               <strong><em>If</em></strong><em> X happens, Y happens.</em></p>

<p><em>               If water <strong>cools down</strong>, it <strong>freezes</strong>.</em></p>

<p>Both parts use the simple present. It's often called a zero conditional, because it doesn't really involve a condition: Y is the natural consequence of X and will always follow immediately.</p>

<h5>Past Conditional</h5>

<p>The past conditional uses the construction:</p>

> <strong><em>If</em></strong><em> X happened, Y would be happening.</em>

> <em>If he was a better soccer player, he would be scoring goals now.</em>

<p>Both parts of the conditional are false: he isn't scoring goals now, which means he's not as good of a soccer player. But on the condition that he was a better player, he would be scoring now.</p>

<h5>Past Perfect Conditional</h5>

<p>The past perfect conditional uses the construction:</p>

<p>               <strong><em>If</em></strong><em> X had happened, Y would have happened</em></p>

<p><em>               If Mark had had more time, he would have visited his grandparents.</em></p>

<p>Again, both parts are false and the chance to change it lies in the past, but this time we're in that <em>earlier than before now</em> state. If Mark had had more time in the past, he would by now already have completed his quest of visiting his grandparents.</p>

<h5>Mixed Conditional</h5>

<p>Mixed conditionals mix several of the previously discussed types. There's basically two types:</p>

<p><strong>Present result of past condition:</strong> If X had happened (in the past), Y would happen (now).</p>

> <em>If I had studied, I would have my high school diploma.</em>

<p><strong>Past result of present (or continuing) condition:</strong> If X happened (just now), Y would have happened (in the past).</p>

> <em>If I wasn't afraid of failure, I would have sang the song in front of a large crowd.</em>

<h2>Gerund &amp; Present Participle</h2>

<p>The Gerund and Present Participle in theory mean nothing else than the <em>continuous form</em> of a verb we've been using all along. But, they portray two different functions.</p>

<h5>Gerund</h5>

<p>It always has the <em>function</em> of a noun, even though it looks like a verb.</p>

<p>It can stand on its own as the subject of a sentence: <strong><em>Hunting</em></strong><em> is bad for the environment</em>. In all other cases, it functions as part of a noun and needs other words around it.</p>

<p>It <strong>must</strong> be used after:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A preposition: <em>We arrived <strong>after</strong> <strong>driving</strong> for two hours</em></li>
	<li>A phrasal verb (verb made from more than one word): <em>He has been trying to <strong>give up smoking</strong>.</em></li>
	<li>The expressions <em>can't help, can't stand, to be worth </em>and <em>it's no use</em>: <em>It's no use trying to escape.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>A last possible use is as a complement of the verb <strong>to be</strong>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:20.4pt"><em>His life goal is to find all Pok&eacute;mon => His life goal <strong>is finding </strong>all Pok&eacute;mon</em></p>

<h5>Present Participle</h5>

<p>In contrast to the gerund, the present participle actually has the expected function of a verb. It is used in the continuous tenses, but has many other uses.</p>

<ul>
	<li>After verbs of movement and position, for example: <em>to go, to come, to lay, to sit.</em>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>They went hiking. She lay looking at the stars. I came running towards him. We sat staring out of the window.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>After verbs of perception, for example: <em>to hear, to see, to smell, to watch, to feel.</em>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>I felt the wind blowing in my face. I heard someone singing down the street.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>With the verbs <em>spend</em> and <em>waste</em>: the construction is <strong>verb + time/money expression + present participle</strong>.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>The doctor spends five hours a day sleeping. I wasted a hundred dollars trying to get there.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>With the verbs <em>catch</em> and <em>find</em>: the construction is <strong>verb + object + present participle</strong>.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>I caught him stealing my wallet. They found two old coins lying in the sand.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Describing two actions at the same time: the construction is usually <strong>present participle + actual action</strong>.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Singing to herself, she cycled to school. 'Hands behind your head,' he said, pulling his gun.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Infinitives</h2>

<p>Infinitives have many different uses and specific constructions they appear in. To keep things organized, I will introduce two different types of infinitives:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The regular infinitive: <strong>to + base verb</strong> (<em>to remember</em>)</li>
	<li>The zero infinitive: <strong>base verb </strong>(<em>remember</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>To negate the infinitive you simply put the word <strong>not</strong> in front, as this can always be done in this case.</p>

<h5>Regular Infinitive</h5>

<p>It can be used:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To indicate the purpose or intention of an action. In that case, the word <em>to</em> could be replaced with <em>in order to</em> or <em>so as to</em>.

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>She came to school <strong>to receive</strong> her award.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>As the subject of a sentence. This makes sentences needlessly complicated, so is most often seen in written works of art.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><strong><em>To find </em></strong><em>true love is the purpose of life! <strong>To be</strong> or not to be.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>To indicate what something can or will be used for.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>They will need some space <strong>to work</strong> in. Would you like a slice of cake <strong>to eat</strong>?</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>After adjectives. The construction is:
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Subject + to be + adjective ( + for/of someone) + regular infinitive ( + rest of sentence).</li>
		<li><em>He is interesting for you <strong>to talk</strong> to. She is a nice girl <strong>to flirt</strong> with.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>To make a comment or judgment. The construction is:
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Subject + to be + noun phrase + regular infinitive.</li>
		<li><em>They are a dangerous group <strong>to run into</strong> late at night. Jim is the worst person<strong> to ask</strong> for these kind of matters.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>With adverbs<em> too </em>and <em>enough</em>.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>She is too beautiful <strong>to flirt</strong> with. There is enough food <strong>to feed</strong> everyone here.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>With question words. The verbs <em>ask, decide, explain, forget, know, show, tell </em>and <em> understand</em> can be followed by a question word + regular infinitive.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Do you know how <strong>to draw</strong> a cat? Has he explained when it's best <strong>to mow</strong> the lawn? No, but I've been show how <strong>to draw</strong> a dog instead.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h5>Zero Infinitive</h5>

<p>Luckily, the zero infinitive has far less uses. These are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>After auxiliaries.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>He can't <strong>explain</strong> that to you now. Would she <strong>tell</strong> you if she knew?</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>After verbs of perception. The construction is:
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Verb + object + zero infinitive</li>
		<li><em>They heard her scream. We watched him try to get on his bike.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>After the verbs <em>make</em> and <em>let</em>.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Let's <strong>go</strong>! You made him <strong>do</strong> that.'</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>After the expression <em>had better</em>.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>She had better <strong>go</strong> to bed now. You'd better <strong>give</strong> me some more time!</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>In combination with <em>why</em>, making a suggestion.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Why <strong>wait</strong> until he returns? Why not <strong>sleep</strong> at Jim's place?</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

  title: "[English] Adjectives"
  post: "<p>Adjectives help nouns. They always apply to one or several noun(s), and attempt to enrich their target by adding more information or detailing. You could say <em>Two girls are walking down the street. One girl finds a wallet.</em> But then we'd all be wondering: which one of them? Adding an adjective clears things up: <em>A short and tall girl are walking down the street together. The tall one finds a wallet</em>. As you can see, adjectives add more detail and information, but also increase sentence length and complexity. You should therefore not stuff every sentence with adjectives---only use them when they are actually useful or necessary. In some cases, you can find a single <em>noun</em> to replace <em>adjective + noun</em>.</p> 

> <strong><em>Adjectives </em></strong><em>modify or describe nouns</em>

> <strong><em>Examples: </em></strong><em>red, boring, beautiful, tall, short, nice, friendly, inviting, green</em>

<h2>Placement of Adjectives</h2>

<p>There are two ways to place adjectives:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Immediately in front of the noun: </strong><em>Yesterday, I've placed a <strong>small</strong> table in my <strong>big</strong> house.</em></li>
	<li><strong>After being or sensing verbs: </strong><em>My house is <strong>big</strong>. The table seems <strong>small</strong>.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Adjectives don't change their form based on the gender or number (singular/plural) of the noun they belong to---they always stay the same.</p>

<p>NOTE: To intensify adjectives, you can use the word <strong>very</strong> or <strong>really</strong> in front of them. Those are actually adverbs, and will be discussed in the next chapter. But, sometimes an intensified version of the noun is already available in the dictionary, and it is advised to use that.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: The adjectives <em>involved, present </em>and<em> concerned</em> can appear behind the noun, but that changes their meaning.</p>

<h2>Comparing with Adjectives</h2>

<p>There are a few different structures to use when comparing equal and unequal nouns:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Equal; <strong>as + adjective + as</strong>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Jack is as tall as Jim</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Unequal; <strong>not as + adjective + as</strong>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Jack is not as tall as Jim</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Unequal; <strong>less + adjective + than</strong>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Jack is less tall than Jim</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Unequal; <strong>comparative adjective + than</strong>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Jack is taller than Jim</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>One clear winner of the comparison; <strong>the + superlative adjective</strong>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Jack is the tallest of the two.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>How to form the comparative and superlative adjective will be discussed next section.</p>

<h2>Comparative &amp; Superlative</h2>

<p>It depends on the amount of syllables in a word how the comparative and superlative are formed.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>One Syllable.</strong> Add <strong>---er</strong> for comparative and <strong>---est</strong> for superlative. If the adjective ends with the pattern <em>single vowel + consonant</em>, you need to double the consonant.

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Tall => Tall<strong>er</strong> => Tall<strong>est</strong></em></li>
		<li><em>Sad => Sad<strong>d</strong>er => Sad<strong>d</strong>est</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Two Syllables. </strong>Not all of these can be formed in the way described above, and are formed by using <strong>more + adjective</strong> for comparative and <strong>most + adjective</strong> for superlative. If you are not sure, you can always play safe and use that system. Adjectives ending in <strong>---y</strong> need to replace it with an <strong>---i</strong>.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Happy => Happier => Happiest</em></li>
		<li><em>Tilted => More tilted => Most titled</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Three or More Syllables.</strong> These adjectives always follow the <em>most </em>and <em>more</em> pattern.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Important => More important => Most important</em></li>
		<li><em>Beautiful => More beautiful => Most beautiful</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important comparative adjectives are irregular, and you will have to just memorize the following table.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Normal Adjective</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Comparative</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Superlative</p>

			<td>
			<p>furthest / farthest</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p> </p>

<h2>Quantities</h2>

<p>Right at the start of this course, we talked about <em>countable</em> and <em>uncountable nouns</em>. If you want to compare <em>quantities</em>, there are different words you should use.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p> </p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>A = B</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>A = B</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>A > B</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>A < B</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><em>Countable</em></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>many</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>few</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>more</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>fewer</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><em>Uncountable</em></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>much</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>little</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>more</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>less</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p> </p>

<p><em>What's the difference between the first two columns? </em>The first describes two equal nouns that are in numerous quantities. The second describes two equal nouns that are scarce.</p>

> <em>It seems as if there are <strong>as many children</strong> on the playground <strong>as</strong> there are ants in the world. </em>(there were a lot of children there)

> <em>We had <strong>little money</strong> </em>(they didn't have a lot of money).

> <em>He had even <strong>less patience</strong> than Jim.</em>

> <em>They had <strong>fewer points</strong> than the other team.</em>

<h2>Multiple Adjectives</h2>

<p>There is no fixed order you must follow when using multiple adjectives in a row, but there is a sort of generally accepted order you should use most of the time, which is:</p>

<p>Quantity => Value/Opinion => Size => Temperature => Age => Shape => Colour => Origin => Material</p>

<p><strong><em>Examples: </em></strong><em>The two beautiful birds. The large, cold ice cream. The two ten year olds. The rectangular, green box. The awesome metal car.</em></p>

  title: "[English] Adverbs"
  post: "<p>Adverbs are the wildcard of any language. They can be formed out of anything, and applied to nearly everything. The subject and object in a sentence (nouns + adjectives) answers the question <strong><em>Who?</em></strong> The verb answers the question <strong><em>What?</em></strong> Relative clauses usually answer the question <strong><em>Why?</em></strong></p>

<p>Adverbs try to answer the remaining questions: <em>When? Where? </em>and<em> How?</em></p>

> <strong><em>Adverbs</em></strong><em> modify a verb, adjective or other adverb.</em>

> <strong><em>Examples:</em></strong><em> The lived <strong>happily</strong> ever after. He <strong>angrily</strong> threw the baseball. The test went <strong>very well</strong>.</em>

<p>You can find adverbs by rephrasing a sentence in interrogative form:</p>

> <em>Mark just loudly sang the beautifully composed song there.</em>

> <em>How did Mark sing? Loudly</em>

> <em>How was the song composed? Beautifully </em>

> <em>When did Mark sing? Just </em>(not so long ago)

> <em>Where did Mark sing? There</em>

<p>As you can see, adverbs are everywhere, but rarely stand on their own in a sentence. If they modify a verb, they are usually placed after it. If the modify an adjective, they are placed in front of it.</p>

<h2>Forming Adverbs</h2>

<p>In most cases, they are formed by adding <strong>---ly</strong> behind their adjective.</p>

> <em>Quick => Quick<strong>ly</strong>.</em>

<p>Again, if the adjective ends in an <strong>---y</strong>, replace it with an <strong>---i</strong>.</p>

> <em>Easy => Eas<strong>ily</strong>.</em>

<p>If the adjective ends in <strong>---able,---ible or---le</strong>, replace the <strong>---e</strong> with an <strong>---i</strong>.</p>

> <em>Terrible => Terr<strong>ibly</strong></em><strong>.</strong>

<p>If the adjective ends in <strong>---ic</strong>, add <strong>---ally</strong> at the end.</p>

> <em>Basic => Basic<strong>ally</strong>.</em>

> <em>One exception: public => publicly.</em>

<p>Some common adjectives have the same form as adverbs, which are:</p>

> <em>Early, fast, hard, high, late, near, straight </em>and <em>wrong</em>

> <em>She always drives very <strong>fast</strong>.</em>

<p>And one very important thing to remember, is that the adverb of <em>good</em> is <strong>well</strong>.</p>

> <em>She is a good soccer player => She plays <strong>well</strong>.</em>

<h2>Comparative and Superlative Adverb</h2>

<p>Because adverbs end in <strong>---ly</strong>, you could form the comparative and superlative with <strong>---ier</strong> and <strong>---iest</strong>. But, the most common (and better) approach is to just place <strong>more </strong>and <strong>most</strong> in front.</p>

> <em>Slowly => More slowly => Most slowly</em>

<p>Very short adverbs that do not end in---ly (especially the ones that didn't change), are formed in the usual way:</p>

> <em>Fast => Faster => Fastest</em>

<h2>Relative Adverbs</h2>

<p>You can always use the structure <strong>(in/at/on/for) + which</strong> to connect a relative clause to the sentence.</p>

> <em>There was a rain storm going on the week <strong>in which</strong> she was born</em>

<p>But, you can make the sentence shorter and clearer by using <em>relative adverbs</em> (<strong>where, when</strong> or <strong>why</strong>) instead:</p>

> <em>There was a rain storm going on the week <strong>when</strong> she was born</em>

<h2>Interrogative Adverbs</h2>

<p>We've been talking about <em>who, what, where, when, why </em>and<em> how</em> the whole time, and now we can give them a name: <em>interrogative adverbs</em>.</p>

<p>You can place them at the beginning of a sentence, and if you don't forget to switch around the subject and verb, you have a question:</p>

> <em>How often do you shave?</em>

> <em>Where did he suddenly come from?</em>

> <em>What time is it?</em>

<p>The word <em>how</em> has only four specific uses:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When it means <em>in what way.</em>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>How do you repair a bike?</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>To ask about the degree of an attribute (/adjective)
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>How old do you think he is?</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>In combination with other adverbs, to ask about frequency or degree of an action
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>How fast did he run!?</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Used with much and many to ask about quantity.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>How much time did you put into this assignment?</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Viewpoint and Commenting Adverbs</h2>

<p>A very common practice in English is to put some of your own values into a sentence with an adverb. You can---subtly or not---express your viewpoint, opinion or comments on a topic. Such a commenting adverb can be placed in front of the sentence or at the end, separated by a comma. It can also be placed in front of the main verb, but that is somewhat unusual.</p>

> <strong><em>Clearly</em></strong><em>, she doesn't know what she's talking about. </em>(the writer's opinion is that <em>she</em> doesn't know what she's doing, and doesn't believe in her)

> <em>He <strong>undoubtedly</strong> has prepared accordingly. </em>(the writer isn't sure, but his opinion is that <em>he</em> is a good fellow that always prepares himself well)

> <em>They are the ones to blame, <strong>obviously</strong>. </em>(the writer is really sure about who is to blame, and therefore states that it's obvious, even though it might not be obvious at all)

<h2>List of Common Adverbs</h2>

<h5>Adverbs of Place</h5>

<p>The most common ones are <strong>here</strong> (something close by) and <strong>there </strong>(something far away). Those are usually placed at the end of the sentence or after prepositions, but can be put at the front in sentence with exclamations or emphasis needed. In the <em>pronouns</em> chapter we also already discussed the important <strong>everywhere, anywhere, somewhere</strong> and <strong>nowhere</strong>.</p>

<p>But, there's also a list of words that function as an adverb as well as preposition (it never works the other way around: prepositions are not adverbs).</p>

<table>

		<tr>

<h5>Adverbs of Time</h5>

<p>There are three types of adverbs of time: <em>how long, how often</em> and <em>when (exactly)</em>. If you use multiple, they should always be in that order. Time follows place in a sentence (unless you intend to emphasize one of them).</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong> <em>yesterday, tomorrow, today, later, now, last year, next year, &hellip;</em></p>

<p><strong>How often: </strong><em>all day, for weeks, for years, since Tuesday, &hellip;</em></p>

<p><strong>How long: </strong><em>often, never, always, seldom, rarely, frequently, regularly, usually, once a week, monthly, &hellip;</em></p>

<p>The word <strong>yet</strong> is used in questions and negative sentences if something hasn't happened or may not have happened, but is expected to happen.</p>

> <em>Have you finished working on that project <strong>yet</strong>?</em>

<p>The word <strong>still</strong> expresses continuity, mostly used in positive sentences. It is placed before the main verb, and after it if it is an <em>auxiliary verb</em>.</p>

> <em>He is still in love with you.</em>

<h5>Adverbs of Manner</h5>

<p>If a verb has an object (direct or indirect), the adverb needs to be placed in front of it or at the end of the clause. If not, it's best to put the adverb right behind.</p>

<p><em>Why?</em> Because sometimes a sentence contains multiple verbs, and placing the adverb at the end of a sentence/away from its corresponding verb applies it to the whole clause, which you may not always want.</p>

<p>Adverbs of manner tell how something happened, for example: <em>well, quickly, patiently, greedily, softly, beautifully, angrily, roughly, &hellip;</em></p>

<p>The adverbs of manner <em>well, badly, hard </em>and<em> fast</em> almost always come immediately after its verb.</p>

<h5>Adverbs of Degree</h5>

<p>Tell us about the intensity or degree of an action, usually placed directly before whatever they are modifying.</p>

<p>The adverb <strong>enough</strong> comes <em>after</em> what it modifies, and means something like "to the necessary degree". This can also express a quantity; <em>as much/many as necessary</em>. Often followed by <em>for someone</em>, <em>for something </em>or <em>"to"+infinitive</em>.</p>

> <em>He didn't do enough to pass the exam. But it was enough for me. Now I have enough points to get my diploma.</em>

<p>The adverb <strong>too</strong> has the same properties, and can have two meanings:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>"Also"</em>: in this case, it is placed at the end of the sentence

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>I like swimming <strong>too</strong>!</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>"<em>excessively"</em>: in this case, it comes before what it modifies
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Am I <strong>too</strong> fat?</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The adverb <strong>very</strong> makes an adverb or adjective stronger. In contrast to <em>too</em>, it simply states a fact, while <em>too</em> says there is a problem (things have gone too far). <strong>Not very</strong> can be used as a kind way to create a negative sentence.</p>

> <em>It was very bad => It wasn't very good</em>

<h5>Adverbs of Certainty</h5>

<p>Express how certain we feel about an event or action. Always go before the main verb, unless that verb is some form of <strong>to be</strong>. These are: <em>certainly, definitely, probably, undoubtedly, surely</em></p>

> <em>She probably has some tricks up her sleeve. She is definitely a trickster.</em>

  title: "[English] Determiners"
  post: "<p>All that's left to learn now, is a few simple but crucial words. I could have spread them all throughout the course, but I think that would have made it too messy and confusing, so that's why I'm presenting it as one group here.</p> 

> <strong><em>Determiners</em></strong><em> are placed in front of a noun to make clear what it refers to</em>

> <strong><em>Examples:</em></strong><em> <strong>my</strong> hat, <strong>these</strong> people, <strong>a few</strong> birds, <strong>ten</strong> children, <strong>other</strong> options</em>

<p>Determiners have 9 subcategories. But luckily, 4 of them have already been discussed:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Definite article:</strong> <em>the</em></li>
	<li><strong>Indefinite article:</strong> <em>a, an</em></li>
	<li><strong>Possessive determiners:</strong> <em>my, your, his, her, its, our, their</em></li>
	<li><strong>Quantifiers: </strong><em>a few, a little, much, many, most, some, any, enough, a lot of</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The others each have their own section with some explanation</p>

<h2>Demonstratives</h2>

<p>Demonstratives are used to show how nearby or close a noun we're referring to is. They are placed before the noun, or on their own if the noun itself is understood from the context.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p> </p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Close by ("here")</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Far away ("there")</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><em>Singular &amp; Uncountable</em></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>This</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>That</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><em>Plural</em></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>These</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Those</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p> </p>

<p>They can be used to show <em>placement</em> or <em>position</em> of things, but also as a way of referring back to things mentioned earlier (in the sentence or paragraph). In those cases you also follow the <em>close by/far away</em> rules.</p>

> <em>I like birds very much. It's this obsession that keeps me awake at night. </em>(the obsession is of the speaker himself, so very close to him.)

> <em>He is more into lions. That's no problem, they are cool too. </em>(his obsession is away from the speaker.)

<p>Use <em>this</em> if you could hold something up in your hand, and <em>that</em> if you would point to it. With abstract things, you can do neither, and it's up to you to find out what sounds best.</p>

<p>Try to (mentally) substitute this/that with <em>this here</em> or <em>that here</em>, and you will often find what is the obvious choice.</p>

<h2>Numbers</h2>

<p>Numbers are placed in front of the noun, and the noun of course has to be put into plural form if the number is higher than one. The integers 0-10 are:</p>

> <em>Zero, One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten</em>

<p>The <em>ranking numbers</em> (that show the rank of a noun in a certain order) are formed <strong>number + th</strong>. The first three ranking numbers are irregular, and are <strong>first, second </strong>and <strong>third</strong>.</p>

> <em>Seven => Seventh. Ten => Tenth. Twenty => Twentieth</em>

<p>When talking about numbers that are not integers but fractions we use the form <strong>numerator</strong> <strong>+ ranking form denominator. </strong>Ranking numbers ending in <strong>---th</strong> get an extra <strong>---s</strong>.</p>

> <em>1/3 => One Third. 4/5 => Four Fifths</em>

<p>Going one step further, we get to the decimal numbers, which use the construction <strong>"point" + every number behind the dot written individually</strong>.</p>

> <em>0.6632 => point six six three two</em>

<p>And lastly, there are four ways to say <strong>0</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Zero:</strong> if it's within a number</li>
	<li><strong>O:</strong> when reading years, addresses, times and temperatures</li>
	<li><strong>Nil:</strong> when reporting sports scores</li>
	<li><strong>Nought:</strong> used sparingly, for example when the zero is a subscript in a mathematical equation. Not used in the USA.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Distributives</h2>

<p>Distributives, as the name suggests, distribute a noun among a group. There are four different types:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Each</strong> and <strong>every</strong>: to talk about members of a group as individuals

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Each of them wanted a piece of cake.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>All:</strong> to talk about the group as a whole
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>All members thought a reorganization of the company was necessary.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Half: </strong>to talk about a divided group
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Half of the citizens were against the proposal</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Both, either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>: to talk about pairs of people/things
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>Both parties agreed on the contract. Neither one wanted to hurt the other's feelings.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Difference Words</h2>

<p>Difference words refer to something different, remaining or additional. There's only two of them:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Other:</strong> for plural countable and uncountable nouns, and any noun that takes <em>the</em>.

<h2>Pre-Determiners</h2>

<p>Pre-determiners are placed before an <strong>indefinite article </strong>(a/an) <strong>+ adjective + noun</strong> to express an opinion about the noun they modify. These are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Such</strong> and <strong>what</strong>: to express surprise or other emotions.

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>What a lovely dress! We've had such a good time in the cinema.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Rather </strong>and <strong>quite:</strong> to refer to the degree the adjective modifies the noun. It depends on the adjective whether they bring positive or negative emotions.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><em>That's quite a lovely dress. I've had a rather good time in the cinema.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

  title: "Words & Phrases to Avoid"
  post: "<p>Most writers are lazy. They use vague language to get the job done, where a definite statement would make the writing shorter and clearer. This article isn't so much about correcting bad English as improving your style. Many expressions mentioned here are grammatically correct, and even very popular, but should be restricted to colloquialisms. The book <em>Elements of Style</em>---which I highly recommend---has been the inspiration for this article.</p> 

<h2>An Alphabetic List</h2>

<p><strong>Absolutely</strong></p>

<p>Often redundant when used to emphasize adjectives. Either someone is honest, or he isn't. Absolutely honest doesn't make him more honest.</p>

<p><strong>All right</strong></p>

<p>Alright has become more popular, but two separate words is still the correct form. Used in familiar speech in the sense of <em>"Agreed" </em>or <em>"Go ahead"</em>. Avoid using it for anything else.</p>

<p><strong>Always</strong></p>

<p>Unless you're giving written commands or instruction, find another word. Always is rarely true, and opens the door to criticism regarding inaccuracies.</p>

<p><strong>Amazing</strong></p>

<p>Overused. Omit it, or at least find a more fitting synonym. If everything is amazing, nothing is.</p>

<p><strong>As good or better</strong></p>

<p>Rearrange the sentence so that "<em>or better</em>" (or "<em>if not better</em>") is at the end</p>

> <em>This is as good or better than that => This is as good as that, or better</em>

<p><strong>As to whether</strong></p>

<p>Just <em>whether</em> is sufficient.</p>

<p><strong>Bid</strong></p>

<p>Takes the infinitive without <em>to</em>. The past tense is <em>bade</em>.</p>

> <em>I bade him to do it => I bade him do it</em>.

<p><strong>Case</strong></p>

<p>When used in the senses <em>instance of a thing's occurring</em> or <em>usual state of affairs</em>, it's usually unnecessary.</p>

> <em>In many cases, the houses had been destroyed => Many houses had been destroyed.</em>

<p><strong>Certainly</strong></p>

<p>Used too often to intensify any and every statement. Don't.</p>

<p><strong>Character</strong></p>

<p>Often redundant and used out of habit only.</p>

> <em>Acts of a hostile character => Hostile acts</em>

<p><strong>Claim</strong></p>

<p>With object, means <em>lay claim to</em>. Not to be used as a substitute for <em>declare, maintain</em> or <em>charge</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Compare</strong></p>

<p>The preposition that accompanies it makes the difference.</p>

> To <em>compare to</em> is to point out or imply resemblances between objects regarded as different

> To <em>compare with</em> is to point out differences between objects regarded as similar

<p><strong>Clever</strong></p>

<p>Greatly overused. Best restricted to ingenuity displayed in small matters.</p>

<p><strong>Consider</strong></p>

<p>When followed by <em>"as"</em> means <em>"believe to be"</em>. Otherwise means <em>"examined" </em>or <em>"discussed".</em></p>

<p><strong>Dependable</strong></p>

<p>A needless substitute for <em>reliable</em> or <em>trustworthy</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Due to</strong></p>

<p>Correctly used when related to a particular noun as predicate or modifier.</p>

> <em>Losses due to bad policy</em>

<p>Incorrectly used for <em>through, because of</em> or <em>owing to</em> in adverbial phrases:</p>

> <em>She lost the game, due to carelessness</em>

<p><strong>Effect</strong></p>

<p>As noun, means <em>result.</em> As verb, means to <em>bring about </em>or<em> accomplish. </em>Should not be confused with <em>affect</em>, which means <em>"to influence"</em>.</p>

<p>Too often used as a vague substitute in writing about any sort of art (<em>"the painter used very delicate effects"</em>), which is bad.</p>

<p><strong>Etc.</strong></p>

<p>Equivalent to <em>and the rest</em> or <em>and so forth</em>. Should therefore not be used of persons, or if the reader could be left in doubt as to any important particulars. Best used to shorten a list which has already been given in full, or to replace unimportant words at the end of a quotation.</p>

<p>Ending lists starting with expressions like <em>such as</em> or <em>for example</em> with "<em>etc.</em>" is incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>Fact</strong></p>

<p>Use this only of actual facts, matters capable of direct verification, and never for matters of judgment, however incontestable they may be.</p>

<p><strong>Factor</strong></p>

<p>Overused. Can often be replaced by something more direct or definite.</p>

> <em>Superior preparation was the biggest factor in his winning => He won by being prepared better</em>

<p><strong>Feature</strong></p>

<p>Like factor, it usually adds nothing to a sentence.</p>

<p>To be avoided in the advertising sense of <em>offer as a special attraction</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Fix</strong></p>

<p>Colloquial (in American English) for <em>arrange, prepare</em> or <em>mend</em>. Restrict it to its literary senses; <em>fasten, make firm</em> or <em>immovable</em>, etc.</p>

<p><strong>He is a man who</strong></p>

<p>A common type of redundant expression, with some variations;</p>

> <em>England is a country which I like => I like England.</em>

> <em>He is a man who likes to play games => He likes to play games</em>

<p><strong>Honestly</strong></p>

<p>Often used to add emphasis, but should be avoided, for it implies that the rest of your statements wasn't honest.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong></p>

<p>Comes first in the sentence when it means "<em>in whatever way</em>" or "<em>to whatever extent</em>".</p>

> <em>However hard you try, it won't happen.</em>

<p>Not to come first when it means "<em>nevertheless</em>".</p>

> <em>I feel sorry for him. It is, however, not my problem.</em>

<p><strong>Irregardless</strong></p>

<p>It's not a word. Regard<em>less</em> already means <em>without</em> regard.</p>

<p><strong>Just</strong></p>

<p>Unless you're using it with the meaning of <em>equitable, fair, even-handed</em> or <em>impartial</em>, don't use it at all. Often has no meaning and makes your sentences weaker.</p>

<p><strong>Kind of</strong></p>

<p>Don't use it as substitute for <em>rather</em> (before adjectives and verbs) or <em>something like</em> (before nouns). Restrict it to its literal sense;</p>

> <em>He plays guitar with a strange kind of passion.</em>

<p>The same is true for <em>sort of</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Less</strong></p>

<p>Don't misuse it for <em>fewer</em>. <em>Less</em> refers to quantity (or "size"), <em>fewer</em> to number.</p>

> <em>His troubles are less than mine </em>= he has smaller troubles

> <em>His troubles are fewer than mine </em>= he doesn't have as many troubles as I do

<p>An exception are round numbers, which are regarded as a collective noun.</p>

<p><strong>Line</strong></p>

<p>Can be used in the sense of <em>course of procedure, conduct</em> or <em>thought</em>, but has been overdone so much (especially with the phrase <em>along these lines</em>), that you better avoid it.</p>

<p><strong>Literally</strong></p>

<p>Too often incorrectly used in support of exaggeration or violent metaphor, or when the writer actually means <em>figuratively</em>.</p>

> <em>He was literally dead with fatigue => He was almost dead with fatigue</em>

<p><strong>Lose out</strong></p>

<p>Used to sound more emphatic than <em>lose</em>, but doesn't work. The same holds for <em>try out, win out, sign up </em>and <em>register up</em>.</p>

<p>A number of verbs form combinations with <em>out </em>and <em>up</em>, with different meanings---but lose out does not.</p>

<p><strong>Maybe</strong></p>

<p>Communicates uncertainty. Unless you are posing a question, be sure of what you write and create informed pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Nature</strong></p>

<p>Often redundant, just like <em>character</em>. Sentences can usually be shortened, or more specific statements need to follow to explain one another.</p>

> <em>Acts of a hostile nature => Hostile acts</em>

<p><strong>Near by</strong></p>

<p>Analogous with <em>close by</em> and <em>hard by</em>, but is usually written as one word; <em>nearby</em>. <em>Near (at hand)</em>, however, is as good, if not better.</p>

<p>Not to be used as an adjective; use <em>neighbouring </em>instead.</p>

<p><strong>Never</strong></p>

<p>See: <em>"always"</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Oftentimes</strong></p>

<p>Archaic, use <em>often</em>.</p>

<p><strong>One hundred and one</strong></p>

<p>Retain the <em>"and"</em> in this and similar expressions.</p>

<p><strong>One of the most</strong></p>

<p>Avoid beginning paragraphs with this kind of formula;</p>

> <em>The guitar is one of the most universally played instruments, &hellip;</em>

<p>It's not wrong, and even sounds good, but it's clich&eacute;, vague and meaningless.</p>

<p><strong>People</strong></p>

<p><em>The people</em> is a political term; they create political support or opposition. Don't confuse it with <em>the public</em>, from whom comes artistic appreciation or commercial support.</p>

<p>Don't use <em>people</em> with after number words when <em>persons</em> can be used.</p>

<p><strong>Phase</strong></p>

<p>Means<em> stage of transition or development</em>, not <em>aspect</em> or <em>topic</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Possess</strong></p>

<p>Don't use it as a mere substitute for the simpler verbs <em>have</em> or <em>own</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Really</strong></p>

<p>Just as "<em>very</em>", don't use it to modify an adjective, verb or adverb.</p>

<p><strong>Respectively</strong></p>

<p>May usually be omitted, often improving sentence clarity.</p>

> <em>The books are listed under the names of their respective authors</em>

> <em>The books are listed under the names of their authors</em>

<p>In some kinds of formal writing (such as geometrical proofs) it may be necessary, but it shouldn't appear in writing otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>So</strong></p>

<p>Avoid using it as an intensifier (<em>so good</em>).</p>

<p><strong>To state</strong></p>

<p>Don't use it as a mere substitute for <em>say</em> or <em>remark</em>. Restrict it to the sense of <em>express fully or clearly</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Student body</strong></p>

<p>A needless expression, just <em>students</em> is enough.</p>

<p><strong>Stuff</strong></p>

<p>Casual and generic. A placeholder for when the writer doesn't know the actual word or phrase. If you don't bother finding out or explaining the details, don't reference something at all.</p>

<p><strong>System</strong></p>

<p>Frequently used without necessity.</p>

> <em>They have adopted the commission system of government</em>

> <em>They have adopted government by commission.</em>

<p><strong>That</strong></p>

<p>Superfluous most of the time. Reread every sentence with <em>that</em> and see if you can leave it out.</p>

> <em>He saw that the bird was eating => He saw the bird was eating</em>

<p>Don't use it with people, the proper word is <em>who</em>.</p>

<p><strong>They</strong></p>

<p>Often incorrectly used with distributive expressions, such as <em>each </em>or<em> everybody</em>. Although they imply more than one person, they are regarded as singular.</p>

<p>Use <em>he </em>instead, unless the antecedent is or must be feminine.</p>

<p><strong>Things</strong></p>

<p>See: <em>"stuff"</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Very</strong></p>

<p>Use sparingly to exaggerate nouns. If emphasis is necessary, find a strong word.</p>

> <em>Very tired => Morose</em>

> <em>Very happy => Ecstatic</em>

<p><strong>Viewpoint</strong></p>

<p>Write <em>point of view</em>, and don't use it for <em>view</em> or <em>opinion</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Went</strong></p>

<p>Don't use <em>went</em> for every action in your story. Consider more definite statements such as walked, ran, drove, cycled.</p>

<p><strong>While</strong></p>

<p>Avoid using it in place of "<em>and" </em>or "<em>but"</em>. Instead, use a semicolon.</p>

<p>Using it for "<em>although"</em> is only allowable where this leads to no ambiguity or absurdity.</p>

<p>It's best to restrict while to the sense of <em>during the time that</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Whom</strong></p>

<p>Is used when it's the direct or indirect object. Often incorrectly used for <em>who</em> before <em>he said</em> or similar expressions.</p>

<p><strong>Worth while</strong></p>

<p>Overworked for vague (dis)approval. Restrict it to only <em>actions</em>.</p>

> <em>Is it worth while to phone him?</em>

<p>Using it before a noun (<em>a worth while visit to the zoo</em>) is terrible.</p>

<p><strong>Would</strong></p>

<p>A conditional statement in the first person requires <em>should</em>, not <em>would</em>.</p>

> <em>I should have died if he hadn't saved me.</em>

<p>The equivalent of <em>shall</em> in indirect quotation after a verb in past tense is <em>should</em>, not <em>would</em>.</p>

> <em>He said that soon enough the earth should be hit by an asteroid.</em>

<p>To express habitual or repeated action, the past tense (without <em>would</em>) is usually sufficient.</p>

> <em>Once a year he would visit his grandmother</em>

> <em>Once a year he visited his grandmother</em>

  title: "The HTML5 Guide"
  post: "<p>Without HTML, there would be no internet as we know it today. Internet in itself is nothing more than an <em>inter</em>connected <em>net</em>work of servers, and when you access such a server, you access its filesystem. For example, the homepage of nearly every website is a file called <em>index.html</em>. When your browser requests a certain URL, all it does is ask the corresponding server for that file. Once it has received it, it parses the file as HTML code and displays it in an interactive way. It might contain links pointing to other files on the same server, or even links pointing to a different server, creating that interconnected network.</p> 

<p>As you can see, a website is nothing more than a set of files on a server. The most important building block out of these is the HTML file that is requested first, which this course will teach you all about. When you're done, you can use this fundamental knowledge to continue learning the other languages of the web to craft stunning websites and maybe even games or apps.</p>

<p>Originally, the web was intended for public sharing of text only. With time, however, it has grown into a massive multimedia platform. Therefore, learning pure HTML these days isn't enough, which is why I decided to create two separate courses teaching you how to create (dynamic) graphics on the web (<strong><em>canvas</em></strong> and <strong><em>SVG</em></strong>).</p>

<p>I hope this course will be the start of your journey into the wonderful world of the web!</p>

  title: "[HTML5] What is HTML?"
  post: "<p>HTML means <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. HTML5 simply means the fifth version of the language, the one that is in development at the moment and the best so far. Most of it is implemented by all browsers---when something is not present, I'll mention it.</p> 

<p>The first thing to notice is that it isn't a <em>programming</em> or <em>scripting</em> language. It's a <strong>markup language</strong>. All it does is group text or media inside so-called tags or elements, so that each element can then be styled or programmed later on with another language. It can be written in a simple text editor, is readable by anyone, and doesn't have to be compiled. It is the most basic structure of a webpage; if your text isn't divided into different elements with specific names, you have no way of styling the text or attaching some other (programming) function to it. Also, browsers (or other web devices) have no idea about how to interpret your page.</p>

<p>This is a good thing for most people. HTML is very easy to learn and use, and after creating a few webpages you've probably seen all that there is to it. I, however, still recommend reading through the whole course, trying out the examples, and testing yourself if you really understand something. After all, <em>a good start is half the battle</em>!</p>

<h2>Creating HTML pages</h2>

<p>You can use the <strong><em>live html editor</em></strong> on this website to experiment and create, but sooner or later you'll need to have your own HTML files to play with. Using the standard simple text editor that's included with your OS is perfectly possible; just save the files with <code>.html</code> at the end and you're fine. You can then right-click and choose to open the file with your browser to preview it.</p>

<p>When your projects grow in size, however, it's useful to get a specialized editor. I recommend these:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Brackets.io (free)</li>
	<li>Sublime Text (not free)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we're ready to kick off!</p>

  title: "[HTML5] Tags & Elements"
  post: "<p>Tags define elements. An opening tag signals the start of a certain element, and a closing tag closes it. Which tag you use defines which element is created, that is, in what way the text inside the element is categorized or formatted.</p> 

<img src="media/HTMLTagsElements.png" />

<p><em>NOTE: Hover over code examples to make a test button appear. Click it to test or see the code in the live HTML editor</em></p>

<h2>Nesting Tags</h2>

<p>Because tags define groups within your webpage, you will also have to put smaller elements inside of bigger ones, and those inside even bigger ones, until you reach the top of your document. This is called nesting tags, and you can nest as many tags inside others as you like (as long as you properly open and close them). However, it is recommended to not create a very deep nesting structure, because it's hard for you to understand, and takes more loading time.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<atag>
	<anothertag>
		<lasttag>
			Content
		</lasttag>
	</anothertag>
</atag>
</pre>

<h2>Self-closing Tags</h2>

<p>A number of elements that are <em>self-closing </em>exist, because they never have any text that could be put between opening and closing tag. They require a special type of tag: <code><tagname /></code></p>

<img src="media/HTMLSelfClosingTag.png" />

<h2>Layout &amp; Semantics</h2>

<p>Most tags have some standard design rules applied to them. For example, a heading will automatically be bigger than a paragraph. It's therefore easy to get into the habit of misusing certain tags to get a layout you want.</p>

<p>Don't. HTML is for marking up your webpage, for setting up a basic structure. <strong>CSS </strong>---the next language you should learn after HTML---is for layout. A common expression in the web world is "<em>keep semantics and design completely separate</em>", which simply means that you should choose your HTML tags based on what the data inside the element <em>means</em>.</p>

<p>Text inside paragraph tags should be a paragraph, text inside a heading should be the headline of an article, text inside an emphasis tag should be in need of emphasis---you get the idea. HTML5 introduced a lot of semantic elements, which will be discussed in the last few chapters, but for now remember that we're doing absolutely nothing with layout or design just yet.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Just as with any language, HTML provides the opportunity for the developer to add comments to the code. When the page is interpreted by the computer comments are <em>completely ignored</em>, which means they don't add to loading time or change the page in any way---they only increase file size a tiny bit.</p>

<p>You can use comments to explain why you wrote certain parts in a certain way, what you still have to do, or to quickly include/exclude blocks of HTML to test which one works better.</p>

<p>Comments work like this:</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<!-- This is a comment about something -->
</pre>

<h2>Important Notes</h2>

<p>Everything in your HTML file needs to be structured using tags, which means HTML ignores whitespace and hard returns.</p>

<p>If you type multiple space characters after each other, they are automatically reduced to a single one. If you want to prevent that, you need to add a <strong>non-breaking space:</strong><code>&amp;nbsp;</code></p>

<p>If you want a <em>return</em> (or <em>enter</em>), you need to add the <strong>break</strong> tag: <code><br/></code></p>

<pre data-lang="html">
I want three spaces here: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;<br/>
And that was a line break<br/>
And another one<br/><br/>
Lots of linebreaks here.
</pre>

<p>But, keep in mind what I just told you about semantics. If you want some white space between two paragraphs, use a paragraph tag for that, not one or two <br/> tags. If you want some space between certain (emphasized) words, consider styling them with CSS later instead of using a lot of non-breaking spaces.</p>

  title: "[HTML5] Page Structure: Head & Body"
  post: "<p>Every HTML document needs a specific basic structure. This is nothing too fancy, just a few tags that determine where everything needs to be. The bare minimum for creating a web page is this small framework:</p> 

<pre data-lang="html">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Head Content -->
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- Body Content -->
  </body>
</html>
</pre>

<p>At the top is something unique, the <strong>doctype declaration</strong>. This tells the browser what version of HTML to use, but has become somewhat redundant now that nearly everything is interpreted the right way using HTML5. Nevertheless, it's wise to always include it to ensure maximum compatibility among (older versions of) browsers.</p>

<p>After the doctype comes an <strong>html</strong> tag, and your whole webpage lives inside that element. The only necessary elements are the <strong>head</strong> and the <strong>body</strong> (in that order).</p>

<h2>The Head Tag</h2>

<p>The head tag <em>describes</em> your web page---anything you put in it is not visible on the page. You can use it to add metadata such as a description, keywords and title.</p>

<p>Its primary use, however, is loading external files to use on the page, such as scripts and stylesheets.</p>

<p>More about what you can put inside the head tag can be found in the chapter <em>Head</em>.</p>

<h2>The Body Tag</h2>

<p>The body tag <em>is</em> the web page. Everything that is inside it is laid out underneath each other on the page, from top to bottom.</p>

<p>Unlike the head tag, there are <em>a lot</em> of elements you can put in there, and those will be discussed in the rest of this course.</p>

  title: "[HTML5] Attributes"
  post: "<p>Every HTML element can have <strong>attributes</strong>. They provide additional information about an element, and are often necessary in self-closing tags. Attributes are always specified in the start tag, and follow the pattern of <code><attr>attribute</attr>="value"</code>.</p> 

<p><img src="media/HTMLAttributes.png" /></p>

<p>Attributes need to be lowercase, but you can use single or double quotes for the value.</p>

<p><em>Example: Hover over <span title="Yay, a title!" style="font-weight:bold;">this piece of text</span> to see the title (tooltip) attribute in action</em></p>

<h2>Standard ("Global") Attributes</h2>

<p>The attributes presented in the table below are automatically available for every element. Pay special attention to the <code>class</code> and <code>id</code> attributes, as you'll need them a lot as you continue. You can forget the others for now.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<!-- Specifies the language used within the element, and we add our own invented attribute we could use later on when styling or scripting the element -->
<p lang="en-UK" data-something="paragraph1">This is some English text!</p>
</pre>

<p> </p>

<p>As you can see, the <code>hidden</code> attribute has only one value. This simply means that you use <code><attr>hidden</attr>="hidden"</code> if you want to hide something, and don't use this attribute at all otherwise. Elements are visible by default (which is only logical), so hiding them should be something special.</p>

<p>These types of attributes are said to be <strong>minimized</strong>, and an alternative syntax for them is to only use the attribute name, without any value. This isn't fully supported though, so I don't recommend using that form, unless you really want your code to be as small and clean as possible.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it's unwise to use the <strong>lang</strong> attribute on every element. Usually it is set once in the html tag: <code><html lang="en-US"></code>.</p>

<p>Most of these aren't very important though, for most standard tags in HTML are without any of these attributes. But, self-closing tags don't have content, which means they rely on attributes to fill in the gaps. The same used to be true for some elements like tables (you can set the width and height as attributes), but as I said earlier: it's recommended to keep style and design separate from the mark up. You'll see these important attributes later on when I talk about the specific tag they belong to.</p>

<p>Now we can finally start learning all the actual tags and elements!</p>

  title: "[HTML5] Blocks"
  post: "<p>The concept of HTML blocks is usually saved for last, because it is totally anti-semantic and doesn't have much use at this particular moment. Nevertheless, it forms a <em>very</em> large part of the modern web, and I think it should be one of the first things you learn. It's very simple actually, but I only saw them for the first time after about 6 months of trying to create something with HTML, and I could then throw away a half year's work.</p> 

<h2>Meet the block elements</h2>

<p>There are two block elements:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code><div></code> Short for division, which means this is simply a way of grouping content again and again. But it doesn't tell you what type of group it creates, which means that the div is mostly used for structuring the document and styling it. It actually creates a block around everything that's inside it, and elements before or after it are placed completely above or below it. It is therefore called a <em>block-level element</em>.</li>
	<li><code><span></code> Does the same as div, but is an <em>inline element</em>. This means that it doesn't create a block around the elements inside, but keeps those elements within the same line. Mostly used for identifying small elements, like a number that needs to be coloured red, or a catchphrase that has to be made fancy.</li>
</ul>

<pre data-lang="html">
<div>
  A big block grouped together<br/>
  An <span>inline alteration</span> in the mark up
</div>
</pre>

<p>At the end of this course, we will look at some specific tags that have been introduced for HTML5, that do the same thing but <em>are</em> semantic.</p>

<h2>Horizontal Rule</h2>

<p>Before HTML5, the <code><hr></code> (or <code><hr/></code>) tag was used to define a horizontal line---it was purely for layout. Nowadays though, it has shifted towards a more semantic meaning: to separate content or define a thematic break. Not every browser displays the actual line anymore, and if you want a horizontal line you should do so using CSS.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
Text, article, whatever.
<hr/>
Discussing something else under the line.
</pre>

  title: "[HTML5] Paragraphs & Headings"
  post: "<p>Most of the web consists of articles. Blogs, news websites, tutorial websites (like this one), you name it. And as you probably know, every article consists of a heading, multiple subheadings, and text divided into paragraphs. That's why HTML has good support for multiple headings and paragraphs.</p> 

<h2>Headings</h2>

<p>You have 6 tags available to you: <code><h1></code> up to and including <code><h6></code>.</p>

<p>These are all block-level elements, which are automatically bold and scaled from large to small respectively. However, it shouldn't be their design that interests you. Search engines in particular, scan a page for headings to see what the most important keywords or phrases are. You should only use the first header tag once on your page. And no, not for your logo or company one-liner. Use the first header for the actual title of the article or page, and then move your way downwards for every sublevel of headers.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<h1>Biggest heading</h1>
<h2>Less Big</h2>
<h3>Neutral</h3>
<h4>Neutral</h4>
<h5>Small</h5>
<h6>Tiniest Heading</h6>
</pre>

<h2>Paragraphs</h2>

<p>Paragraphs are the easiest of them all: a simple <code><p></code> tag does wonders.</p>

<p>Paragraphs are block-level elements as well, but they don't have their font size or style altered in any other way. They are "clean", so to speak, and really allow you to focus on the text inside.</p>

  title: "[HTML5] Links"
  post: "<p>Links are vital to any webpage. Without (hyper)links, the only way to access anything on your site would be by typing out the full URL. Not only is that an unnecessarily large amount of work, it is also impossible for everyone to know and remember those URLs.</p> 

<p>At the time HTML was invented, however, the concept of hyperlinks wasn't yet in existence. Some other functionality was also desired, and they decided to group those into so-called <strong>anchor points</strong>.</p>

<p>When you let down the anchor of a ship, you lock the ship into a position. Anything can happen on the ship, it may even move a bit with the movement of the water, but it will always be tied to that anchor point.</p>

<p>An HTML anchor point works the same way. It simply says that whatever is inside it is linked to a certain other spot. This may be another website, or a spot within the same page. The other website may change some things, but the link still exists and points to the same spot. Linking within the same page then requires two anchor points, because the anchor refers to a specific thing within the ship, and that thing needs to be tied up as well.</p>

<p>This may all seem a bit vague or complicated, but it's actually very simple once we see it in detail.</p>

<h2>Anchor Tag</h2>

<p>As expected, the anchor tag looks like this:</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax"><a href="<em>URL</em>"> <em>link text</em> </a></code></p>

<p>As you can see, the link doesn't have to be text. If you want, you can put whole pages within a link, but the biggest links on a page are usually large headers or images. The URL it links to is set within the <code>href</code> attribute.</p>

<p>When linking to something on your own website, you can work with <strong>relative links</strong>: you simply leave out the domain name and only put the filename into the <em>href attribute</em>. Your browser will automatically interpret it as a file on the server it's currently on.</p>

<p>NOTE: Text within an anchor element is automatically styled blue and underlined.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<a href="http://google.com">This is a link to Google!</a>
<a href="contact.html">This is a link to the page contact.html on the same website</a>
</pre>

<h2>Target</h2>

<p>The <code>target</code> attribute can easily be confused with the <em>href attribute</em>, but they do something completely different. The best way to keep them apart is to remember that <em>href</em> stands for <strong>hyperlink reference</strong>, while the target attribute specifies <strong>where</strong> to open the link.</p>

<p>There are two options:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>_blank:</code> opens in a new window or tab</li>
	<li><code>_top:</code> opens in full body of same window or tab</li>
</ul>

<p>There's also two other values the target attribute can obtain, but those are specific to frames, and therefore discussed in the <em>iframes</em> chapter.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Opens google in a new window or tab (depends on browser)</a>
</pre>

<h2>Local Linking</h2>

<p>This requires two anchor points: the anchor/hyperlink, and the spot on the page that is being linked to.</p>

<p>The spot linked to needs to have a <code>name</code> attribute set; the value can be anything.</p>

<p>The anchor needs to have a hyperlink reference of the form <code>#name</code>.</p>

<p>The rest is automatically taken care of by the browser!</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<!-- This anchor point is put at the top of a certain section of a page -->
<a name="somename"></a>
<!-- This is an actual hyperlink -->
<a href="somepage.html#name">Link to that specific section on the page somepage.html</a>

  title: "[HTML5] Images"
  post: "<p>Images are pretty straightforward. You create images by using the self-closing <code><img /></code> tag. There are two important attributes you need to supply.</p> 

> <code><attr>src</attr>="url"</code>: src stands for <em>source</em> and needs a URL pointing to an image file. This can be a relative link to a file on your own server, or a link to an image on another website.

> <code><attr>alt</attr>="text"</code>: the alt text is displayed when the image can't be loaded. When the link to the image is broken, or somebody uses a screen reader, the alt text will tell them what should have been there.

<pre data-lang="html">
<img src="somefile.jpg" alt="This is some file" />
</pre>

<h2>Image Formats</h2>

<p>The most common image format on the web is .<strong>jpg</strong> or .<strong>png</strong> (with transparency), and .<strong>gif</strong> for animated images. They are known for their small file size and therefore quick loading times. But, HTML supports nearly all image formats, so anything goes really.</p>

<p>NOTE: Always specify the size (width and height) of (large) images with CSS. If you don't, the page will change layout all the time while the image is loading, because it is adjusting to the current image dimensions in real time.</p>

<h2>Image Maps</h2>

<p>If you want to define certain special (clickable) areas on an image, you need to use image maps.</p>

<p>The <code><map></code> tag introduces a set of areas to be mapped, which are defined with the <code><area /></code> tag.</p>

<p>Linking an image with its map is done by giving your <em>img tag</em> the attribute <code><attr>usemap</attr>="#namehere"</code>, and your <em>map tag</em> the attribute <code><attr>name</attr>="namehere"</code> (just like with local anchor points).</p>

<p>Defining your areas is done by using one of these three attribute pairs (for a rectangle, circle or polygon, respectively):</p>

<code class="longsyntax">shape="rect" coords="x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>"
shape="circle" coords="x,y,radius"
shape="poly" coords="x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;.,x<sub>n</sub>,y<sub>n</sub>"</code>

<p>And lastly, an <code>href</code> attribute is provided to define what the area links to.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<img src="somefile.png" alt="This is an image" usemap="#imagemap">

<map name="imagemap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,100,100" href="somepage.html" alt="Links to some page">
  <area shape="circle" coords="0,0,50" href="anotherpage.html" alt="Links to another page">

  title: "[HTML5] Lists"
  post: "<p>There are three types of lists: ordered, unordered and description. Because we want our HTML to strictly define what category a certain piece of text belongs to, we need a different set of tags for each of them. But luckily, the basic idea and structure remain the same.</p> 

<h2>How Lists Work</h2>

<p>Lists work by telling the browser when it wants to start one, and then using a list tag to define when one particular list item starts (and ends). An abstract list structure looks like this:</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<!-- General structure of HTML lists -->
<listcontainer>
  <listitem> Content </listitem>
  <listitem> Content </listitem>
</listcontainer>
</pre>

<p>If you accidentally put text in there without list item tags surrounding it, the text would still be indented (because it is within a list element), but it wouldn't have a bullet or number in front of it.</p>

<h2>Ordered Lists</h2>

<p>Lists where the items need to be in a particular order; a step-by-step plan, a top 10 of greatest love songs, etcetera. Such a list is started with the <code><ol></code> tag, and every list item is introduced with the <code><li></code> tag.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<ol>
  <li> Content </li>
  <li> Content </li>
</ol>
</pre>

<p>You can use the <code>type</code> attribute to define whether to use numbers ( <em>1, 2, &hellip;</em> ), roman numbers ( <em>I or i</em> ) or letters ( <em>A or a</em> ) in front of the list items, but I recommend defining this in the CSS and leaving the HTML clean.</p>

<h2>Unordered Lists</h2>

<p>Lists where the items need not be in a particular order; a collection of tips and tricks, a grocery list, etcetera. Such a list is started with the <code><ul></code> tag, and also uses <code><li></code> for the items.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<ul>
  <li> Content </li>
  <li> Content </li>
</ul>
</pre>

<h2>Description Lists</h2>

<p>A list of terms with a description for each of them. These are started with the <code><dl></code> tag. The definition is within an <code><dt></code> element, while the corresponding decription is put underneath it with <code><dd></code></p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<dl>
  <dt> Definition </dt>
    <dd> Description </dd>
  <dt> Definition </dt>
    <dd> Description </dd>
</dl>

  title: "[HTML5] Text Formatting"
  post: "<p>Lots of times within this course, I have made important words stand out by making them <strong>bold</strong> or <em>emphasized</em>. This isn't done by pure CSS, but with special (semantic) HTML tags. Those words and phrases I highlighted not only need to look like they stand out, they actually are the most important ones of the story, and therefore need to have the same added importance within the HTML. All the formatting tags are regular ones which are easy to understand, so I've put together a nice table for you.</p> 

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Tag</p>
			</td>

	</tbody>
</table>

<p>I recommend using the <code><b></code>, <code><i></code> and <code><small></code> elements sparingly. The effect they create can easily be reproduced by using CSS, which robs them of all their functionality really.</p>

<p>The inserted and deleted text are for showing edits---after the article was published some parts turned out to be false, or some new information was discovered, and that's the semantic importance of these tags.</p>

  title: "[HTML5] Code Formatting"
  post: "<p>One tricky area for a markup language is how to format (computer) code. If you'd just throw the computer code inside some paragraph tags, HTML would strip it of all formatting and maybe even interpret some of it as HTML code, making the whole incomprehensible. On top of that, anything related to computers is not normal text, and therefore needs to have their own tag for maintaining your high semantic standards.</p> 

<p>That's why the <code><pre></code> tag has been invented, for <strong>preformatted text</strong>. Anything inside it will keep its formatting and will not wrap if the element is too small for what's inside.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<pre>
Some
Text
That
  Needs
To Keep
  Its
    Formatting
</pre>
</pre>

<p>If you only need only a single line of code, you can use the <code><code></code> tag. For example, everytime I present syntax or "code words" to you, I wrap it inside this element.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<code>var i = 2;</code>
</pre>

<p>For computer <strong>output</strong>, the result of executing that code, you have to use the <code><samp></code> tag.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<samp>Error 102589: i already defined! Stopped execution. </samp>
</pre>

<p>For <strong>keyboard input</strong> is the <code><kbd></code> tag, and (mathematical) variables have the <code><var></code> tag.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<kbd>File | Save As .. </kbd>
<var>E = mc<sup>2</sup></var>
</pre>

<p>All of these have their own important specific uses, but the <code><pre></code> tag is by far the most commonly used. For instance, all code examples on this website are wrapped inside one.</p>

  title: "[HTML5] Quotations & Citations"
  post: "<p>We've already seen tags to format small bits of text and (computer) code on your web page, which means there's only one thing left that we haven't discussed yet: blocks of text that refer to another source or have a greater meaning.</p> 

<h2>Quotations</h2>
<p>When dealing with short (inline) quotations, the very simple <code><q></code> tag is used. Browsers usually automatically add quotes around it.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<q>A nice quote here</q>
</pre>

<h2>Blockquotes</h2>

<p>A quote larger than that is called a blockquote, and therefore needs the <code><blockquote></code> tag.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<blockquote>A nice, BIG quote here spanning multiple lines</blockquote>
</pre>

<h2>Citations</h2>

<p>To cite something, usually the title of a work, you use the <code><cite></code> tag.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<cite>To be, or not to be. That is the question. </cite>
</pre>

<h2>Abbreviations</h2>

<p>If you're using an abbreviation or acronym, it's best to wrap it inside the <code><abbr></code> tag. This allows you to add a title attribute that shows the full word or phrase when you hover over the abbreviation.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<abbr title="World Wildlife Fund" >WWF</abbr>
</pre>

<h2>Contact Information</h2>

<p>For displaying contact information, the <code><address></code> tag can help. Most browsers add a line break before and after the element, and display the text in italics.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<address>Somestreet 21<br/>England</address>
</pre>

<h2>Text Direction</h2>

<p>If a certain piece of text needs to be displayed from right to left instead of the usual left to right, you can use the so-called <code><bdo></code> tag, which stands for <strong>bi-directional override</strong>. The tag itself does nothing---you still need to add the <code>dir</code> attribute.</p>

<bdo dir="rtl" >Some Arabic text maybe.</bdo>

  title: "[HTML5] Tables"
  post: "<p>Tables are used to display tabular data. This may sound obvious, but tables are misused far too often for layout purposes. Tables automatically distribute the width and height evenly among its cells, which is why people think they are perfect for responsive websites. If the user resizes the browser window, all elements on your page, such as the main content and sidebar, are automatically scaled with it. But semantically, you couldn't be more wrong. You should only use tables for displaying data that is best displayed using rows and columns (<em>tabular data</em>). For example: competition results in the soccer league, financial figures of the last quartile, or to teach some concept in a concise manner (as I use it frequently on this website).</p> 

<h2>The <table>, <tr> and <td> tags</h2>

<p>If you want, you can view tables as a combination of two lists: rows and columns.</p>

<p>The <code><table></code> tag introduces a table, while the <code><tr></code> tag starts a table row (horizontal list), which contains <code><td></code> tags that contain table data. Those make up the columns, or (vertical) lists.</p>

<p>HTML expects you to get the correct amount of cells in every row, which is determined by the first row. If you put one cell less in the second row, it will just leave a gap in the table. If you put one cell more in the second row, it will add it as if it were an extra column, but the whole layout and structure will be destroyed.</p>

<p>By default, tables are only as wide and high as they need to be to contain all the table data. That, however, makes for a very messy look, so the first thing people usually do is stretching the table to 100% using CSS, and increasing the white space around the rows and columns.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</pre>

<h2>Table Headings</h2>

<p>Most tables have certain categories displayed in the top row. These define what is inside the table, and therefore need their own tag. Instead of <td>, you need to use the <code><th></code> tag.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Column 1</th>
    <th>Column 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Content</td>
    <td>Other Content</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</pre>

<p>Table headings are automatically embolded.</p>

<h2>Irregular Tables</h2>

<p>Some tables have a cell that spans multiple rows, or multiple columns. These properties can <em>not</em> be set with CSS, and therefore need to be added to the corresponding elements as attributes:</p>

<p><code><attr>colspan</attr>="value"</code>: how many columns a cell spans. Default is 1, increasing the number makes the cell wider towards the right.</p>

<p><code><attr>rowspan</attr>="value"</code>: how many rows a cell spans. Default is 1, increasing the number makes the cell larger towards the bottom.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<!-- USING COLSPAN -->
<table>
  <tr>
    <!-- Category with only one cell needed -->
    <th>Name</th>
    <!-- Category spanning multiple cells -->
    <th colspan="2">Favourite Food</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Adam Johnson</td>
    <td>Apples</td>
    <td>Bread</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<!-- USING ROWSPAN -->
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <td>Adam Johnson</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Favourite Food</th>
    <td>Apples</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bread</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</pre>

<p>As you can see in the example, if you increase one of these attributes, you need to count yourself how many cells you need to leave out in the next column(s) or row(s) respectively.</p>

<h2>Captions</h2>

<p>Captions are titles for your table. They should follow the <table> tag immediately, and are automatically centred above the table. They are created with the <code><caption></code> tag.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<table>
  <caption>SOME CAPTION</caption>
  <tr>
    <td>Content</td>
    <td>Other Content</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</pre>

<h2>Grouping Tags</h2>

<p>You can't use a div or span to group multiple rows, columns or cells for semantic or layout matters, which is why some grouping tags were invented.</p>

<table>
	<tr><td>Element</td><td>Description</td></tr>
	<tr><td><code><colgroup></code></td><td>Groups multiple columns</td></tr>
	<tr><td><code><col></code></td><td>Specifies properties for one column</td></tr>
	<tr><td><code><thead></code></td><td>Groups the header content</td></tr>
	<tr><td><code><tbody></code></td><td>Groups the body content</td></tr>
	<tr><td><code><tfoot></code></td><td>Groups the footer content</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <thead> and <tbody> elements are often automatically inserted by browsers when parsing your page.</p>

  title: "[HTML5] Forms"
  post: "<p>Forms in HTML are, just as in the real world, used to collect user input. You log in to websites using a form, send mails using a form, upload a blog post, send a tweet---the list goes on and on. It's therefore not strange that forms are quite a large topic in HTML, and therefore split up into 4 chapters. This one will discuss the basic structure, while the others go over all the possibilities you have for populating your forms.</p> 

<h2>The <form> tag</h2>

<p>Forms are enclosed by <code><form></code> tags. You can put any HTML you want within a form element, but a form element can never submit data from elements that are <em>not</em> inside it.</p>

<h2>The Action Attribute</h2>

<p>Because HTML itself was not made to actually <em>do</em> things---like manipulating data---you need to specify the action that needs to be performed by the form. This action means moving to a different file that can handle the input. Therefore, there's an <code>action</code> attribute that takes a link to a file/page as value.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<form action="processingpage.html">
  Form Elements Here
</form>
</pre>

<p>When the input is dealt with, the user is usually referred back with a message saying submission was successful (or not). Not only is this user-friendly, but it also protects this vulnerable action page (because it contains user input data).</p>

<p>NOTE: The form only moves to the action page when the user presses a submit button within the form. It doesn't send the data there straight away or "in real-time".</p>

<h2>The Method Attribute</h2>

<p>There are two ways to perform the action, using the <strong>GET</strong> method and the <strong>POST </strong>method. These are specified as <code><attr>method</attr>="GET"</code> or <code><attr>method</attr>="POST"</code> attributes in the form tag. Use&hellip;</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>GET</code> when the submission is passive and doesn't contain sensitive information. The GET method passes on the data using parameters in the URL. It is quick, but has size limitations and is best suited to short amounts of data.</li>
	<li><code>POST</code> when the form is updating data or includes sensitive information (e.g., passwords). The submitted data is not visible to anybody accessing the page, which means it offers better security and can handle larger amounts of data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Name Attribute</h2>

<p>Every form-related element can take a <code>name</code> attribute, which can take any value you want to give it. This attribute is very important: only elements with a specified name attribute are included on submission. When you learn other web languages that can deal with user input, you'll see that those names are vital to retrieving the data.</p>

<h2>Fieldset and Legend</h2>

<p>To group related data within a form, you can use the <code><fieldset></code> element. The <code><legend></code> element defines a caption or title for this group, and follows the <fieldset> tag immediately (just as with tables and captions).</p>

<h2>Labels</h2>

<p>The <code><label></code> tag defines a label for an input element, such as a description of the option a checkbox represents or question you need to answer in a text field.</p>

<h2>Basic Form Example</h2>

<pre data-lang="html">
<form action="processingpage.html" method="POST">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Textual input</legend>
    <input name="username" type="text" /> 
    <input name="fullName" type="text" /> 
  </fieldset>
</form>

  title: "[HTML5] The Input Element"
  post: "<p>The input element is the heart and soul of every form.</p> 

<p>It is represented by the <em>self-closing</em> <code><input /></code> tag, which is a special one: its role changes completely based on the <code>type</code> attribute.</p>

<h2>Text</h2>

<p>To define a one-line input field for text input, use <code><input <attr>type</attr>="text" /></code>.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<form>
    Please type your username: 
  <input type="text" /> 
</form>
</pre>

<h2>Passwords</h2>

<p>To define a password field, use <code><input <attr>type</attr>="password" /></code>. Password fields are simply input fields, but with asterisks/dots to hide what you type.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<form>
    Please type password:
  <input type="password" /> 
</form>
</pre>

<h2>Radio</h2>

<p>To define a radio button, use <code><input <attr>type</attr>="radio" /></code>. Radio buttons let a user select <em>only one</em> of a number of options. Options belong together when they have the same <em>name</em>.</p>

<p>By default, when the page loads, the none of the radio buttons is selected.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<form>
    Gender:
  <input type="radio" /> Male  
  <input type="radio" /> Female 
  <input type="radio" /> Both?
</form>
</pre>

<h2>Checkbox</h2>

<p>To define a checkbox, use <code><input <attr>type</attr>="checkbox" /></code>. Checkboxes let you turn a certain option or possibility on/off, which means each one can be chosen individually and needs a different name.</p>

<p>By default, when the page loads, all checkboxes are off.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<form>
    Which fruit(s) would you like to buy?
  <input type="checkbox" /> Apple
  <input type="checkbox" /> Berries
  <input type="checkbox" /> Pear
  <input type="checkbox" /> Kiwi
  <input type="checkbox" /> Banana
</form>
</pre>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>The submit button of a form is created with <code><input <attr>type</attr>="submit" /></code>. It automatically submits the form, which means no additional scripting or anything of the kind is needed. The button has a default text that reads 'submit' in the browser's language, but you can easily change that using the <code>value</code> attribute.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<form>
    <input type="submit" value="SEND THIS THING!" />
</form>
</pre>

<h2>Button</h2>

<p>A simple button is created with <code><input <attr>type</attr>="button" /></code>. This button has the standard look, feel and animations of a button---but it doesn't do anything. Any function should be given to it via a scripting language.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<form>
    <input type="button" value="Clicking this button doesn't send the form, but probably does some other extremely useful things" />
</form>

</pre>

<h2>File</h2>

<p>An input field that holds a file is created with <code><input <attr>type</attr>="file" /></code>. The way this works depends on the browser and operating system of the user. It's used with forms for uploading files.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<form>
    Please upload a profile picture:
    <input type="file" />
</form>
</pre>

<h2>HTML5 (Text) Types</h2>

<p>These types have been added in HTML5, but not all of them are supported by all browsers. If a browser doesn't support it, it will display a regular one-line text field. If it is supported, the browser will automatically display some extra helpful tools or, in some rare cases, standard layout.</p>

  title: "[HTML5] Input Attributes"
  post: "<p>The important <code><input></code> element has a lot of attributes that can help define or restrict the expected input.</p> 

<p>All of these attributes are simply for making clear what you expect from your users and improving the layout. They can be changed by anybody who knows something about HTML, which means you will need to write code on the server to check if the data is within your restrictions.</p>

<h2>The value attribute</h2>

<p>The <code>value</code> attribute specifies an initial value for an input field.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<input type="submit" value="Submit Me!" />
</pre>

<h2>The readonly attribute</h2>

<p>The <code>readonly</code> attribute specifies that an input field is <em>read only</em> and cannot be changed.</p>

<p><em>Why would you want to include a readonly input field? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of input?</em> Well, for example, sometimes the form needs to send additional data that is not input by the user, but generated by the browser or server. That data is usually put into a (hidden) readonly field.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
Your ID number: <input type="text" value="06869359503" readonly />
</pre>

<p>May be minimized; <code>readonly</code> means the same as <code><attr>readonly</attr>="readonly"</code></p>

<h2>The disabled attribute</h2>

<p>The <code>disabled</code> attribute specifies that an input field is disabled. A disabled element is un-usable, un-clickable and will not be submitted.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<input type="submit" value="Can&apos;t Submit (Not all required fields filled)" disabled />
</pre>

<p>May be minimized; <code>disabled</code> means the same as <code><attr>disabled</attr>="disabled"</code></p>

<h2>The selected attribute</h2>

<p>The <code>selected</code> attribute specifies that an input field is selected. For example, you can pre-select a few checkboxes or a certain radiobutton.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
What is your favourite food?
<input type="radio" name="radioGroup" value="Apples" />
<input type="radio" name="radioGroup" value="Bananas" selected />
<input type="radio" name="radioGroup" value="Pears" />
</pre>

<p>May be minimized; <code>selected</code> means the same as <code><attr>selected</attr>="selected"</code></p>

<h2>The maxlength attribute</h2>

<p>The <code>maxlength</code> attribute specifies a maximum allowed length (in characters) for an input field. It doesn't provide any feedback---if the user crosses the limit, it simply doesn't register keypresses anymore.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
Username: <input type="text" maxlength="10" placeholder="Maximum 10 characters" />
</pre>

<h2>HTML5 Attributes</h2>

<p>These attributes have been introduced in HTML5 and are mostly implemented, but not completely supported everywhere yet. If it's not supported, it will just be ignored---your page will still load perfectly fine.</p>

  title: "[HTML5] Form Elements"
  post: "<p>Besides the input element, there are a few other very important elements in the world of forms. I will discuss those handful here, and that will wrap up this section of multiple chapters about forms.</p> 

<h2>Textareas</h2>

<p>If you want more than a one-line input field, so-called text areas are the way to go. They are created with the <code><textarea></code> tag. If you want some text already in it, you can simply put that within the element.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<textarea>Text already inside.</textarea>
</pre>

<p>Every browser automatically adds the possibility to resize textareas by dragging the lower right corner. They only way to prevent that, is via CSS.</p>

<h2>Drop-Down Lists</h2>

<p>A drop-down list is a list that appears below the input field when you click on it. You can then choose one of the options as your input. The <code><select></code> element defines a drop-down list, while the <code><option></code> element defines an option. The text within the option element is what is displayed to the user, but what's within the <code>value</code> attribute is what is submitted.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
What is your favourite fruit?
<select>
  <option value="A">Apples</option>
  <option value="B">Bananas</option>
  <option value="P">Pears</option>
</select>
</pre>

<p>By default, when the page loads, the first item is selected. You can use the <em>selected</em> attribute, from the previous chapter, to select another by default.</p>

<h2>Buttons</h2>

<p>Just as the input buttons, these do nothing by default. It simply creates a clickable button, and you have to script any function you want it to have. They are created with the <code><button></code> tag, whatever text is inside the element is displayed on the button.</p>

<h2>Datalist</h2>

<p>Datalists are used to give a list of pre-defined options with an input text field. You can type anything you want into the field, but a list of options will appear underneath for you to quickly click or see what kind of answer is expected from the answer. If you want to restrict the input field to only those pre-defined inputs, you'll be better off with checkboxes or radio buttons. A datalist is created with the <code><datalist></code> tag, which holds <em>self closing</em> <code><option></code> tags that display all options. This datalist is then linked with an input field using the <code>id</code> and <code>list</code> attributes:</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<input list="fruit">

<datalist id="fruit">
  <option value="Apples">
  <option value="Bananas">
  <option value="Pears">
</datalist>
</pre>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>The <code><output></code> element represents the result of a calculation. HTML, however, still can't do scripting or programming tasks, so the calculation still has to be performed using another scripting language. Therefore, this element mostly has semantical value: anywhere something is calculated, you use this element to display the result. It takes a <code>for</code> attribute that contains the <code>id</code>s of the fields that went into the calculation, split by a white space. Unless you've learnt JavaScript already, I suggest leaving this element alone for now.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<form oninput="result.value=parseInt(a.value)+parseInt(b.value)">
  0 <input type="range" id="a" value="50"> 100
   + <input type="number" id="b" value="50">
   = <output name="result" for="a b"></output>
</form>

  title: "[HTML5] Iframes"
  post: "<p>The very last (basic) element we still have to discuss, is the <code><iframe></code> tag. Iframe is short for <em>interactive frame</em>, which simply means that you load another webpage within a frame on your own webpage. Iframes are often viewed as clumsy and nasty elements, but sometimes there's simply no workaround. For example, the Live HTML editor you've seen throughout this course, uses an Iframe to load your code from.</p> 

<h2>Linking</h2>

<p>To tell the iframe what URL to display, you need to specify an <code>src</code> attribute. If you leave it out, the iframe is simply left blank. Any text you put within the iframe element is <em>only</em> displayed if the user's browser doesn't support iframes.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<iframe src="http://google.com">Sorry, your browser doesn&apos;t support iframes</iframe>
</pre>

<h2>Target</h2>

<p>In the chapter on <em>anchor points</em> we've already seen the target attribute and two of its values: <code>_blank</code> and <code>_top</code>. Now that we know about frames, we can add two three more:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>_self</code>: opens the link in the same frame</li>
	<li><code>_parent</code>: opens the link in the parent frame. For example, if you have a single iframe on your webpage, the parent frame of that iframe is your webpage itself.</li>
	<li><code><iframe name></code>: opens the link in the iframe with its name attribute set to the specified value.</li>
</ul>

<pre data-lang="html">
<a href="http://google.com" target="theFrame">Open it in the frame!</a>
<iframe name="theFrame"></iframe>

  title: "[HTML5] Head"
  post: "<p>The <code><head></code> tag has been mentioned earlier, but without any specifics. Here I will give a brief overview of all the elements it can contain.</p> 

<h2>The <title> element</h2>

<p>The <code><title></code> tag defines a title for the document. It has three primary uses:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It defines a title in the browser tab</li>
	<li>It displays a title for the page in search engine results</li>
	<li>It provides a title for the page when it is bookmarked or added to favourites</li>
</ul>

<p>If you leave it out, the title of the page will just be its URL. I strongly recommend always using a meaningful title tag within your page.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<title>Professional Panda</title>
</pre>

<h2>The <base> element</h2>

<p>The <code><base></code> element specifies the base URL and base target for all anchor points on the page. Relative links will start at the base URL, and all links with no target set will follow this base target. The base element has <strong>no end tag</strong>.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<base href="http://somesite.com/somepath/" target="_blank">
</pre>

<h2>The <meta> element</h2>

<p>The <code><meta /></code> element provides metadata about the document. That metadata is never displayed, and can come in many different forms.</p>

<p>The type of metadata it contains can be defined using several different attributes. A <code>content</code> attribute is used to specify the value of that metadata.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Attribute</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<meta name="author" content="Tom Cruise">

<h2>Loading/Linking External Files</h2>

<p>The <code><script></code> tag loads an external script file into the page (e.g., JavaScript).</p>

<p>The <code><link></code> tag links a different type of external file (e.g., CSS).</p>

<p>The <code><style></code> tag is used to write CSS within the HTML page itself. I don't recommend using this, keep markup and layout separate!</p>

<p>Each of these tags will be elaborated on further in their corresponding courses.</p>

  title: "[HTML5] Charsets, Symbols & Entities"
  post: "<p>In the chapter on the <em>head</em> tag, we briefly discussed setting a <strong>charset</strong> for the document. Charset is an abbreviation for <em>character set</em>, which is simply the set of all possible characters. It's an enormous list of codes that represent lowercase letters, uppercase letters, punctuation symbols, accents, etcetera.</p> 

<p>UTF-8 is the default charset for HTML. It contains <em>a lot</em> of characters, more than you'll ever need, but it also contains the vital ones that you'll run into very often. There's two reasons why you could need to use a symbol or entity from a charset: there's no way to simply type the symbol with your keyboard, or the symbol is used in HTML.</p>

<p>The first reasons depends a bit on your computer setup of course, but the second one is a recurring problem among HTML beginners. For example, say you want to use a <em>smaller than</em> ( < ) symbol. If you'd just type it, HTML would think you were starting a tag and do crazy things. There's no other way to solve this problem than by using entities.</p>

<h2>Forming Symbols and Entities</h2>

<p>There's actually no distinction between symbols and entities---both work in exactly the same way. The only reason I'm calling them separately here is because there is a difference in their function. Entities replace characters used within HTML, while symbols are special characters that may not be present on your keyboard. Entities are necessary, symbols are often fancy.</p>

<p>There are two ways to write them: <strong>&amp;entityname; </strong>or <strong>&amp;#hexcode;</strong></p>

<p>Of course, it's far easier to remember them or see what an entity means if you only use the way with the <em>entityname</em> in it. However, not all of them have names, and a lot of the names are not so straightforward, so it really doesn't matter which way you write them.</p>

<p>Some common ones are:</p>

<h2>List of all HTML5 entities</h2>

<p>Just for you, I have compiled a list of <em>all</em> entities available in UTF-8, the HTML5 standard. Use it as a reference or "html5 google" if you need a certain entity or symbol when creating a webpage.</p>

<p>NOTE: Not all fonts have all entities, you can only be sure of that if you buy professional fonts.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: Not all browsers support all entities, but their support---at this moment---is big enough that I suspect you won't run into any problems.</p>

  title: "[HTML5] Audio & Video"
  post: "<p>We've seen text, pictures, and all sorts of interactive elements. What we haven't yet seen, is anything related to audio or video. You might think that this is more difficult than everything we've discussed so far, but in HTML5 this has actually become really easy.</p> 

<h2>The <audio> tag</h2>

<p>An audio block is defined by the <code><audio></code> tag. Within the audio element you have to supply the source, which is done with the <code><source></code> tag. The source tag, ironically, takes the <code><attr>src</attr></code> attribute and another <code><attr>type</attr></code> attribute that specifies the type of file in the source.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<audio>
  <source src="somefile.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="somefile.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Sorry, your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
</pre>

<p>Any text placed within the <audio> tag is displayed if the user's browser can't play the audio.</p>

<p>Only three audio formats are supported:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>.mp3</strong>, audio/mpeg</li>
	<li><strong>.wav</strong>, audio/wav</li>
	<li><strong>.ogg</strong>, audio/ogg</li>
</ul>

<h2>The <video> tag</h2>

<p>The <code><video></code> tag works exactly the same way, but for video.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<video>
  <source src="somefile.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="somefile.mp4" type="audio/mp4">
Sorry, your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
</pre>

<p>Only three video formats are supported:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>.mp4</strong>, video/mp4</li>
	<li><strong>.webm</strong>, video/webm</li>
	<li><strong>.ogg</strong>, video/ogg</li>
</ul>

<h2>Awesome Attributes</h2>

<p>The browser will take care of the rest. But, there are two (minimized) attributes you can set (within the opening <code><audio></code> or <code><video></code> tag):</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>autoplay</code>, if you want to automatically play the audio/video</li>
	<li><code>controls</code>, if you want to display controls with the audio/video. How these look and work depend on the browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want more functionality, you'll have to script it yourself---HTML is not meant for that.</p>

<h2>The <object> tag</h2>

<p>If you need any other type of media on your page, you'll have to resort to the <code><object></code> tag. This tag only signals the browser that a special object is on the page. To actually make such an object element work, the browser would have to natively support that specific media type or the user has to install a plugin. The object it represents is provided with the <code>data</code> attribute. You <em>can</em> specify the type with the <code>type</code> attribute.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<object data="someCoolGame.swf"></object>
</pre>

<p>NOTE: HTML5 introduced the <code><embed></code> tag which works exactly the same way. At the moment, I haven't (yet) discovered why you should use one over the other. Do whatever you like.</p>

  title: "[HTML5] HTML5 Elements"
  post: "<p>Because this whole course has been HTML5, we've already seen the majority of extra features and elements. The only thing, in the whole HTML world, that's left to learn are the new <strong>semantic</strong> (or structural) <strong>elements</strong> in HTML5. These elements do nothing else than create structure in your document---they should replace <code><span></code> or <code><div></code> tags whenever possible.</p> 

<p>I suggest you read through this list, and then look back whenever you start a new project to see if you can create a good (semantic) structure with these tags. Most of them have no default layout attached to them, which means structuring your document well from the beginning only has advantages!</p>

  title: "[HTML5] Conclusion: what now?"
  post: "<p>That's it. You've seen everything that's in the HTML universe, but there's still a lot you haven't learnt. How to design a webpage, for example. Or how to create a fancy intro animation or layout that changes if the user resizes the browser window. Or how to read data from a server to display as a blog post.</p> 

<p>These are all controlled by other languages. This may sound as if you have to learn a dozen different syntaxes, but luckily all those languages are among the easiest and tie in with each other. They all have HTML at their core, and all their functionality is based on styling or manipulating it.</p>

<p>If you haven't already, I suggest you play with this awesome mark up language a bit. Maybe try to build a few webpages for one or two days, or just read the whole course again to see if you understand everything. But, after you've done that, you should forget about reading up on HTML and start learning the other languages. HTML is simple and small, the languages that make it beautiful and great are more complex and require more of your time. And in the end---if there's something you don't know or understand, you can simply <em>look it up on the internet</em>. (funny, how people read webpages to learn how to create webpages.)</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>CSS:</strong> Cascading Style Sheets. Used for visual design and usability (how a website works, functions and feels).</li>
	<li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Scripting language. Used for adding any dynamic behaviour to the website---moving pieces, animations, drag and drop, etcetera.</li>
	<li><strong>PHP:</strong> Hypertext Preprocessor. What this strictly means, is that it can perform functions to change the HTML before the HTML is finalized and parsed by the browser. In practice, this means that that PHP can load data from a <strong>server</strong> and inject it into a webpage before it loads (like blog posts). Once a page has loaded, PHP has no use anymore.</li>
</ul>

<p>The order I put these in is not entirely random. In fact, I strongly recommend learning them in this particular order. If you know CSS, you can already create a lot of stunning websites. If you don't know CSS, learning JavaScript and PHP is quite useless if you are seriously considering creating a web project, and even difficult without that prior knowledge.</p>

<p>I hope to have inspired you. See you at the CSS course!</p>

  title: "The CSS3 Guide"
  post: "<p>CSS is the programming language for layout and design, and it stands for Cascading Style Sheets. <strong>Style sheets</strong> refer to the CSS files that tell a browser how to <em>style</em> certain elements, while <strong>cascading</strong> simply means that the browser chooses which rules to apply depending on their syntax and placement. (Don't worry, the concept of cascading is explained in detail in the <em>Priorities &amp; Inheritance</em> chapter.)</p> 

<p>You've probably just learned HTML, and are eager to know how you can make all those tags look good. Well, this is the guide for you! You can do virtually anything with CSS, and most of the functionality is supported in all major ('modern') browsers. In fact, you'll spend much more time playing with CSS than HTML when building a website.</p>

<p>You want some nice colours? CSS! You want animations when hovering over something? CSS! You want different fonts and typography? You get the idea. CSS is simple, clear, capable---there's really no reason <em>not</em> to learn it.</p>

<p>CSS3 is the latest version of this amazing language, and probably the last one. <em>Why?!</em> Because since this version, all functionality is created as <em>modules</em>. These modules can be adopted by browsers one at a time, and all fit nicely together, which means the language keeps growing and growing. Therefore, even though this is the third version of CSS, you should just look at it as being <em>the</em> only CSS there is. This guide will try to talk you through <em>everything</em> that is CSS. But, as that is a bit much, the focus lies on the basics and the most commonly used functionality. There's only one fundamental syntax, which means that most of the chapters just show you different ways to fill it in, instead of introducing completely different concepts. Have fun!</p>

  title: "[CSS3] Linking CSS & HTML"
  post: "<p>Without HTML elements, CSS can't do anything. Therefore, the first step is to link an HTML document with a set of CSS rules. Three ways for doing this are available to us: <strong>inline styles, style element</strong> and an external <strong>style sheet</strong>. I highly recommend the last one, but the first two also have their uses (and are quite common), so I will discuss all three options.</p> 

<h2>Inline Styles</h2>

<p>Inline styles are embedded within the HTML document itself. Every HTML element can take the <code>style</code> <strong>attribute</strong>, which takes CSS code as value.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<!-- Makes this element's text colour red -->
<p style="color:red">Some styled text!</p>
</pre>

<p>Therefore, anything you write there applies to this specific element only, and can't be easily copied or changed. Because of these major downsides, I recommend against this technique. It is, however, cleaner and faster in cases where you want to style a very specific element in an unique way (for example, a single letter in an article that you want a certain colour that you don't use anywhere else).</p>

<h2>Style Element</h2>

<p>The <code><style></code> tag can be put in the head section of an HTML document, and all its content will be parsed as CSS code. Basically, this allows you to use all the functionality that CSS provides in the same way as external style sheets would. But, it's still embedded within the HTML, which means that you'd have to copy the code between documents if you want them to have the same style.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<style type="text/css">
/* CSS Code Here */
</style>
</pre>

<p>Only use this when you really have no other choice, or it's a very small project with only one file.</p>

<h2>Style Sheet</h2>

<p>The last option is to put all the CSS code in an external file, which carries the extension <code>.css</code>. Then, use the <code><link></code> tag to link it to an HTML file. This link tag is also put in the head section, as style sheets are not part of the content but <em>describe</em> the page.</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="linktostylesheet.css">
</pre>

<p>The <code>rel</code> attribute defines what relation the linked file has with the HTML file. It is always necessary, because other file types could also be linked, and HTML wants to know.</p>

<p>Style sheets can be easily shared among multiple HTML files, can apply the same style to all sorts of groups of elements, and are usually <em>cached</em> by browsers (which means they are saved and don't need to be reloaded every time a user visits a webpage). As you can see, external style sheets are the way to go!</p>

<h2>Final Note</h2>

<p>In this course, all code examples can be viewed in the live html editor by hovering over them and clicking the button that appears. As this is a pure CSS tutorial, however, we focus on that, and you'll have to write some HTML tags yourself to test out the code. See it as an educational exercise!</p>

  id: 194
  title: "[CSS3] Syntax"
  post: "<p>Every bit of CSS starts with a <strong>selector</strong>, which is then followed by one or multiple <strong>declarations</strong>.</p>

<p>The role of the selector is to select a certain group of elements (for example, all <code><p></code> tags), while the declarations <em>declare</em> what style is assigned to those elements. Opening and closing braces are used to show when a certain group of declarations starts and ends.</p> 

<p><img src="media/CSS3SelectorsDeclarations.png" /></p>

<p>Selectors can be built from many small items with a certain functionality, which will all be discussed in the next chapter.</p>

<h2>Declarations</h2>

<p>Every declaration consists of two elements: <strong>property</strong> and <strong>value</strong>. The property and value are connected with a colon, and a semicolon is placed at the end to signal the end of the declaration.</p>

<p>The property determines <em>what</em> exactly of the element is being styled. For example, <em>font-size </em>alters the size of all text within the element.</p>

<p>The value determines <em>how</em> the property is being styled/altered. For example, you could set the font-size to <em>16px</em> (16 pixels).</p>

<img src="media/CSS3PropertiesValues.png" />

<h2>A Note on Inline Styles</h2>

<p>Because inline styles only work on the element they are set on, they don't require selectors. You only need to provide the declarations.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Just as with HTML, or any computer language really, CSS offers you the possibility to add comments within your code. These comments have no influence at all on the page - they are simply there to remind yourself about what certain parts do, or certain bugs you still need to fix.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
/* This is a comment
It can span multiple lines */
</pre>

<h2>That's It!</h2>

<p>This is all the syntax there is. The rest of this course, with the exception of the next chapter, is about all the different existing properties and the values they can take. All declarations can be applied to all elements, but some are specific to certain elements and don't affect others. Nevertheless, CSS will never throw errors if you do something wrong---it will just do the best it can with what you give it. Most of the times CSS provides an elegant solution to a problem, but sometimes you'll need to exploit some of the oddities or of the language---we like to call those things <em>CSS hacks</em>. Therefore, there are usually multiple ways to do something, and sometimes they require extra HTML elements and/or some advanced CSS magic. Don't be afraid to experiment!</p>

  title: "[CSS3] Selectors"
  post: "<p>There's a handful of different selectors available, that allow you to select any element(s) you wish---however specific or general. You can combine these in any way you like, and in any number. You could write a rule that selects all <code>p</code> (paragraph tags) that are direct children of <code>div</code>, or select every <code>input</code> with <code><attr>type</attr>="text"</code>, or even select a specific <code>span</code> tag ten levels deep in some HTML structure. The possibilities are endless!</p> 

<h2>Universal Selector</h2>

<p>Let's start off simple. The asterisk ( <code>*</code> ) selects <em>every element</em>. This is useful, for example, if you want to set a base font family for the entire page.</p>

<h2>Element Selector</h2>

<p>To select all tags of a certain kind, you simply use the tag name without the <code><</code> and <code>></code> around it.</p>

<p class="indented">For example: <code><p></code> becomes <code>p</code>, <code><h1></code> becomes <code>h1</code>

<pre data-lang="css">
/* Selects all paragraph elements */
p {
	color:red;
}

/* Selects all input elements */
input {
	font-size:24px;
}
</pre>

<h2>ID and Class Selector</h2>

<p>In the HTML tutorial, we've already seen the <strong>id</strong> and <strong>class</strong> attributes that are available to every element.</p>

<p>The idea is that every <em>id</em> is <strong>unique</strong>. Only one element can have a certain id.</p>

> To select the element with a certain id, use <code>#theIDName</code>

<p>If you want multiple elements to have the same styling rules applied, you use <em>class</em>. You can give as many elements as you want the same class name.</p>

> To select all elements in a certain class, use <code>.theClassName</code>

<pre data-lang="css">
/* Selects the element with ID panda */
#panda {
	color:red;
}

/* Selects all elements with class panda */
.panda {
	font-size:24px;
}
</pre>

<h2>Attribute Selector</h2>

<p>The last option is to select elements based on their attributes. Such a selector is enclosed within brackets, and can do two things:</p>

> Select everything that has a certain <em>attribute</em>: <code>[attribute]</code>

> Select everything that has a certain attribute set to a certain <em>value</em>: <code>[<attr>attribute</attr>=value]</code>

<pre data-lang="css">
/* Selects all elements with the src attribute set */
[src] {
	color:red;
}

/* Selects all elements with the src attribute set, with a value of panda.jpg */
[src="panda.jpg"] {
	font-size:24px;
}
</pre>

<h2>Element-Specific Selectors</h2>

<p>The last two categories can be combined with element selectors. To select a specific element with a certain ID, Class or Attribute, you simply put all the components right after each other. For example:</p>

> <code>a.coolLink</code> selects all anchor tags with a class <em>coolLink</em>

> <code>input[type="password"]</code> selects all password input tags.

<p>You are also allowed to use as many ID, Class and Attribute selectors after each other in this manner. The possibilities are endless! But, more than two of these after each other is very uncommon, because it's often just more complex than necessary.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
/*Selects the anchor element with ID coolLink, all span elements with class panda, and all text input fields */
a#coolLink, span.panda, input[type="text"] {
	color:red;
}
</pre>
<h2>Connecting the Dots</h2>

<p>Putting them directly next to each other doesn't work for everything, and most components need to be connected in another way. They can be separated by white space or a few predetermined special characters, and what you put between them largely determines how the selector functions. I've put together a nice table for you.

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Selector</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code><em>elem1</em>, <em>elem2</em></code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Starts a new selector (makes elem1 and elem2 two different selectors)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code><em>elem1 elem2</em></code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Selects all elem2 that are children of elem1, even if there are other tags between them</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code><em>elem1</em> > <em>elem2</em></code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Selects all elem2 that are <em>direct children</em> of elem1 (no other layers/tags between them)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code><em>elem1</em> + <em>elem2</em></code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Selects the first elem2 that is a sibling of elem1.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code><em>elem1</em> ~ <em>elem2</em></code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Selects <em>all</em> elem2 that are siblings of elem1</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>[<em>attr</em> ~= <em>val</em>]</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Selects all elements that have attr set, with a value <em>containing</em> val</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>[<em>attr</em> |= <em>value</em>]</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Selects all elements that have attr set, with a value <em>starting with</em> val</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>[<em>attr</em> ^= <em>value</em>]</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Selects all elements with attr set to a value <em>starting with </em>val</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>[<em>attr</em> $= <em>value</em>]</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Selects all elements with attr set to a value <em>ending in</em> val</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>[<em>attr</em> *= <em>value</em>]</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Selects all elements with attr set to a value <em>containing</em> val</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

<p>As you can see, the attribute selectors have some overlapping functionality. The difference is, that some attributes have a value that has white space or dashes in it. For example, you could set <code><attr>class</attr>="class1 class2 class3"</code> on a certain element. The <strong>~=</strong> and <strong>|=</strong> work for those cases, while the other two do not.</p>

  title: "[CSS3] Priorities & Inheritance"
  post: "<p>When two selectors target the same element(s), we speak of <em>conflicting styles</em>. So, with all those different possibilities and style rules, how does CSS decide what styles to use (in the end)?</p> 

<p>Well, there's two concepts that play a role here: <strong>inheritance </strong>(style rules that are automatically applied) and <strong>specificity </strong>(how specific the selector is).</p>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>

<p>All HTML elements come with a standard design---a CSS declaration for every known property. These are the same among all modern browsers, and most of those properties are set to the expected settings. For example, text alignment is automatically left for all elements. Setting a CSS property to the value <code>initial</code> will always reset it to what it automatically was.</p>

<p>On top of that, elements can inherit styles from <em>all</em> their parents. Some properties automatically do this, but you can always force it by setting a property to the value <code>inherit</code>. For example, if you make all the text inside a certain element red, you can easily extend these styles to all children nodes by using this value. Now, if you were to change the text colour of that element, all children would automatically follow along!</p>

<p>All properties can have those two values, which also means that they can cause unexpected 'bugs'. If something doesn't style the way it should, it's possible that it automatically inherits styles that overrule whatever you wrote.</p>

<h2>Specificity</h2>

<p>CSS selects <strong>the most specific selector</strong>, which depends on two things: placement and content.</p>

<h2>Placement</h2>

<p>Placement means that, if two selectors are equally specific, CSS chooses the <strong>last selector</strong> it finds, reading the style sheet from top to bottom.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	color:red;
}

p {
	color:blue;
}
/* All paragraphs will have text colour blue */
</pre>

<p>Inline styles are read even later by CSS, because they are embedded within the HTML, and <strong>always</strong> overrule everything. That's why you need to be careful with inline styles.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>

<p>There's actually a little formula you can calculate specificity with, using all elements within a selector. In this case, a higher score means it is more specific, and is more likely to be chosen by CSS as the final declarations. Each component in a selector is given a specificity score according to this table:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Component</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>In Code</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Score</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>ID Selector</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>#something</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>100</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Class selector</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>.something</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>10</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Anything else</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><code>something</code>, <code>[something="something"]</code>, &hellip;</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>1</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p> </p>

<p>The formula is: <em>add up the specificity score of all elements.</em></p>

> For example: <code>p div span</code> has score 3, while <code>#mainStuff span</code> has score 101. Therefore, span elements within the element with ID <code>#mainStuff</code> will be styled according to what belongs to the second selector.

<pre data-lang="css">
#mainContent p .firstSentence {
	font-family:Helvetica;
}

#mainContent p {
	font-family:Arial;
}

/* Paragraphs within the element with ID mainContent will have Arial as font, 
except for elements within paragraphs with class firstSentence */
</pre>

<h2>The important keyword</h2>

<p>There's one exception. You can boost the importance of a declaration by adding the magic words <code>!important</code> before the closing semicolon. This will tell CSS to ignore all those rules about specifics and inheritance, and just use this attribute.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	color:blue !important;
}

#mainContent p {
	color:red;
}
/* Paragraphs will have a blue text colour */
</pre>

<p>I am, however, against using this. A good CSS structure should prevent using this, and has better performance, readability and scalability. If you find yourself adding this keyword to something, there's no turning back---your style sheet will keep growing on important keywords, until it's all a big mess. If you find yourself eager to use it, try to think of a better way to structure your code to prevent it.</p>

  title: "[CSS3] Colours & Units"
  post: "<p>The majority of CSS properties take <strong>numbers</strong> or <strong>colours</strong> as values. A number by itself doesn't mean anything, which is why every number needs some <strong>unit</strong> after it. On the other hand, we can't describe a colour to a computer, which is why we need ways to input them. This chapter is about just that, and is the last one before we can finally begin discussing all the wonderful ways you can style things using CSS!</p> 

<h2>Units</h2>

<p>CSS has a bunch of predefined units you can use for your numbers. Those can be categorised as <strong>absolute units</strong> and <strong>relative units</strong>. These units are added directly behind the number---there's no white space between them (e.g., 100 pixels is denoted as <code>100px</code>).</p>

<p>NOTE: When a property has value 0, you don't need to supply a unit. Zero is always zero.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: As you will see later on, some properties take multiple arguments, and therefore multiple numbers. You can use different units for the different numbers if you want.</p>

<h2>Absolute Units</h2>

<p>This type of unit has a fixed length, and doesn't depend on the size or settings of the parent element or browser window an element is displayed in.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>

</table>

<p>NOTE: Viewing devices come in lots of different resolutions these days, which means a pixel doesn't always mean or look the same. Fortunately, however, most high resolution screens make up for it by treating one CSS pixel as multiple pixels on their device. You shouldn't run into many problems, but it has become more common these days to use relative units for everything.</p>

<h2>Relative Units</h2>

<p>This type of unit scales with the size of other elements or the browser window. Because devices can have a lot of different screen sizes, it's recommended to make as much as possible of your design <strong>responsive</strong>. This simply means that the layout easily adapts to changes in viewport size ( = dimensions of the browser window viewing the page).</p>

<h2>Colours</h2>

<p>CSS has around 175 colour names automatically supported, such as <em>red</em>, <em>orange</em> and <em>pink</em>. With a colour spectrum of over 16 million colours, however, that is a bit limiting. Therefore, other methods are used within CSS.</p>

<h5>RGB</h5>

<p><strong>RGB</strong> uses three channels as input: <strong>red</strong>, <strong>green</strong> and <strong>blue</strong>. Each of these can take a value between 0 and 255; 0 means the colour isn't present at all, and 255 means the colour is fully represented.</p>

> For example: <code>rgb(255,0,0)</code>is pure red, <code>rgb(0,0,255)</code> pure blue, <code>rgb(122,122,122)</code> is grey.

<p><strong>RGBA</strong> works the same way, but takes an extra <strong>alpha</strong> parameter that specifies the opacity of the colour. It doesn't actually change the colour, but determines to what extent underlying colours in the design influence it. An alpha of 0 means the colour is fully transparent (not visible), and an alpha of 1 means you can't see through it.</p>

<h5>HEX</h5>

<p><strong>HEX</strong> a different, shorter way of writing RGB colours. It uses a base-16 system. This simply means that we use the numbers 0---9, and then say A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, D = 13, E = 14 and F = 15. This way, we can represent those numbers (between 0 and 255) with only two digits: 00 up to and including FF.</p>

> For example: <code>#FF0000</code> is pure red, <code>#0000FF</code> is pure blue, <code>#7A7A7A</code> is grey

<p><strong>HEX shortcut</strong> is an even shorter way to display colours. If a colour has repeating digits, we can write a hex code with only one digit per channel.</p>

> For example:<code> #F00</code> is pure red, <code>#00F</code> is pure blue, <code>#FFF</code> is the whitest white.

<h5>HSL</h5>

<p><strong>HSL</strong> is an entirely different way of representing colours. It uses <strong>hue</strong>, <strong>saturation</strong> and <strong>luminosity</strong> as arguments. These translate to <em>colour, pureness </em>and <em>brightness</em>. Hue gets a value between 0 and 360 degrees, saturation and luminosity from 0 to 100%.</p>

> For example: <code>hsl(0,100,50)</code> is full red, <code>hsl(240,100,50)</code> pure blue, <code>hsl(0,0,50)</code> is grey.

<p><strong>HSLA</strong> works the same way, but takes an extra alpha parameter (just as RGBA).</p>

<p>This might be much to take in now, but I assure you that you'll get the hang of it quickly once you start playing around with it. I prefer working with HSL, but it takes some getting used to, and if I know what colour I want it's usually quicker to write them with <em>hex</em> or <em>rgb</em>. Colours with an alpha component are a bit heavier for the browser, but these days that shouldn't be a problem for most systems.</p>

<p>Usually though, people create a colour palette before they start designing, and I recommend doing that. There are lots of tools out there that let you pick colours that look good together, and they often immediately provide the CSS colour codes with it, so colours shouldn't be much of an issue!</p>"

  title: "[CSS3] The Box Model"
  post: "<p>As far as CSS is concerned, all HTML elements are little boxes. Boxes with certain dimensions and position, with a border and some empty space.</p> 

<p>Whatever the shape of its children or parent elements, everything is a box. This may seem as if it restricts your options (what if you wanted a circular element?), but it actually enables you to create a vast array of different designs in an easy way. Rectangles are simple and intuitive geometry, especially for <em>rectangular</em> browser windows, which means it isn't hard to find out what effect a certain CSS declaration will have.</p>

<h2>A Very Important Image</h2>

<p><img src="media/CSS3BoxModel.png" /></p>

<p>Remember this image very well. It is a very simple overview of what lies at the core of CSS. Every box can be styled with these properties to be at any position, at any size. Using padding you can even position and scale the content that is inside, while the border provides a way to distinguish different elements on the page.</p>

<p>Whenever you create a new design for anything on your website, I think it is useful to always start with the box model. First look at those basic properties and see what you can get by only setting those, and only then look further to more advanced properties to achieve the exact look you want.</p>

<p>For example, say you wanted to offset a certain element X, 100 pixels to the right. You could place an element before X in the HTML structure, and make that element a hundred pixels wide. But, the easier way would be to make the left margin of X one hundred pixels exactly.</p>

<h2>Seriously, everything's a box</h2>

<p>Even the body element that is required for every HTML page. Most browsers automatically add some padding to this element to offset all content from the sides of the browser window---much like there's always some white space around the borders when you print something on A4. Keep this in mind, and know that you could just select the body element with CSS to override those standard rules.</p>

  title: "[CSS3] Margin, Padding & Dimensions"
  post: "<p>By default, every element scales to fit all the content that is inside. This means that if you type a really long sentence, the element would become wider than the screen and you would have to scroll to read it all. This also means that if you type something really short, you get a nice clean box around it with perfect dimensions. Webpages, however, are not made to extend in width but in height. We read from top to bottom, so it's only logical that you have to scroll down to read further on large webpages. Therefore, if you set or restrict the width of an element, text that reaches the end of the line will automatically continue on the next line below---like we're used to. Nice!</p> 

<h2>Setting width and height</h2>

<p>As expected, we use the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties for this. These can take any number as value.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
.someBox {
	width:500px;
	height:100%;
}
</pre>

<h2>Restricting width and height</h2>

<p>If we want our webpage to be responsive, i.e. scale with different viewport sizes, a fixed size for each element isn't going to help us. It's therefore common practice to set the size of an element in percentages, and then restrict it to make sure it doesn't get too small or large.</p>

<p>The <code>max-width</code> and <code>max-height</code> properties set a maximum, while <code>min-width</code> and <code>min-height</code> properties set the minimum. Again, you can provide a number as value.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
.someBox {
	max-width:100%;
	max-height:100%;
	min-width:500px;
	min-height:500px;
}
/* Box scales with the page and content, but stays within 500px - 100% bounds*/
</pre>

<h2>Padding</h2>

<p>Padding refers to the white space between the content of a box and its border. There are four sides for which we can set this: left, top, right, bottom.</p>

<p>To set a value for these individually, we use <code>padding-left</code>, <code>padding-top</code>, <code>padding-right</code>, and <code>padding-bottom</code> after each other.</p>

<p>But, we can also take a shortcut. The <code>padding</code> property can take one to four arguments:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Declaration</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Explanation</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>padding: <em>a b c d</em>;</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Sets top, right, bottom and left side to a, b, c, d respectively</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>padding: <em>a b c</em>;</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Sets top to a, right and left to b, and bottom to c</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>padding: <em>a b</em>;</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Sets top and bottom to a, right and left to b</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>padding: <em>a</em>;</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Sets all sides to a</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p> </p>

<p>It's okay though not to use these shortcuts until you are comfortable with setting them individually.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
.someBox {
	padding:20px;
}
/* Content of the box has 20px white space all around it */
</pre>

<h2>Margin</h2>

<p>Margin refers to the white space between the border of a box and the outside world ("the other boxes").</p>

<p>Again, we can set the same four sides with <code>margin-left</code>, <code>margin-top</code>, <code>margin-right</code>, and <code>margin-bottom</code>.</p>

<p>There's also the <code>margin</code> shortcut that can take one to four arguments in exactly the same way as padding. Margin and padding are practically the same concept, it's just that one is on the inside of the box, and the order at the outside.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
.someBox {
	margin:20px;
}
/* The whole box has 20px white space all around it */
</pre>

<h2>Box Sizing</h2>

<p>Now, there's one small obstacle. When we set a width or height for an element, it does <strong>not</strong> take into account the padding, border and margin. For example, if we set an element to a width of 100 pixels, and then add a padding of 10 pixels, the resulting element on screen will take up 110 pixels.</p>

<p>If we want the browser to take padding and border into account, we need to set the <code>box-sizing</code> property. The default value is <code>content-box</code>, but we want it to be <code>border-box</code>.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
.someBox {
	box-sizing:border-box;
}
</pre>

<p><em>Why doesn't it take margin into account?</em> Because margin isn't important for an element's size---it's mainly for positioning purposes (to offset it or give it some breathing space). Other elements can sit within the margin, and you won't notice because they can't collide with the content within the box.</p>"

  title: "[CSS3] Borders"
  post: "<p>Borders are more important than you think. When most people think about borders, especially on the web, they paint a picture of an ugly, grey, thin line around something. Yes, those are the default borders that come with some elements, but those are <em>bad borders</em>. In web design, borders are used very often to subtly make a distinction between different groups or content. The other option you have with borders is to go big or go home---for example, this website uses a huge border to the left of every article to separate content and navigation, and that border forms a significant part of the overall design.</p> 

<p>Every element can have a border around it, at all four sides. These can be as large as you want to be, take on certain styles (solid or dots for example), and use colours or images to fill them in. If you find the corners too sharp, you can make them round. As you can see, somehow, a lot of attention was paid to borders when CSS was created.</p>

<h2>The Syntax</h2>

<p>First, we'll focus on the syntax for giving one side of an element a border. As expected, the properties for these are <code>border-left</code>, <code>border-top</code>, <code>border-right</code>, and <code>border-bottom</code>. It needs three arguments, which are <strong>width, style</strong> and <strong>colour</strong>, respectively.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The width determines the size of the border, and takes any <em>positive</em> number.</li>
	<li>The style <strong>must</strong> be set to something, or the border won't display. The list of border styles can be found at the end of this chapter.</li>
	<li>The colour speaks for itself---it can use any valid CSS colour code.</li>
</ul>

<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	border-bottom:1px solid green;
	border-left:3px solid black;
	border-right:8px dotted red;
	border-top:2px solid purple;
}
</pre>

<p>If you want to alter one of those three arguments individually, you can do that as well! Simply add <code>-width</code>, <code>-style</code> or <code>-color</code> to the end.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	border-left-width:1px;
	border-left-style:solid;
	border-left-color:green;
}
</pre>

<h2>The Shortcut Syntax</h2>

<p>Luckily, the syntax for setting multiple borders in one declaration is the same as we've seen with padding and margin, and uses the <code>border</code> property. The only difference here is that every value is actually three values.</p>


<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	border:1px solid green;
}

p {
	border-bottom:1px solid green;
	border-left:1px solid green;
	border-right:1px solid green;
	border-top:1px solid green;
}

/* These two styles are identical */
</pre>

<p>But, because of that multitude of arguments, you can also set one of them for multiple borders at the same time, using the <code>border-width</code>, <code>border-style</code> and <code>border-color</code> properties.</p>

<h2>Round Borders</h2>

<p>With round borders, I mean the roundness of the corners. If you set it to some high value, the box will look like an ellipse or circle---but it's still a box.</p>

<p>You can create them by setting the <code>border-radius</code> property. By default, a border has a sharp edge and therefore border radius 0.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	border-radius:50%;
}
</pre>

<h2>Outlines</h2>

<p>Sometimes, we need more than one border. To be able to do so, we can essentially fill some of the element's margin, creating a border around the border. We can only do this once though: if you want a massive amount of borders, just create multiple nested elements. This is done with the <code>outline</code> property, which accepts the same arguments.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	outline:5px solid green;
}
</pre>

<p>The outline is in the margin, so it doesn't add to the element's width or height.</p>

<h2>Image Borders</h2>

<p>Using an image as a border is a tricky business. It allows you to create all sorts of fancy borders you couldn't possibly get with the normal syntax, but it takes some preparation. The property to use is <code>border-image</code>.</p>

<p>First of all, the border-image won't work if you don't set a border width, so don't forget that. The reason for this is that the image scales with the border width, so the default width of 0px leaves you with no image.</p>

<p>It takes three arguments: an <strong>image</strong>, how to <strong>slice</strong> the image, and how to <strong>apply</strong> the image.</p>

<p>The image is provided by URL, which means <code><attr>url(</attr>'pathtofile.jpg'<attr>)</attr></code>. CSS can handle pretty much any file type, but <em>jpg</em>, <em>png</em> and <em>gif</em> are favourites.</p>

<p><img src="media/CSS3BorderImage.png" /></p>

<p>Slicing the image is done by defining what part of the image is border, and what is not. It works the same way as the normal shortcut syntax for border width, and works from the outside to the inside. See the image for clarification---I can't really explain this in words.</p>

<p>There are three options for how to apply the image:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>repeat</code>: repeats the image along the borders</li>
	<li><code>stretch</code>: stretches the image to create the borders</li>
	<li><code>round</code>: repeats, and then stretches if it doesn't fit perfectly.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's most common to set one value for all borders, but you can set them individually as well if you like.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	border-image: url(aFile.jpg) 10% repeat;
}
</pre>

  title: "[CSS3] Display"
  post: "<p>Until now, we've viewed everything as a strong and independent box with lots of space around it. But that's not how most elements behave. Websites often have a few big containers (such as header, footer, sidebar, content), and the rest of the elements is displayed in a different way.</p> 

<p>In the HTML5 tutorial, we made a distinction between <strong>block</strong> and <strong>inline</strong> elements when we talked about <code><div></code> and <code><span></code>, and this is the part where CSS continues on the subject. Arguably, it's the most important property there is, because CSS is all about displaying stuff. Not surprisingly, the property to use is <code>display</code>.</p>

<p>A <code>block</code>-level element has a fixed size, regardless of the content. It doesn't allow other elements next to it, and pushes those below itself. A block-level element is useful, because it is clean and consistent in behaviour, but it's hard to work with them once you get to the details of a design.</p>

<p>That's when <code>inline</code> elements come into play. Inline elements <em>can't</em> have their width and height set---those are determined by their content and surroundings. Their placement is also determined by what's around it, as they will try to be <em>in line</em> with the text or other elements.</p>

<p>While those two cover most cases, there will be times when you want a block element next to other elements instead of in its own space, and there's a compromise for that: <code>inline-block</code>.</p>

<img src="media/CSS3DisplayProperty.png" />

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	display:block;
}

span {
	display:inline;
}

.specialElements {
	display:inline-block;
}
</pre>

<p>NOTE: Setting the property to <code>none</code> means the element has no effect on the layout. It doesn't remove it from the page.</p>

<h2>Tables</h2>

<p>In the HTML5 tutorial, I kept telling you to keep mark up and layout separate. To make this easier, CSS has a way of simulating a tabular layout, without actually using <code><table></code> tags. This tabular layout is created by setting the display property of a group of elements to certain values.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Value</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>table</code></p>

			</td>

</table>

<p>The last five are actually not that useful, as those exist in HTML5 mostly for structure and not design or layout. But the first ones can make it very easy to create a responsive design, though they can be tricky.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	display:table;
}

div > div {
	display:table-row;
}

div > div > div {
	display:table-cell;
}
</pre>

<h2>Extras</h2>

<p>You can also use the value <code>list-item</code> to make an element look like a list item, which means it has a bullet in front and is slightly indented.</p>

<p>The value <code>run-in</code> is equal to block or inline, depending on what fits best in the context. It's decided by the browser, which means it isn't very consistent, and I recommend not using it.</p>

<h2>Flexbox</h2>

<p>The last two values it can obtain are <code>flex</code> and <code>inline-flex</code>. Those signal the start of a flexbox environment, which is a very useful but much larger topic than is necessary to discuss now. It will be elaborated on in the <em>Flexbox</em> chapter, much later in this course!</p>

<h2>Overflow</h2>

<p>The last thing to worry about now, is what to do if the content is bigger than its parent. When the content <em>overflows</em> the container's dimensions, you can use the <code>overflow</code> property to control it. The default value is <code>visible</code>, which means nothing is done about it.</p>

<p>To hide everything outside of the box, use <code>hidden</code>. To make the element scrollable, use <code>scroll</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to specify different instructions for the width (x-direction) and height (y-direction), use <code>overflow-x</code> and <code>overflow-y</code>.</p>

div {
	width:300px;

  title: "[CSS3] Positioning"
  post: "<p>We've already seen how to, to some extent, position elements using their display and margins. But what if we want a header fixed to the top? Or move an element on hover? That's when the <code>position</code> attribute comes in handy. There's four values it can take on, and they are all very important. Once you have set the type of positioning you want, you can use the <code>left</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>right</code> and <code>bottom</code> properties to specify the offset at each side.</p> 

<h2>Static</h2>

<p>The default positioning. Nothing special is done, and the element is not affected by the positional properties (left, top, right and bottom). If you want something to be positioned the regular way---which is often the case---you don't have to set this; you can just omit the position property.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	position:static;
}
</pre>

<h2>Relative</h2>

<p>The element is positioned relative to its original, normal position. This means that it leaves a gap of white space at the place it originally was, one that is not filled by other elements. This might seem unwanted, but it would quickly become a mess if every element would try to slip into other element's spots.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p span {
	position:relative;
}
</pre>

<h2>Absolute</h2>

<p>An absolutely positioned element solves the gap problem. Its dimensions are completely removed from the page, and the element can be placed anywhere. The positional properties determine the offset from the <em>nearest positioned ancestor</em>. This simply means that it looks at the parent elements, and checks if they have their position set to anything else than static. If that is not the case, the element is positioned with respect to the document body, and moves along with page scrolling</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
span.absolutePos {
	position:absolute;
}
</pre>

<p>It's often used for pinning an element to the bottom or top of its parent container, in which case you shouldn't forget to also give that parent element a positional value.</p>

<h2>Fixed</h2>

<p>A fixed element is always positioned relatively to the viewport ( = browser window), which means that it always keeps the same position, even when the user scrolls. Just as an absolutely positioned element, it doesn't leave a gap.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
#fixedHeader {
	position:fixed;
}
</pre>

<h2>Overlapping Elements</h2>

<p>With fancy new positions comes responsibility. Elements can start to overlap and get in the way, and you need to decide which one is displayed on top. This is done with the <code>z-index</code> property, which takes any number as a value. CSS automatically assigns these numbers to the elements, increasing it towards the end of the style sheet. But you can override it any time you want.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
#frontPopup {
	z-index:10000;
}

  title: "[CSS3] Alignment"
  post: "<p>We all know about text alignment, but in CSS there are ways to transfer this concept to whole elements. Sometimes you don't want to pin an element's position as precisely as in the previous chapter, and that's when you use alignment.</p> 

<h2>Float and Clear</h2>

<p>The <code>float</code> property was originally intended to wrap text around images, but it has a lot of uses. It tells CSS that an element should be taken out of the normal flow, and pinned against the <code>left</code> or <code>right</code> edge.</p>

<p><em>What's the difference with absolute positioning?</em> The element is still taken into account, and elements around it will work with it nicely, instead of overlapping or 'colliding'.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
img {
	float:left;
}
/* Aligns images to the left and makes text naturally flow around it */
</pre>

<p>There are, however, moments when you don't want elements to push themselves against a floating element. You can use the <code>clear</code> property to specify on which side of an element you don't allow floating elements. The values it can take are <code>left</code>, <code>right</code> and <code>both</code>.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	clear:both;
}
/* Paragraphs are not allowed to have any elements floating beside it */
</pre>

<h2>Vertical-align</h2>

<p>Vertical align is very useful, but not the hero you want it to be. Your first thought would be that you can align any element to the top, bottom or centre---but that's not true. The reason for this is that webpages were designed to extend towards the bottom, and vertically aligning something would therefore often mean that it is placed miles away from where it originally was, which creates problems for the text around it. Therefore, the property <code>vertical-align</code> only works in contained environments: tables and inline-block elements.</p>

<p>Tables, by default, align the cell contents to the middle of the cell. Most of the time, though, you want it to align contents to the top, and then you can use this property. It also works on elements that have their display property set to <code>table-cell</code>.</p>

<p>Inline-block elements, by default, are aligned to the baseline. This means that it finds that imaginary line that typed text always sits on, and aligns that with the baseline of the text around it. But, sometimes you don't want that, and then you can change it with this property as well.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p span {
	vertical-align:top;
	display:inline-block;
}
/* All span elements within paragraphs are pinned to the top */
</pre>

<p>The possible values are:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Value</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>top</code></p>

			<td>
			<p>The element is centred vertically within the parent element</p>

			<td>
			<p>The bottom of the element is aligned with the lowest element in the line</p>

  title: "[CSS3] Text"
  post: "<p>Now that you know how to create your overall layout with those nifty boxes, the second biggest thing is the <strong>typography</strong>. If you don't define any properties for your text, it will still display fine, but probably not look very well.</p> 

<p>The default settings are a <em>black</em> colour, <em>Times New Roman</em> font, and no special other settings (like, for example, white space between letters). Now, I don't know about you, but that looks awful in almost any web design. Thankfully, CSS has a lot of typographic properties you can and should use to your advantage.</p>

<p>(I have a <strong><em>typography course</em></strong> for anybody interested in the details!)</p>

<h2>Color</h2>

<p>To set the text colour, we use the <code>color</code> property. It can take any valid CSS colour code as its value.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	color:rgb(100,150,250);
}
</pre>

<h2>Text Alignment</h2>

<p>The <code>text-align</code> property handles this, and can take the four values <code>left</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>right</code> and <code>justified</code>.</p>

<p><em>What is justified?</em> Justified means that the browser stretches a line of text, by adding extra spacing between words, to fit the width exactly. The left and right margins are straight, which is often perceived as cleaner, but be careful that not too much uneven spacing is added between words.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
h1 {
	text-align:center;
	width:100%;
}
</pre>

<h2>Spacing</h2>

<p>Use <code>letter-spacing</code> to increase white space between letters, and <code>word-spacing</code> to increase white space between words. They both take any number (even negative ones) as value.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	letter-spacing:2px;
	word-spacing:10px;
}
</pre>

<h2>Line Height</h2>

<p>The <code>line-height</code> property specifies white space between <em>lines of text</em>. The default value of 100% is often too low for web design. Again, can use any number!</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	line-height:145%;
}
</pre>

<h2>Transformation</h2>

<p>The <code>text-transform</code> property can transform a piece of text to a different case: <code>lowercase</code>, <code>uppercase</code> or <code>capitalize</code>. The first two do what you expect, which is turn all letters to lowercase or uppercase. Capitalize means that it makes the first letter of every word a capital letter.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
h1 {
	text-transform:uppercase;
}
</pre>

<h2>Decoration</h2>

<p>The <code>text-decoration</code> property is used to <code>underline</code> (like with links), <code>overline</code> or <code>line-through</code> (like the <del> tag) elements. Setting it to <code>none</code> removes it.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
a {
	text-decoration:none;
}
</pre>

<p>NOTE: Underlined elements are often assumed to be links, which is why I suggest leaving the text-decoration for the links. If you desperately want a line above or below something, try a <em>border</em>.</p>

<h2>Indentation</h2>

<p>There are two ways to create a distinction between paragraphs: some vertical white space between them, or indenting the first line. Never both. The <code>text-indent</code> basically represents a margin only for the first line of text in an element, and can take any number as value.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	text-indent:36.0pt;
}
</pre>

<h2>Wrapping</h2>

<p>The default behaviour is to start a new line when the text content becomes wider than the element, and the browser breaks off the current line at a white space or hyphen.</p>

<p>Sometimes though, you'll have words that are just too long, and if you only started newlines at whitespace characters the text would look very odd. The <code>word-wrap</code> property can prevent this. The default value is <code>normal</code>, but you can set it to <code>break-word</code> if you want to allow browsers to cut long words in half.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p {
	word-wrap:break-word;
}
</pre>

<p>You can even take it one step further, and let the browser break all words at any point they need. For this, the <code>word-break</code> property was invented. The default value is <code>keep-all</code>, but setting it to <code>break-all</code> tells browsers they can split words at any point. I don't recommend using it.</p>

<p>And lastly, if you have set the overflow property to hidden on a certain element, it's useful to tell the user that some part has been cut off. You can do this with the <code>text-overflow</code> property. The default value is <code>clip</code> (just hide the overflow), but <code>ellipsis</code> adds an ellipsis ( &hellip; ) at the end.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p span {
	text-overflow:ellipsis;
}
</pre>

<h2>White Space</h2>

<p>One of the main concepts of HTML is that it removes all white space and line breaks typed in the code, and replaces them with a single space between characters. The only exception is the <strong><pre></strong> element, but that has a semantic value (and some extra default styles), so you don't want to use that for everything. Therefore, to simulate some of its good attributes, the <code>white-space</code> property has been created. It controls how white space inside an element is used.</p>

<img src="media/CSS3WhiteSpace.png" />

<p>The default setting is <code>normal</code>, which means it collapses sequences of whitespace into a single one and wraps text automatically when necessary (as discussed in the previous section on wrapping). The other values are:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Value</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>nowrap</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Sequences of white space will collapse. Text will never wrap automatically---it will continue on the same line until it encounters a <br/> tag</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>pre</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>All whitespace is preserved by the browser. Text will only wrap on line breaks</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>pre-line</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Sequences of white space will collapse, but line breaks are preserved and text will also wrap when necessary.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>pre-wrap</code></p>

			<p>All whitespace is preserved, but text will wrap on line breaks and when necessary</p>

  post: "<p>Now it is time to get rid of that default font, and add some variation.</p> 

<h2>Font Families</h2>

<p>To set the font for a certain element, use the <code>font-family</code> property.</p>

<p><em>Why the "family"?</em> Because most fonts have light, bold, italic, and other variations that all belong to the same family. This way, you can set a font family for an element, and then use other properties to access the different styles within that family.</p>

<p>The value is the name of the font. You can use pre-installed fonts that come with every system (like Arial or Helvetica), or you can add your own fonts. That is discussed at the end of this chapter.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
body {
	font-family: 'Open Sans';
}
</pre>

<p>If you want, you can specify multiple values, separated by commas. If a certain font isn't available or failed to load properly, the browser will check with the next one, until it finds a font it can use. It's a sort of backup plan.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
body {
	font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman;
}
</pre>

<h2>Font Size</h2>

<p>The <code>font-size</code> property can be used for that. It can take any <em>positive</em> number as value.</p>

<p>The default font size is 16px, and it's recommended to keep font sizes on the web larger than in print. The actual size partially depends on the font---some fonts are naturally larger or smaller.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
body {
	font-size: 20px;
}
</pre>

<h2>Style and Weight</h2>

<p>The <code>font-style</code> property is used to create <em>italics</em>. It has three values: <code>normal</code>, <code>italic</code> and <code>oblique</code>. The last two both display a slanted version of the font, but italic tries to use the italic variation of a font family, while oblique simply puts every letter at an angle. It's therefore recommended to use the italic value whenever possible.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p span {
	font-style:italic;
}
</pre>

<p>The other style a font can have, light or bold, is set with the <code>font-weight</code> property. The most common values are <code>normal</code> and <code>bold</code>, and can be used with any font</p>

<p>However, it also accepts the numbers <em>100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800</em> and <em>900</em>. Here, 100 is a very thin variation and 900 an extremely thick one. These values only have effect if the specified font-family has their own font file for these. For example, every computer has the font-family Calibri, which contains a file called Calibri Light.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p .highlight {
	font-weight: bold;
}
</pre>

<p>Similarly, the <code>font-stretch</code> property defines how much the letters are stretched, but can only be used if the font-family has support for it. The possible values are: <em>ultra-condensed, extra-condensed, semi-condensed, condensed, normal, expanded, semi-expanded, extra-expanded </em>and <em>ultra-expanded</em>.</p>

<h2>Variation</h2>

<p>The <code>font-variant</code> property is a very specific one. It only accepts two values: <code>normal</code> and <code>small-caps</code>. Small-caps are basically uppercase letters, but made smaller so that they are the same size as the lowercase ones.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
a {
	font-variant:small-caps;
}
</pre>

<h2>Adding Custom Fonts</h2>

<p>To add our own custom fonts, we use a special type of selector: <code>@font-face</code>. Within, we need to specify at least two things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <code>font-family</code> property with the name we want to give the font as value.</li>
	<li>The <code>src</code> property with the URL to the font file as value.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to add variations, like condensed or italic, you need to specify those as well.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
@font-face {
	font-family: AwesomeName;
	src: url(FontFile.otf);
}
</pre>

<p>All browsers support the TTF, OTF and WOFF formats, and loading of fonts is usually quite quick. Just to be sure, however, make sure your font files are not too large.</p>

<p>NOTE: The @font-face selector only applies to one font. If you want to add multiple custom fonts, you need to close the selector and start a new selector for the next one.</p>

  title: "[CSS3] Backgrounds & Images"
  post: "<p>The one major thing we haven't discussed yet, is the background. Every element can have a background, and it often adds a lot to your design if you play with it.</p> 

<h2>Background Colour</h2>

<p>You can set the complete background to a single colour using the <code>background-color</code> property, which takes any valid CSS colour code as value.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
body {
	background-color:rgb(200,100,50);
}
</pre>

<p>One flat colour, however, isn't always interesting. Sometimes you want some more variation, and that's when <strong>images</strong> and <strong>gradients</strong> come in. I'll now discuss images---gradients are less important and saved for a later chapter.</p>

<h2>Background Images</h2>

<p>By default, setting a background image will pin the image to the top left corner. It will include it in its full size, and repeat along the width and height if necessary. But, that's not always what you want---it's almost never what you want, actually---which means there's a lot of properties for background images to get them looking great.</p>

<p>The <code>background-image</code> property sets the image, and takes a URL as value.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
.coolIcon {
	background-image:url(coolImage.jpg);
}
</pre>

<h2>Background Repeat</h2>

<p>To control the repeating you can use the <code>background-repeat</code> property, which has the values:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>repeat</code> (repeat the image in both x and y direction)</li>
	<li><code>repeat-x</code> (repeat the image in the x direction = horizontally)</li>
	<li><code>repeat-y</code> (repeat the image in the y direction = vertically)</li>
	<li><code>no-repeat</code> (if you don't want it to repeat)</li>
</ul>

<pre data-lang="css">
body {
	background-image:url(seamlessTexture.jpg);
	background-repeat:repeat;
}
</pre>

<h2>Background Position</h2>

<p>To reposition it, use the <code>background-position</code> property. You can supply two numbers, which are the offset in the x and y direction, respectively. Some predefined values, though, are available and are often just wat you need:</p>

> <em>left top, left center, left bottom, right top, right center, right bottom, center top, center center </em>and <em>center bottom</em>.

<p>If you specify only one keyword, the other one will automatically be <em>center</em>.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
.coolIcon {
	background-position: center;
	/* background-position: center center; would be the same */
}
</pre>

<h2>Background Attachment</h2>

<p>The <code>background-attachment</code> property specifies what part of an element the background is attached to, which in turn decides what happens when the user scrolls. The default value is <code>scroll</code>, which means the background scrolls along with the element it belongs to; it is fixed to its position within the element. Other possible values are:</p>

> <code>fixed</code>: the background is fixed to the viewport, and scrolls when the viewport scrolls, regardless of the element's position or scroll.

> <code>local</code>: the background scrolls along with the element's contents, like it would do if it was an image inside the element.

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	background-attachment: local;
}
</pre>

<h2>Background Size</h2>

<p>Use the <code>background-size</code> property. You can specify exact dimensions using two numbers (width and height), but there's also two predefined values that can be useful:</p>

> <code>contain</code>: scales it to fit to the smallest dimension. This means that the background image will never overflow the element and fit perfectly at one side, but there might be a gap because it's too small.

> <code>cover</code>: scales it to fit to the largest dimension. This means that the background image will nicely fill the whole element, but it will overflow at the smaller side.

<p>To some extent, overflow and fitting problems can be fixed by making your image the correct aspect ratio.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
.coolIcon {
	background-size:contain;
}
body {
	background-size:50% 50%;
}
</pre>

<h2>Background Clip</h2>

<p>The <code>background-clip</code> property tells us how far to extend the background. More specifically, it determines whether the background also covers the border or padding area of a box. It has, therefore, 3 possible values:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>border-box</code>: the default value. The background extends to the borders, and will therefore be visible underneath semi-transparent borders.</li>
	<li><code>padding-box</code>: the background doesn't cover the borders, but does extend through padding space.</li>
	<li><code>content-box</code>: the background only covers the actual content---padding is left as white space.</li>
</ul>
<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	background-clip:content-box;
}
</pre>

<h2>Background Origin</h2>

<p>The <code>background-origin</code> property works the same way as <code>background-clip</code>, but with a small difference. A background clip determines what part of the background is shown, while the background origin determines where that background image is positioned. Essentially, it determines from where the <code>background-position</code> property starts to offset the image. It takes the same 3 values as <code>background-clip</code>.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	background-origin: border-box;
}
</pre>

<p>NOTE: <code>background-origin</code> and <code>background-clip</code> also work for regular background <em>colours</em>!</p>

<h2>Opacity</h2>

<p>We've already seen how to make semi-transparent colours, but we can also set how transparent a <em>complete element</em> is---including borders, background, and all content. For this we use the <code>opacity</code> property, which takes a number between 0 and 1; 0 means it's fully transparent (invisible), 1 means it's fully opaque (the default setting, you don't see what's underneath it).</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
img {
	opacity:0.5;
}
</pre>

<h2>Multiple Background Images</h2>

<p>You can specify as many background images as you like, using a comma to separate them.</p>

<p>All the other properties can also accept as many values as you like, separated by comma.</p>

<p>As you'd expect, these are linked by order---the first value corresponds to the first URL specified, second to the second, etcetera.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
.superCoolIcon {
	background-image: url(image1.jpg), url(image2.jpg), url(image3.jpg);
	background-position: left top, center, right bottom;
}

  title: "[CSS3] Lists, Tables & Links"
  post: "<p>Up until now I've discussed with you all the fundamental properties of CSS, and to close off this portion of the course I'll discuss a few properties aimed specifically at a certain group of elements. This doesn't mean that everything past this chapter isn't important anymore---this simply means that the advanced stuff is coming.</p> 

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>The <code>resize</code> property can be used to specify if an element can be resized. Though this property is available for every element, its most common use is to allow the user to resize input elements that are too small or large.</p>

<p>The values it can take are <code>horizontal</code> (you can adjust the width), <code>vertical</code> (you can adjust the height) or <code>both</code>. The default value is <code>none</code>, which means it can't be resized.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
input[type="text"] {
	resize:both;
}
</pre>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>By default, for HTML lists, browsers use bullets for unordered lists and numbers for ordered ones. We can change this!</p>

<p>The <code>list-style-type</code> property takes care of this. It can have these values:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Value</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>disc</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The default value</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>none</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Nothing in front of it</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>circle</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The marker is a circle</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>square</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The marker is a square</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>decimal</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The marker is a number</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>decimal-leading-zero</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The marker is a number with leading zeros (01, 02, &hellip; )</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>lower-alpha</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Lowercase letters: a, b, c, d, &hellip;</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>lower-latin</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Same as lower-alpha.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>lower-greek</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Lowercase Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>lower-roman</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Lowercase Roman numbers: i, ii, iii, iv, &hellip;</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>upper-alpha</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Uppercase letters: A, B, C, D, &hellip;</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>upper-latin</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Same as upper-alpha</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>upper-roman</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Uppercase Roman numbers: I, II, III, IV, &hellip;</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>But, if you want something really special, you can use <code>list-style-image</code> with a URL to an image.</p>

<p>And, last but not least, using the <code>list-style-position</code> property, we can decide if we want this marker <code>inside</code> or <code>outside</code> the <li> tag.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
ul {
	list-style-type: upper-roman;
	list-style-position: outside;
}
</pre>

<h2>Tables</h2>

<p>The <code>border-collapse</code> property determines whether two borders of adjacent cells should be merged. The default value is <code>separate</code>, in which case borders are kept detached, which results in the standard so-called double border. The other value is <code>collapse</code>, in which case they are merged.</p>

<p>The <code>border-spacing</code> property determines the distance ("margin") between two adjacent cells, and can take any number as value. If you give it two values, the first one sets <em>horizontal</em> spacing, and the second one <em>vertical</em> spacing.</p>

<p>The <code>empty-cells</code> property determines whether or not empty cells should be shown. The default value is <code>show</code>. The other value is <code>hide</code>, in which case no background or borders are shown for empty cells.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you set border-collapse to <em>collapse</em>, cells are merged and empty cells removed, which means the <em>border-spacing</em> and <em>empty-cells</em> properties have no influence anymore.</p>

<p>The <code>caption-side</code> property determines where to display a table's caption (because the <caption> element always needs to follow the <table> element directly, you can't easily put it somewhere else another way). The default is <code>top</code>, the other value is <code>bottom</code>---which means the caption is put below the table.</p>

<p>And finally, the <code>table-layout</code> property determines the algorithm used for displaying the table. The default value is <code>auto</code>, in which case column width is determined after the whole table has loaded, and adapts to the contents. The other value is <code>fixed</code>, which means the table follows width restrictions that you set, and can process the table faster.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
table {
	border-collapse:separate;
	border-spacing:20px;
	empty-cells:hide;
}
</pre>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>Have you ever noticed your cursor changing when hovering over a link? Well, for a lot of people, that is the cue that something is clickable or interactive. Therefore, it's possible in CSS to change the cursor for elements that are not links, but supposed to be clickable. It can be used for any element, but to signal a (sort of) link is by far the most common use. We use the <code>cursor</code> property for this, and it has the most amount of (textual) values of any property. Don't go wild with it though---only use it when it provides a better user experience.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
.clickableThing {
	cursor:pointer;
}
</pre>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Value</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>auto</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Default---the browser determines the cursor.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>default</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The default cursor you get when hovering over/selecting text</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>pointer</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The pointing hand that appears on links</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code><em>URL</em></code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>A comma-separated list of URLs to image files to use as a cursor (very fancy, but can be confusing)</p>

			<p>NOTE: You need to specify a standard cursor at the end, in case the browser can't find the image, otherwise this won't work</p>
			</td>
		</tr>

  title: "[CSS3] Pseudo-Classes"
  post: "<p>Pseudo-classes are a very powerful feature of CSS. Basically, they are an extra component you can add to a selector, that selects a group of elements dynamically. This means that it creates a class based on which state an element is in, which can be used, for example, to style elements differently when the user hovers over them.</p> 

<p>The syntax for pseudo-classes is <code><attr>:</attr>pseudo-class</code>---note the colon---and can be used in a selector just like any other component.</p>

<h2>Hover/Mouse Over</h2>

<p>To apply a different set of styles when the user hovers over the element, you can use the <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class. Most commonly used with links, but can be applied to <em>anything</em>.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
a:hover {
	color:red;
}
</pre>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>Because links take time to load, it is useful to style them differently when they are being clicked. That's when you use <code>:active</code>.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
a:active {
	border-bottom: 2px solid purple;
}
</pre>

<p>Similarly, because the text inside anchor tags can change, it's useful if you can show the user if he has already visited a certain link. The <code>:link</code> pseudo-class selects all unvisited links, while <code>:visited</code> selects all the visited ones.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
a:link {
	color:blue;
}
a:visited {
	text-transform:uppercase;
}
</pre>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>The input element is, of all elements, by far the most subject to change, and therefore has its own set of pseudo-classes.</p>

  title: "[CSS3] Pseudo-Elements"
  post: "<p>Much like pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements are special types of selector components. However, they are more powerful, as they define whole new elements. When you set these on an element, it takes a part of that element and allows you to give that its own whole set of styles.</p> 

<p><em>Why not just create extra elements in the HTML?</em> Because sometimes that is not possible or very hard/time-consuming to do, and adding those elements might ruin your semantic mark up.</p>

<p>The syntax for these is <code><attr>::</attr>pseudo-element</code>---note the double colon---and there's only five of them.</p>

<h2>Before &amp; After</h2>

<p>The <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> selectors insert dummy elements before and after the element, respectively. These elements are not added in the mark up or page structure, and exist only within those selectors, but are certainly visible and can be styled any way you like.</p>

<p>One extra property exists for these pseudo-elements, which is <code>content</code>. As expected, it specifies what content is placed within this dummy element. You can't, however, just put any HTML as its value---CSS has nothing do with mark up. Nevertheless, it does support these values:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Value</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code><em>"text"</em></code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Any text, but special characters have to be replaced by their Unicode values.</p>

			<p>For example, <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> becomes <code>\\00A0</code></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>url(<em>link</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>A link to an image.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>attr(<em>value</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The value of a certain attribute set on the element.</p>
			</td>

			</td>
			<td>
			<p>A closing quote</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

<pre data-lang="css">
p::before {
	content:"A"

}
p::after {
	content:"Z"
}
/*Places an A before and Z after every paragraph
</pre>

<h2>First Letter and Line</h2>

<p>The <code>::first-letter</code> pseudo-element selects the first letter of an element.</p>

<p>The <code>::first-line</code> pseudo-element selects the first line of an element.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
p::first-line {

</pre>

<h2>Selection</h2>

<p>Applies to what is currently being selected by the user. Its main use, therefore, is creating a different selection colour than the standard blue. But, it is quite limited, and only accepts the <code>color</code>, <code>background</code>, <code>cursor</code> and <code>outline</code> properties.</p>

  title: "[CSS3] Gradients"
  post: "<p>The last kind of image you can use in the background of your element, is a <strong>gradient</strong>. A gradient is a collection of background colours placed in a certain pattern. Usually, it is used to create a nice transition between multiple colours, but you can do quite a lot of things with it. Two types exist: <strong>linear</strong> and <strong>radial</strong> gradients. Gradients are created with the <code>background-image</code> property, which means this chapter is all about the different values for that property.</p> 

<p>NOTE: Because of that, if a browser doesn't support a certain gradient, it will fall back on the <code>background-color</code> property, so make sure you specify that as well.</p>

<h2>Linear Gradients</h2>

<p>Linear gradients start at one edge of the element, and move to the opposite side. This sounds as if they can only be horizontal or vertical, but they can be angled any way you like.</p>

<img src="media/CSS3LinearGradients.png" />

<p>The syntax is</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">linear-gradient(<em>direction, colour stops</em>)</code></p>

<h2>Direction</h2>

<p>The direction specifies the angle of the gradient. You can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Set it in degrees, by using a number with the unit <code>deg</code>.</li>
	<li>Point it towards a specific side of the element, using the word <code>to</code> and one of the following directions: <em>top left, top center, top right, center left, center right, bottom left, bottom center</em> and <em>bottom right</em></li>
</ul>

<p>These direction words have appeared before with background properties, but the difference this time is that you can't point a gradient towards the centre of an element, because the gradient wouldn't know what to do beyond that point (at the other half of the element).</p>

<h2>Colour Stops</h2>

<p>A colour stop is a certain point within the gradient where the colour is changed. You can specify as many as you like, in a comma-separated list, but you must specify at least one. In that case, the gradient is just a solid colour.</p>

<p>A colour stop requires two arguments: <code>colour</code> and <code>position</code>. The colour can be any valid CSS colour code, the position is a percentage. A gradient is always created from 0% to 100%, where 100% is the spot you pointed the gradient towards, and 0% the opposite end (<em>starting point</em>). If no position is set, all colour stops are distributed equally.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you set two colour stops with the same position, the colours don't gradually fade into each other, but immediately change into each other. This can be what you want, sometimes.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
body {
	background-image: linear-gradient(90deg, red 0%, blue 50%, yellow 100%);
}
div {
	background-image: linear-gradient(to left center, red 0%, blue 50%, yellow 50%, red 100%);
}
</pre>

<h2>Radial Gradients</h2>

<p>Radial gradients start at one point within the element, and move outwards in all directions, like a circle. Because they don't have one direction, the first parameter instead specifies where the gradient starts and how far it extends.</p>

<img src="media/CSS3RadialGradients.png" />

<p>The syntax is</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">radial-gradient(<em>settings, colour stops</em>)</code></p>

<h2>Radial Settings</h2>

<p>By default, if you don't set this argument, the gradient starts at the <em>center center</em> of the element, and extends all the way to the edges. This means that it becomes an ellipse if the element is not a perfect square.</p>

<p>This <em>shape</em> is the first thing we can change. By default, the first argument is <code>ellipse</code>, but you can force it into circular shape with <code>circle</code>.</p>

<p>To control the <em>size</em>, we can use a second argument, which has these values:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>closest-corner</code>: scales it until it reaches the closest corner</li>
	<li><code>closest-side</code>: scales it until it reaches the closest edge</li>
	<li><code>farthest-corner</code>: scales it until it reaches the farthest corner</li>
	<li><code>farthest-side</code>: scales it until it reaches the farthest side</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if we want the gradient to be completely within the element, we'd use the value <em>closest-side</em>.</p>

<p>And lastly, to control the <em>starting point</em>, we use a third argument which takes the same values as the <strong>direction</strong> with the linear gradient (so, <code>at <position></code>).</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
body {
	background-image: radial-gradient(circle closest-corner at left center, red 0%, blue 50%, yellow 100%);
}
</pre>

<h2>Repeating Gradients</h2>

<p>Both Linear and Radial gradients can be set to repeat, often to create a striped background. We simply use</p>

<p><code class="longsyntax">repeating-linear-gradient()
repeating-radial-gradient()</code></p>

<p>The size of one instance of the gradient is determined by the final colour stop, which means that you can't use percentages but must use absolute units (such as pixels) for the colour stops' positions. If you'd just use percentages, you wouldn't get a repeating gradient, because the first instance would fill up the whole element.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
body {
	background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(
		  45deg,
		  transparent,
		  transparent 10px,
		  rgba(50,50,50,0.1) 10px,
		  rgba(50,50,50,0.1) 20px

  title: "[CSS3] Transforms"
  post: "<p>CSS supports a whole array of 2D and 3D transformations. This means that you can easily move, rotate, skew or scale an element in 2D or 3D space. It's all done with the <code>transform</code> property, which means that you can supply a lot of different values to it. But, before we start, there's one other important property to learn about.</p> 

<p>NOTE: Transform only changes the appearance of an element. Elements surrounding it will not see the difference, and will not adapt to a transformed element. For example, if you rotate an image, the text around it will still flow around it as if it were a regular rectangle.</p>

<h2>Transform Origin</h2>

<p>The <code>transform-origin</code> property determines the origin for all transforms you're going to apply to the element. The 2D version takes two numbers, <strong>x-position</strong> and <strong>y-position</strong>, as arguments. The default is <code>50% 50%</code>, which is the centre of the element, and is often what you want. But you can set it to, for example, <code>0 0</code> if you want to rotate something along the top left corner.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	transform-origin:50% 50%;
}
</pre>

<p>A third value <em>can</em> be added for the <strong>z-position</strong> of the origin.</p>

<h2>2D Transforms</h2>

<p>When we speak of transforms, we always speak of the magic trio: translate, rotate and scale. You can change an element's position, rotation and size without changing the element itself. There is, however, a special addition with 2D transforms: skew (or shear). This does change an element's structure, as it only changes one half of the element, but is still seen as part of the transform family, because of its general usefulness.</p>

<img src="media/CSS3Transforms2D.png" />

<p>To apply multiple transforms, you need to separate them by a single <strong>white-space</strong>. You can apply as many as you like! Do keep in mind that the order in which you apply them matters.</p>

<h5>Translate</h5>

<p>Use <code><attr>translate(</attr><em>x,y</em><attr>)</attr></code> to move an element in both directions at once, or <code>translateX(<em>value</em>)</code> and <code>translateY(<em>value</em>)</code> to change them separately. The values can be any number.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	transform:translate(50px,-50px);
}
</pre>

<h5>Rotate</h5>

<p>Use <code><attr>rotate(</attr><em>angle</em><attr>)</attr></code>, where the angle can be any number with the unit <code>deg</code> (degrees).</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	transform: rotate(45deg);
}
</pre>

<h5>Scale</h5>

<p>Use <code><attr>scale(</attr><em>x-factor, y-factor</em><attr>)</attr></code>, where the factor is a number <em>without unit</em>, and 1 is the default scale.</p>

<p>You can use <code>scaleX(<em>factor</em>)</code> and <code>scaleY(<em>factor</em>)</code> to apply the transform to separate dimensions.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	transform: scale(1.2,1.6);
}
</pre>

<h5>Skew</h5>

<p>Use <code><attr>skew(</attr><em>x-angle, y-angle</em><attr>)</attr></code>.</p>

<p>There's also <code>skewX(<em>angle</em>)</code> and <code>skewY(<em>angle</em>)</code>.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	transform: skew(45deg,-45deg);
}
</pre>

<h2>3D Transforms</h2>

<p>The most notable change is the fact that, in 3D space, there's a lot more interesting rotations possible. Instead of only a horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axis, we can also use the <strong>z-axis</strong>, which is the imaginary line coming straight out of the screen.</p>

<img src="media/CSS3Transforms3D.png" />

<p>For the other properties---except skew---there are equivalents for the z-axis:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <code>translateZ(<em>value</em>)</code> and <code>scaleZ(<em>value</em>)</code> values to move or scale in the Z-direction</li>
	<li>The shorthand <code>translate3d(<em>x, y, z</em>)</code> and <code>scale3d(<em>x, y, z</em>)</code> to set all the values at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>But, I don't see much use for transfering these concepts to 3D, so let's continue with the rotation part!</p>

<h2>3D Rotations</h2>

<p>Now that we've got a 3D space going on, we can define rotations along all three axes.</p>

<p>This is done with: <code><attr>rotateX(</attr><em>angle</em><attr>)</attr></code>, <code><attr>rotateY(</attr><em>angle</em><attr>)</attr></code> and <code><attr>rotateZ(</attr><em>angle</em><attr>)</attr></code>.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	transform: rotateX(45deg) rotateY(10deg) rotateZ(-45deg);
}
</pre>

<p>There's also the shorthand <code>rotate3d(<em>x, y, z, angle</em>)</code>. Here, you set one angle (the fourth parameter), and the <em>x, y, z</em> values specify to what extent the axis is rotated by that angle.</p>

<p>For example, <code>rotate3d(1,0,0,45)</code> rotates the x-axis by 45 degrees. I know, it seems more complicated than it should be.</p>

<h2>3D World Settings</h2>

<p>A webpage is 2D by default, which means 3D is a whole different beast, and requires you to make some decisions about what to do.</p>

<p>The <code>transform-style</code> property determines what happens to the children of a transformed element. The default value is <code>flat</code>, which means that children are affected and taken into account, but you can set it to <code>preserve-3d</code> to let the children stay where they are.</p>

<p>The <code>perspective</code> property determines how far away or close by <em>children</em> of the element are placed. This can be any number. The default is 0, which means there is no difference in depth and the element appears flat.</p>

<p>The <code>perspective-origin</code> property sets the so-called <em>vanishing point</em> for this perspective. It takes two arguments, which represent the position on the <strong>x-axis</strong> and <strong>y-axis</strong>, respectively. These can be numbers, but you can also set them with those words you've become familiar with by now: <em>left, center, right</em> for the x-axis, <em>top, center, bottom</em> for the y-axis.</p>

<p>And finally, the <code>backface-visibility</code> property determines whether the back face of a 3D element, which you see if it's rotated, is visible. The default value is <code>visible</code>, but you can hide it with <code>hidden</code>.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	backface-visibility: hidden;
	transform-style: flat;
	perspective: 50px;
	perspective-origin:50% 0;
}

<p>Such a transition can take four arguments, of which the first two are compulsory:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Value</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>property</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The property to create a transition for.</p>

			<p>Anything with numbers or colours can be animated.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>duration</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>How long the transition takes to complete.</p>

			<p>Can be any positive number, with the unit <strong>s</strong> (seconds)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>timing-function</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>How this time is distributed, takes an <strong>easing function</strong> as value.</p>

			<p>For example, you can set it to transition quickly the first half and then slow down the second half.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>delay</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>How long it takes for the transition to start. Can be any positive number, with the unit <strong>s</strong>.</p>

			<p>Default is <strong>0s </strong>(transition starts immediately, which is often what you want).</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<pre data-lang="css">
a {
	transition: color 1s linear 0;
}
</pre>

<p>You can also set any of these values for transition as a whole, instead of specifying them for every property individually. For this, you can use the properties:</p>
<ul><li><code>transition-property</code></li><li><code>transition-duration</code></li><li><code>transition-timing-function</code></li><li><code>transition-delay</code></li></ul>

<pre data-lang="css">
a {
	transition-property: color, transform;
	transition-duration: 1s, 2s;
	transition-timing-function: linear, ease-in;
	transition-delay: 0s, 1s;
}
</pre>

<h2>Easing Functions</h2>

<p>An easing function is basically a graph, going from y=0% to y=100%. The way the graph goes (e.g., linear, parabolic), shows how fast or slow the transition is going at a certain moment in time.</p>

<img src="media/CSS3EasingFunctions.png" />

<p>These values are available:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Value</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>ease</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Semi-fast start, fast middle, slow finish. Default value.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>linear</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Same, constant speed from start to finish</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>ease-in</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Slow start, then constant speed</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>

			<p><code>ease-out</code></p>
			</td>

		</tr>

			</td>

			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>cubic-bezier(<em>a,b,c,d</em>)</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Your own custom easing function, with numbers between 0 and 1 as input.</p>

			<p>Quite tricky to explain, but think of it as (a/b) and (c/d) being the slope of the easing graph at start and end point, respectively.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Animations</h2>

<p>Animations take this concept one step further. You can define exactly what you want to happen, how, and when. Adding an animation to your element works in two steps: defining the animation, and calling the animation from the element.</p>

<h2>Defining Animations</h2>

<p>To define a single animation, we use the <code><attr>@keyframes</attr> <namehere></code> selector. You can use any name you like, as long as it doesn't contain any special characters. Within the selector, you need to specify which styles you want applied at what time within the animation. This is, in theory, the same as with gradients---you define certain time stops where you set new styles, and the animation automatically makes the values fade into each other nicely.</p>

<p>The syntax is <code><attr><percentage> {</attr> <em>styles</em> <attr>}</attr></code>, where 0% is the start of the animation, and 100% the end.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
@keyframes coolAnimation {
	0% { color:blue; }
	50% { color:red; }
	100% { color:blue; }
}
</pre>

<p>It's as simple as that! Now this general animation can be called from any element, which is what we'll look at next.</p>

<h2>Running the Animations</h2>

<p>This works roughly the same way as with transitions. You can set the properties:</p>

<ul><li><code>animation-name</code></li><li><code>animation-duration</code></li><li><code>animation-timing-function</code></li><li><code>animation-delay</code></li></ul>

<p>But, on top of that, some extra properties exist:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
<tr>
		<td>
			<p>Property</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description &amp; Values</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>animation-direction</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Defines how the animation is played.</p>

			<p><code>normal</code> is the default value (0% => 100%)</p>

			<p><code>reverse</code> plays the animation in reverse (100% => 0%)</p>

			<p><code>alternate</code> switches between normal and reverse</p>

			<p><code>alternate-reverse</code> switches between reverse and normal</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>animation-fill-mode</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Defines styles to apply to an element with an animation when it isn't being played.</p>

			<p><code>none</code> is the default value</p>

			<p><code>forwards</code> means that after the animation ends, the element keeps the last property values provided</p>

			<p><code>backwards</code> means that it already takes on the property values of the first time stop of the next iteration (in case the animation is paused or delayed).</p>

			<p><code>both</code> means that both <em>forwards</em> and <em>backwards</em> apply.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>animation-iteration-count</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>How often to play the animation</p>

			<p>Takes any positive number, without unit.</p>

			<p>Setting it to <code>infinite</code> keeps the animation playing forever and ever.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>animation-play-state</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Whether the animation is running or not.</p>

			<p><code>running</code> is the default value, which means that as soon as the element is loaded the animation starts</p>

			<p><code>paused</code> means it is paused, and you can decide for yourself when you start it.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

  title: "[CSS3] Responsive Design"
  post: "<p>I've mentioned the word several times already, but now that you've got all this basic (and advanced) CSS knowledge, we can finally take a peek into the world of responsive design. It's a large world, with lots of different ways to do lots of different things, but I will explain to you the fundamental concepts (and mostly properties) that play a role.</p> 

<p>Responsive design is design that adapts to different viewport sizes. It changes the layout depending on the room it has to display it. Websites that simply scale all elements to fit to different screen sizes, I like to call semi-responsive. It's a good idea, but a certain moment elements are just going to be too small to read. That's why there's an extra component to responsive design, which takes care of showing or hiding elements, and their placement on the page.</p>

<p><img src="media/CSS3ResponsiveDesign.png" /></p>

<p>There's three different parts you'll need to look at: HTML viewport settings, creating a fundamentally flexible CSS design, and writing different style sheets for specific sizes and devices.</p>

<h2>HTML Viewport</h2>

<p>HTML5 introduced a new attribute for the <code><meta></code> tag, which is <code><attr>name</attr>="viewport"</code>. Within the <code>content</code> attribute, you can set how you want devices to interpret your page when it comes to the scaling of elements.</p>

<p>If this tag isn't used, browsers will downscale websites to fit all content on tiny screens. This is okay, because the user can zoom in and view everything, but isn't really preferred.</p>

<p>To prevent this behaviour, set the value of the content attribute to <code>width=device-width;initial-scale:1.0;</code></p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<meta name="viewport" content="width:device-width;initial-scale:1.0;">
</pre>

<h2>Flexible CSS</h2>

<p>For this, the <strong>flexbox</strong> environment and <strong>multicolumn</strong> layout were invented, which is what next chapters are all about.</p>

<h2>Multiple style sheets</h2>

<p>Using so-called <strong>media queries</strong> you can specify when to use a certain style sheet. For example, if the viewport width is smaller than 500 pixels, you could completely change the layout to accommodate for that lack of space or different aspect ratio. After the flexible CSS chapters, the last chapter of the course is about this. Then, you can finally say you know everything that is CSS!</p>

  title: "[CSS3] Flexbox"
  post: "<p>Brace yourself, because this is going to be a long one, and all of it's important.</p> 

<p>A flexbox is a flexible box. You can tell an element to become a flexbox, and all children within it will become so-called flex items. From that moment on, everything inside the container will automatically adapt to changes, and there's a lot of properties you can use to specify <em>how</em> it adapts.</p>

<h2>Creating a Flexbox</h2>

<p>You convert an element into a flexbox by using <code><attr>display</attr>:flexbox</code> or <code><attr>display</attr>:inline-flexbox</code>, depending on whether you want it to be block level or inline. All its <em>direct children</em> (elements that have this flexbox element as their parent) automatically become flex items.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
#mainContainer {
	display:flex;
}
#mainContainer > div {
	/* This is automatically a flex-item */
}
#mainContainer div div {
	/* This is not */
}
</pre>

<h2>Settings for the Container Element</h2>

<p>Let's start by discussing the properties you can use on the container element, the one that you converted to a flexbox. These properties determine how all flex items are distributed throughout the container.</p>

<h5>Direction</h5>

<p>The <code>flex-direction</code> property establishes the main axis---the direction in which all elements will be laid out.</p>

<img src="media/CSS3FlexboxDirection.png" />

<p>Its values are <code>row</code> (left to right), <code>row-reverse</code> (right to left), <code>column</code> (top to bottom), and <code>column-reverse</code> (bottom to top).</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	flex-direction:row;
}
</pre>

<h5>Wrap</h5>

<p>By default, flexbox will try to fit all flex items into one row/column. The <code>flex-wrap</code> property can change that.</p>

<img src="media/CSS3FlexboxWrap.png" />

<p>The default value is <code>nowrap</code>. To make it wrap---that is, start a new row if it doesn't have any space anymore to place the next flex item---use the <code>wrap</code> value. Use <code>wrap-reverse</code> if you want flex items ordered right to left.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	flex-wrap:wrap;
}
</pre>

<h5>Justifying Content</h5>

<p>Just as text can be aligned, flex items can also be aligned in all sorts of ways. The <code>justify-content</code> property handles this.</p>

<img src="media/CSS3FlexboxJustify.png" />

<p>The possible values are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>flex-start</code>: items are floated towards the start line</li>
	<li><code>flex-end</code>: items are floated towards the end line</li>
	<li><code>center</code>: items are centred</li>
	<li><code>space-between</code>: the first item is floated towards the start line, the last item towards the end line, and the space in between is distributed evenly among the flex items</li>
	<li><code>space-around</code>: all flex items have an equal amount of space around it</li>
</ul>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	justify-content: space-between;
}
</pre>

<h5>Aligning Content</h5>

<p>I know, <code>align-content</code> seems as if this is the exact same thing as the previous property. But, this actually determines the alignment of the cross axis; the one perpendicular to the direction axis.</p>

<p>For example: if you set the direction to row, justify-content determines the horizontal alignment, but align-content determines the vertical alignment.</p>

<img src="media/CSS3FlexboxAlignContent.png" />

<p>It takes the same values, plus an additional one: <code>stretch</code>.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	align-content: stretch;
}
</pre>

<h5>Aligning Items</h5>

<p><em>What? Again?</em> No, this one is more specific. The <code>align-items</code> property doesn't determine how a complete row or column is aligned, but how items are laid out individually, relative to each other.</p>

<img src="media/CSS3FlexboxAlignItems.png" />

<p>The values it takes are</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>flex-start</code>: the top of every item is pushed against the top of the cross-axis</li>
	<li><code>flex-end</code>: the bottom of every item is pushed against the bottom of the cross-axis</li>
	<li><code>center</code>: all items are aligned at their own centre point</li>
	<li><code>baseline</code>: items are aligned in such a way that their baselines (imaginary line that all text sits on) align</li>
	<li><code>stretch</code>: stretch them all to fill the container. The default value.</li>
</ul>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	align-items: flex-end;
}
</pre>

<h2>Settings for the Flex Items</h2>

<p>All these properties for all items as a whole are great, but we often want some elements to have a unique size or position. You should, therefore, think of these properties as overriding the main behaviour. First you set the main properties on your whole flexbox, and then you start tweaking them for some individual flex items---not the other way around.</p>

<h5>Basic Size</h5>

<p>The <code>flex-basis</code> property determines the basic size of a flex item. The default value is <code>auto</code>, which means it scales to fit the flex container, or looks at the width/height properties if you've set those. If you set it to 0, it only scales to fit the content. If you supply it any other number, it will make it that long on the main axis (so it influences width if the flexbox is set to row, and height if set to column).</p>

<img src="media/CSS3FlexboxBasis.png" />

<pre data-lang="css">
#specialDiv {
	flex-basis: 200px;
}
</pre>

<h5>Growing and Shrinking</h5>

<p>When the remaining space is distributed, that space can be positive or negative. Positive space means we have some space left over and could scale some items to fill it, while negative space means we're taking up too much space and need to reduce the size of some items.</p>

<p>For the first case, we have <code>flex-grow</code>, and for the second there's <code>flex-shrink</code>.</p>

<img src="media/CSS3FlexboxGrowShrink.png" />

<p>They both accept a factor---a number with no unit. The default is 1, which means an item simply stays at the same scale.</p>

<p>NOTE: Because it's a factor, it doesn't say exactly how much something can or will scale, but rather how much space it receives or loses relative to the other flex items.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
#bigDiv {
	flex-grow: 2;
}
#smallDiv {
	flex-shrink: 3;
}
</pre>

<h5>Overriding Alignment</h5>

<p>If you want a single flex item to be aligned differently than is determined in the general <code>align-items</code> property, you need to use the <code>align-self</code> property, which takes the same values.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
#weirdDiv {
	align-self: flex-start;
}
</pre>

<h5>Order</h5>

<p>And finally, if you want the items to appear in a different order than you specified in the HTML, you can use the <code>order</code> property. Its value is an integer---a ranking number with no unit, so to speak. This can be negative as well, if you want.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
#weirdDiv {
	order: 5;
}
#firstDiv {
	order: -10;
}
</pre>

<p><em>Why wouldn't I just put elements in the correct order in the source?</em> Well, for example, the homepage of this website uses a flexbox with the order property randomly determined to get a different front page every time you visit! There could also be semantic reasons you'd want the HTML elements to be in a certain order, but the layout in another.</p>

  title: "[CSS3] Multicolumn"
  post: "<p>Another type of flexible environment, which can be used specifically for text, is the <strong>multi-column</strong> layout. It's a layout that is somehow very popular in print, but---until recently---not at all on the web. A good reason for this could be because it was hard to implement it, and that bottleneck seems to disappear with these new multi-column properties. Don't worry, it's not as difficult and large as flexbox.</p> 

<img src="media/CSS3MultiColumn.png" />

<h2>Declaring columns</h2>

<p>You can make any block level element a column layout. This is done with the <code>columns</code> property, which takes two values: <code>column-count</code> and <code>column-width</code>. You can set these properties individually if you like, but it's always recommended to set them both using the shorthand.</p>

<h5>Column Count</h5>

<p>Sets the amount of columns. No matter how wide the element is, that amount of columns is used, and all columns are scaled to make it fit. Takes an <strong>integer</strong> (without unit) as a value.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	column-count:5;
}
</pre>

<h5>Column Width</h5>

<p>The other way to do it, is by setting a fixed column width and letting that decide how many columns should be used. It takes any <strong>number</strong> as a value, and all columns will always be that width.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	column-width:500px;
}
</pre>

<h2>The Shorthand Property</h2>

<p>Now why is it recommended to set them both? Because then things become responsive! If both are set, column-width only determines the <em>minimum</em> width, and column-count the <em>maximum</em> amount of columns.</p>

<p>If you then resize your browser window, it will remove or add columns based on how much space there is---and that is what you want.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	columns:500px 5;
}
</pre>

<h2>Column Gap</h2>

<p>The <code>column-gap</code> property determines the amount of white space between two columns. The default values is 1em, and it takes any non-negative number as value.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	column-gap:20px;
}
</pre>

<h2>Column Rule</h2>

<p>The <code>column-rule</code> property allows you to add a <em>border</em> in that column gap. It, therefore, also uses the same syntax as borders, and can also be set individually with <code>column-rule-width</code>, <code>column-rule-style</code> and <code>column-rule-color</code>.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	column-rule:1px solid #CCC;
}
</pre>

<h2>Column Span</h2>

<p>And finally, the <code>column-span</code> property allows you to break elements out of the column flow. The default value is <code>1</code>, which means that any element within the column environment spans one column only. The only other value it can have is <code>all</code>, which means that the element is moved downwards to be able to span across all columns, and then the column layout continues again. Mostly useful for headings or pictures within a column environment.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
div {
	columns: 200px 3;
}
div h1 {
	column-span:all;
}

  title: "[CSS3] Counters & Filters"
  post: "<p>Counters and filters are completely unrelated, but they are too small to give their own chapter. They aren't used often at all, but sometimes they are <em>exactly</em> what you need, and they can simplify your life quite a bit.</p> 

<h2>Counters</h2>

<p>Counters are variables maintained by CSS. You can ask CSS to count how often it finds an element, and display that information somewhere. It's often used to create fancy numbered lists, or to dynamically number pages or slides on a website. It can only be used with the <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements.</p>

<p>The <code>counter-reset</code> property <em>sets</em> as well as <em>resets</em> a counter. It takes any name you want to give it as value. As always, no special characters are allowed in that name. From the first moment you use this property, CSS can use that name as variable, and it's only reset once you call it again.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
ul {
	counter-reset:coolCounter;
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>counter-increment</code> property adds to the counter. If you only supply the counter name, it increments it with 1. If you add a value after it, it adds that value.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
li {
	counter-increment:coolCounter;
}
.evenList li {
	counter-increment:coolCounter 2;
}
</pre>

<p>Now, to display the value of the counter at the moment this element is evaluated, use <code><attr>counter(</attr><counter name><attr>)</attr></code>. Remember, therefore, that the order of all these CSS declarations is important. Also remember that you need to supply this value to the <code>content</code> property, because we're working with before and after pseudo-elements.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
li::before {
	content:counter(coolCounter);
}
</pre>

<p>For <strong>subsections</strong>, use <code><attr>counters(</attr><counter name>, <separator><attr>)</attr></code> to get all instance of your counter, added together using the separator. This can be useful, for example, if you have a list within a list.</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
li::before {
	content: counter(coolCounter, ".");
}
</pre>

<h2>Filters</h2>

<p>Filters can be used on an image, and it is exactly what it sounds like. You can use the <code>filter</code> property on an image to add a nice filter to it, and you can give it these values:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>

<p>You can use <strong>multiple filters</strong>! As long as you separate them with a white-space.</p>

  title: "[CSS3] Media Queries"
  post: "<p>Even if you've done everything you can to make your CSS flexible and scalable, it's possible some things don't work out. If that is the case, you have one last option to resort to: media queries. You check the type of media and the size of the viewport, and apply a different or extra style sheet for it. Of course, writing such a statement for <em>every</em> possible device is tedious, which means most people group them using max-width and min-width features.</p> 

<p>A media query always has the following syntax:</p>

<pre data-lang="css">
@media mediatype and (media feature) {
    /* Your CSS Code */
}
</pre>

<p>As you can see, we query the media with <code>@media</code>, use a few special selectors, and then write CSS selectors and declarations like we're used to.</p>

<p>You could, if you want, write these CSS rules in a separate file and link to it using the HTML <code><link></code> tag in the head of your page:</p>

<pre data-lang="html">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="mediatype and|not|only (media feature)" href="myspecialstylesheet.css">
</pre>

<p>I must admit I've never used that, but if your style sheets get really large, it might be a wise thing to do.</p>

<h2>Media Types</h2>

<p>There's 4 different media types you can apply:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Media Type</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>all</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Selects all media types</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>print</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Selects printers</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>speech</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Selects screen reader that read the page out loud.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><code>screen</code></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Selects everything else---that is, everything that has a screen. Computers, tablets, smartphones, etcetera.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>As you might have guessed, the <strong>all</strong> and <strong>screen </strong>keywords are used most often.</p>

<h2>Media Features</h2>

<p>There are <em>a lot</em> of values for this one, but I'll focus on the most important ones.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Media Feature</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Description</p>

  title: "[CSS3] Conclusion: what now?"
  post: "<p>Pfew, that was a long journey into the world of CSS, but you've seen, touched and tasted it all. Still, it was very quick and bare bones, and the only way to get comfortable with how everything works is by experimenting and building projects.</p> 

<p>Using HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge, you can build a very beautiful and well-structured website. You can try to build your own homepage now, or a blog, or anything you like. But, you'll soon run into some problems, which is that you can't really make your websites dynamic. Yes, you can add an animation when somebody hovers over a button---but how do you make the button do something when the user clicks on it?</p>

<p>That's what JavaScript is for. It's a scripting language---the name does give it away a little---that adds interaction and dynamic to your website. You can do virtually anything with it, and I recommend you learn that now. Just as CSS, it has its own syntax and whole set of rules and basic concepts, but was made to work and integrate perfectly with CSS and HTML, which makes things easier.</p>

<p>However, if you want to learn how to save websites on a server, and upload and load data from it (like blog posts, your own files, portfolio images), you're better off learning PHP now.</p>

<p>Either way, I think in the end you want to master both, and it's up to you where you want to start. The web is a wonderful place, but if you really want to know what's behind it, and create your own wonderful projects from scratch, there's some work to be done ;) Have fun!</p>

<p>NOTE (last one, I promise): CSS3 is constantly evolving. I recommend checking MDN once in a while to see what's new, what's in, and what's out. Sometimes features become deprecated and are removed from browsers, other times an amazing new idea is adopted by all browsers within mere months.</p>
