Being healthy and being fit are often seen as synonyms. While they do cover a lot of the same ground, there are also some fundamental differences.

**Being Fit** means having good stamina, lots of muscle power (even though it is not obvious from the outside), being able to do all daily tasks efficiently and without getting tired too quickly, being able to sport for at least 30 minutes. Being fit has everything to do with exercising enough, exercising the right way and good posture.

**Being Healthy** means having no excess body fat, eating the right products and the right amount of them, getting enough sleep and rest, doing your daily tasks in a healthy manner. You could be very strong from weightlifting, but still not healthy. On the other hand, you could be healthy but still lack any reasonable stamina.

Therefore, where these two areas overlap, is that if you take care of them both, they will strengthen each other. Sleeping well makes you healthy, but also increases fitness\-\--you feel more energized, your muscles have had better rest, etc. Doing exercises removes fat and increases your desire to eat proper foods. This guide will therefore tackle both of them.

## The Advantages

I've already mentioned a lot of the advantages of becoming fit and healthy above, but here are the key points why you should do it:

-   Removes fat, replaces it with muscles\-\--the look as well as
    functioning of your body will increase.
-   Increases stamina and energy\-\--you can do more in a day, feel less
    tired and appear brighter and vivid towards others.
-   Increases your mood\-\--exercising, having healthy foods in your
    system and having a correct upright posture all release hormones
    that lift your mood and spirit.
-   It is fun\-\--believe it or not, but doing a sport and becoming
    better and better at it over time is fun and motivating.
-   If you have any sort of injury or weak spot in your body, exercising
    is the way to get rid of it and make it strong again. I know you may
    be thinking you can't exercise because it hurts so much or it
    isn't strong enough, but doing sports really is the only way to get
    back on track.

## But, I have to warn you

Nothing comes free in life. Giving yourself one day off once in a while is okay, even a very wise thing to do, but you have to work and push yourself every day to achieve that good-looking body. Even if you are really not in the mood, are pressed for time, or are making up all sorts of excuses not to do it\-\--doing only five push-ups a day already makes a difference, as does swapping one unhealthy eating habit for a better one.

Also, being fit and healthy does **not** mean extremely thin. I know, some people just are born that way and it's impossible for them to gain any weight, but for most people it is much more healthy to have some body fat. There's a reason our body is so eager to store fat, and you shouldn't eat too little and exercise too much.

But, the advantages outweigh the time and effort you will spend easily, so just do it!

"\[Fitness/Health\] Correct Posture (Part 1)" post: "

Most of us don't realise how incredibly important your back or upper part of your body is. Your back (spine) is what sends signals from the brain to the rest of your body, and if anything there is obstructed or damaged, it will affect your body in a very negative way. On top of that, it also contains your vital organs, and you certainly don't want those to be suppressed.

I could list all the advantages here, but it all comes down to the fact that with correct posture you're always using your body in the best way possible (optimal flow of oxygen and signals from the brain, but also optimal body strength).

But, the problem is that most people have a bad posture without knowing it. And because your body always has some sort of posture (sleeping, sitting, walking, standing), it's hard to get rid of a bad posture you've had for years, or maybe decades.

## What is Correct Posture?

What correct posture is depends a bit on whether you are sitting, standing or lying down. But there are some fundamentals:

-   Being able to draw a straight line from your ears to (the middle of)
    your ankles. It should go through your shoulders, hips and knees as
    well.
    -   Your knees should **never** be locked.
    -   If you're sitting, forget about the knees of course.
-   Having your shoulders pulled back and downwards a bit. Most people
    have their shoulders hanging forward a bit, which is not only bad
    for the spine position, but also for the strength and freedom of the
    shoulders.
    -   Do **not** pull shoulders only backwards, or only downwards. At
        the bottom of your shoulder blades, near your spine, there is a
        big muscle that connects them to the rest of your back.
        Contracting this muscle automatically moves the shoulders
        diagonally into their good position, and it is the **only**
        muscle that you should train and feel.
-   Having a vertically straight neck, and chin a bit tucked in to keep
    your head perpendicular to the neck and looking forward.
-   Having a slight S-curve in your back. Even though you must be able
    to draw a straight line, doesn't mean your back should be perfectly
    straight. It's shape resembles that of a stretched out S, and that
    is the natural and best shape for it to be in. So even though your
    shoulders and hips should be on the same level, there should be a
    bit of a curve in your back between those two points.
-   Making your **abs** do the work. If you a trying to get a correct
    posture, you should only feel your abs. Therefore, it is good to
    strengthen them or to engage them while standing.

These were all the key points if you're looking from the side, but the front and back also want some attention:

-   You should look **symmetrical.** This means that the left and right
    shoulder should be at the same level, and form a perfect rectangle
    with your feet. Your head should not rotate slightly to one side,
    and your hips should also not be rotated or twisted. If this is the
    case, and it is hard for you to get rid of, there might be something
    else wrong and you should see a doctor.

## Check your Posture

There are a few simple experiments you can do to check how your posture is doing.

**Wall Test 1**

-   Stand with your back against the wall.
-   Make sure your head, shoulders, butt and ankles are slightly
    touching the wall.
-   There should be space between your lower back and the wall, and your
    knees should not be locked but also have some space.
-   If you're able to stand this way (without some parts hurting too
    much), you have found correct posture.

**Wall Test 2**

-   Stand with your back against the wall
-   Make sure your head, shoulders and lower back are slightly touching
    the wall.
-   Your feet should be a few inches away from the wall.
-   Standing like this focusses only on getting the correct posture in
    the upper part of your body.

**Book Test**

-   A bit less useful, but more fun.
-   Put a book on top of your head, and see if you can keep it there for
    a long time (without hands, of course) without having to move and do
    all sorts of head and neck movements. If you can do this, at least
    your head and neck have good posture and strength, and your body has
    good balance.

I've split the article on correct posture in two, as it was getting a bit too long and I don't wanted to leave anything out on this very important subject.

## How to Train Correct Posture

What I described above should really be seen as tests or checks, and not as exercises. They do not really strengthen muscles or create better habits, they just let you experience what good posture feels like.

The first and most important way to train it, is just to exercise these principles. Try to notice when you're shifting into your old, bad posture and then actively make yourself sit in the correct one for a minute before moving on. This may seem hard and unnatural at first. Your muscles aren't used to the way they're being worked now, so they may tire really quickly or feel a bit stiff. If you train regularly and don't put an enormous amount of pressure on them, this is good pain and will fade away. If it keeps hurting more and more, you're overdoing it or something else is wrong.

Another exercise, is to stand in correct posture and then move both your arms up until they're perfectly horizontally aligned with your shoulders. Keep them there, and perhaps wave your arms up and down a little. This is extremely hard to do, but it targets the right muscles for correct posture and upper body strength very well.

If you're experiencing great pain in the neck, shoulders of back from doing all this, it is better to first **stretch:**

-   **Neck.** Move/stretch it in all 4 directions (left, right, up,
    down), but do it gradually (takes about 10 seconds to get to a point
    you can't go further). Rolling it around in a circle is not
    recommended.
-   **Shoulders.** Put your hands behind your back, and pull your
    shoulders backwards. This is not good posture, just stretching. Then
    put your hands up in the air (still behind your back) as far as you
    can, and this should already be hard to do and feel like stretching
    while holding that posture.

While doing these exercises, make sure to keep everything as relaxed as possible. I know you're training and pushing it to be in a different posture, but if you try to move to fast you'll only strain and hurt yourself more. Don't expect good posture in a few days, build it up in small steps and expect perfect posture in six months.

## How do I apply it in daily situations?

##### Standing

Put your body weight on the front of your feet, as putting it on the heels naturally calls for a passive body stance.

It can help to think as if a string at the top of your head is pulling it towards the ceiling.

You should be looking straight forward. Most people have the tendency to look a bit downwards, pull your head back up to stop that bad habit.

##### Sitting

Same principles apply. Keep everything straight. Even your feet, as most people are inclined to put cross them or disturb the symmetry in any way.

Your back should also be straight, and you should not be leaning backwards or forwards too much. However, lots of chairs these days are of better quality, and pushing your lower back into the backrest also creates good posture. If you have to change your position or get something, do that by rotating your head **and** upper body instead of straining your back or turning the head too much.

When working at a table, make sure the angle between your lower arm and upper arm is between 45 to 90 degrees. Less than that might overstretch the elbow, more than that means you are sitting way too high.

Also, go stand once in a while. We're not made to sit around all day, so most people don't feel too comfortable sitting with correct posture for a long time.

##### Walking

Some people feel like they need to put their head or neck forward for some reason\-\--don't do that. Even when running, keep your upper body straight and let your legs and abs do all the work.

Also, try to put a little 'bounce' or hip movement into your walk. Not only does it look sexy, it also makes sure you use your whole body in a healthy way when walking.

##### Carrying things

Standing in correct posture makes it harder to reach things you could reach by moving your shoulder forward or curving your back. But, there are simple alternatives: stand closer to the object, and make your
**legs** do all the work.

When you're carrying something, keep it as close to your body as you can. This makes lifting easier.

##### Sleeping

Don't sleep on your stomach. Sleep on your back.

If you like sleeping on your side, stick a small pillow between your knees to even then keep the body symmetrical.

Also, make sure you either have a very deformable pillow or one that's flat and precisely the distance between your shoulder and neck. Most pillows are just a big sort-of-rectangle, sort-of-ball of softness. While it is indeed very soft, your neck is not straight when using those, and they are often not high enough to support your shoulder width.

## For the lovers, here's all benefits in a nice list

-   **Improved organ function:** When you're standing up straight,
    you're giving your organs all the space they need to work well. If
    you don't, your rib cage will start to push against the organs and
    that they do not like.
-   **Improved flow of blood and signals from the brain:** As said
    before, your back makes sure all signals from the brain go to
    everywhere in the body. When you have a lot of tension in the back,
    a lot of these signals might be lost as there's some sort of block
    before they go to the rest of the body. This results in your body
    not knowing where to grow muscle, where to send blood to, what and
    how to develop, etc. Also, I myself had a problem with my left
    shoulder being a bit out of place and tensed up for a few years, and
    had serious problems with my heart as a result of the things pushing
    it out of place and cutting of the blood flow.
-   **Reduced tension:** Simple, if everything is in the correct place,
    there's no need for tension.
-   **Increased cognitive performance:** Studies have shown that people
    who slouch are more (easily) depressed than others, which is mostly
    a result of the fact that they don't have good concentration and
    sometimes can't think clearly. This can all be solved by correcting
    your posture!
-   **Increased height:** Studies have also shown that, for some reason,
    taller men are liked better. On the other hand, there seems to be a
    lot of people negative about tall women, but I personally don't see
    the problem with that at all. And it's not like people can do that
    much about their length.
-   **Prevents humped shoulders, beer bellies and other not-so-great
    stuff:** When you're young, you're flexible enough to adapt and
    still look great. But, once you get older a lot of complications
    come into play, and these can all (for a part) be solved by having
    correct posture.
-   **Increased confidence:** Somehow related to the 'increased
    height', standing up straight, looking forward (not down), gives a
    confident look and will actually make you feel confident.

It's common knowledge that sleeping is good for your health. But how many hours should you sleep every night? What should we do before we go to bed, and after we wake up? Why exactly is it good for you? I'll try to answer these questions as well as I can.

But I have to add, even scientists are still not completely sure why we sleep, how it works and what exactly happens. I only provide the information that has been tested and results in feeling more rested for everyone.

## How much should I sleep?

That depends on your age, and a bit on your DNA. Some people needs lots of sleep, some don't\-\--there is nothing you can do about that. But here is a list of the average sleeping hours per age category:

-   **Newborns** (0-2 months): 12\-\--18 hours
-   **Infants** (3-11 months): 14\-\--15 hours
-   **Toddlers** (1-3 years): 12\-\--14 hours
-   **Preschoolers** (3-5 years): 11\-\--13 hours
-   **School-age children** (5-10 years): 10\-\--11 hours
-   **Teens** (10-17) years: 8\-\--9.5 hours
-   **Adults:** 7-9 hours

You will notice that the amount of sleep you need becomes less and less as you age. But still, around 8 hours of sleep is an amount that many people almost never reach. As you are most likely to be in one of the last two categories, the absolute minimum amount of sleep you should get Is **7 hours**.

## But that's impossible?!

Let's see about that. You probably want at least an hour to get stuff done in the morning, and at night you also want at least an hour of spare time. Then wouldn't sleeping from **12 pm**\-\--**7 am** be a nice fit? You get your hours of sleep, and you get enough time for fun stuff.

## Still, can't do it.

But then you might say: I don't immediately fall asleep as soon as I lie down, and I don't wake up at the same time every day.

That is true for most people, and it has a lot to do with what sleeping actually is.

We fall asleep when we're tired, relaxed and our eyes haven't had stimuli for some time. I will provide you with a few tips and tricks in a few paragraphs about how you can make sure that happens and trick your body into sleeping earlier.

We wake up when our body feels rested enough or there's lots of light in the room. Waking up naturally is always better than by alarm clock, but because it is very much unpredictable, most people have to use one. If you want to know, I explain a bit about the theory or science behind sleeping at the end.

## Tips & Tricks

-   **Schedule.** Most important of all, is having a sleeping rhythm.
    Sometimes life gets crazy and you cannot afford sleeping late, or
    going to bed early. Most people solve this by sleeping more than
    usual on the days they have some free time. While this system of
    catching up with your sleeping amount is always better than becoming
    sleep deprived, it is not the best way to do it. If you make sure
    that you go to bed a quarter to 12 *every evening* and put an alarm
    clock around a quarter to 7 *every morning**,*** you will soon
    enough get into a rhythm. And your body likes that.
    -   **Why?** Because your body knows that it has those 7 hours to
        get everything done it wants to do. It knows when to shut down
        the body and fall asleep, and when it will be woken up. It
        smooths out these two processes and makes them faster, but also
        learns to use the time in between most efficiently.
-   **Rest before going to bed.** If you want to fall asleep within
    10-15 minutes of going to bed, you need to make sure your body is
    rested and doesn't want to do anything anymore. This means to
    **stop eating or drinking** anything **2 hours** before you go to
    bed, don't exercise an **hour** before going to bed, and of course
    don't do other crazy stuff (drinking alcohol or caffeine-filled
    products for example).
-   **Have a nice place to sleep.** Make sure your bed is clean, make
    sure the temperature is okay (a bit below room temperature), make
    sure there's no light at night. If you can, do try to have lots of
    sunshine in the morning, as that is the most natural and healthy way
    to wake up. Also keep in mind the things you learned in the *correct
    posture* article about sleeping without hurting your body.
-   **Don't worry.** Everybody in this world goes to bed and starts to
    think about what they did wrong today, what they will have to do
    tomorrow, etcetera\-\--don't. This seems healthy to most problems,
    as you are mostly solving problems and thinking deeply about
    subjects. But because you are so darn active, it is almost
    impossible to fall asleep. Your brain actually solves problems
    you've thought about before while you sleep, so its best you don't
    postpone it. If you are awake and actively thinking about problems,
    most people have the tendency to mostly worry and not actually try
    to solve or think positively.

## Science of Sleeping

Sleeping has at its core a single purpose: shut down everything we don't need, so that we can regrow our body. When you sleep, your muscles grow, your energy reserve refills, any wounds are healed and harmful viruses dealt with. But, the most important part is in your brain.

Your brain uses sleep to put all sorts of things you've learned, seen and experienced that day into the long-term memory. It tries to build strong connections between what you already had and what you did that day. Not sleeping enough therefore causes memory loss, depression, problems with focussing\-\--a whole array of mental problems, on top of the physical ones.

There are basically two stages your body alternates between when you sleep. There is the **REM sleep** most people know (Rapid Eye Movement, or otherwise called **light sleep**), and a stage which we'll call
**deep sleep** or non-REM sleep.

The first REM sleep stage lasts about 10 minutes, but they get longer and longer after that (the final one usually lasts an hour). Your eyelids move rapidly, you breathe faster and heart rate rises. This is the stage where your brain is most active, and **dreams** are made here.

The non-REM sleep lasts anywhere between 5 to 15 minutes. It has three stages:

1.  You're not really sleeping. Your eyes are closed, but it is very
    easy to wake you up.
2.  Your heart rate slows and body temperature drops. This is basically
    preparation for deep sleep, and REM sleep.
3.  Deep sleep. It is very hard to wake you up, and if you wake up you
    feel weak, disoriented and maybe even sick.

Your body typically tries to wake up during stage 1 of non-REM sleep. You should see it like this: you close your eyes and tell your body it is fine to go to sleep. Your body prepares REM sleep, performs the REM stage, and then performs a check 'can I wake up?' If there's still work to be done or it's still dark, it will continue this cycle.

Using an alarm clock therefore increases your chances of waking up at the wrong time. If you wake up from your alarm clock and you can barely open your eyes, you've disturbed REM sleep. If you wake up, and you feel even worse than you did before you went to bed\-\--you've cut your deep sleep. Therefore, getting in a rhythm so that your body knows when to stop doing stuff and wake up is a very wise thing to do.

Supplying yourself with enough water and nutrients every day is the most important part in being healthy, by a long margin. Eating the right products at the right time increases how you look, feel and function. Eating the wrong products, or not eating much at all is, dramatically speaking, the same as slowly killing yourself.

Your body is continuously burning through its reserves to keep your heart beating, lungs going and brain functioning. It therefore needs the right product, in the right amount at the right time. Now this sounds like it's an exact science, but it isn't. I will explain to you in this article the basic fundamentals and rules from which you need to make your decision, but no exact portions or anything like that are given. That depends on your body, and you should feel when it is too little or too much.

## Some genetics

Everyone has a different body. This means that there is a different rate at which nutrients are processed, but also a different ratio on how much is stored as fat, used to grow muscles or used for energy. There are roughly speaking two types we can distinguish here:

-   **The forever lean.** There are lots of people who are skinny, and
    just can't do anything about it. Everything they eat is immediately
    converted into energy, controlling body temperature, brain function,
    etcetera. These people can eat whatever they want without
    accumulating fat, but it is very hard to grow any muscle.
-   **The powerful plump.** On the other hand, for a lot of people it is
    almost impossible to lose weight. Everything they eat is almost
    immediately stored as fat, if not used for growing muscles. These
    people therefore need to really closely watch what they eat, but a
    lot of what they eat is put into a more muscular body\-\--that's
    their advantage.

Most people sit somewhere between these two categories, but for both this still rings true: the amount you eat is not as important as **what you eat**. The skinny ones can eat whatever they like and stay skinny, but if they only eat fast foods they are still going to be unhealthy and running the risk of heart disease.

You probably know what I am talking about and have come to terms with whatever type you are. It is important to know that and keep in mind, but know that it is not impossible for skinny people to grow muscle and plump people to be lean and fit if you work hard enough.

## How much should I weigh?

Before we can discuss what you need to do to get to ideal weight, we need to determine *what is the ideal weight?*

Well, it depends. On your age, length and overall body shape.

The best way to check it is therefore simply looking in the mirror. Stand straight, and check if there is a very noticeable amount of fat on your belly. If it is only slightly noticeable, you're fine. And most below that is also okay, but if you start to see bones through your skin or get a six-pack without ever having trained your abs\-\--you're eating far too little.

However, as this still might seem vague, there is something called the
**BMI** (Body Mass Index) which you can calculate for yourself. It works like this:

\> BMI = weight / (height \* height)

With weight in *kilograms* and height in *meters*. Then your result gives you an indication:

-   BMI \< **18.5**: People with this are *underweight*.
-   18.5 \< BMI \< **25:** You have the ideal body weight!
-   25 \< BMI \< **30**: People with this are *overweight*.
-   BMI \> **30**: People with this suffer from *obesity.*

Now this test is quite accurate and in most cases true, except for
**trained athletes**. A square inch of muscle is heavier than a square inch of fat, so if you have very well-grown muscles, you will most likely be classified as overweight, and in very rare cases as obese. In that case you shall have to decide for yourself!

**Body Fat**

One last thing before we can continue, and it is about body fat. Body fat is usually given in percentages\-\--the percentage of your body that is fat. I'll give you a little overview of the percentages (for women and men respectively):

Women

Men

Essential fat.

10\-\--13%.

2\-\--5%

Athletes.

14\-\--20%

6\-\--13%

Fitness.

21\-\--24%

14\-\--17%

Average.

25\-\--31%

18\-\--24%

Obese.

Over 32%

Over 25%.

Now, what does this tell you? That a certain amount of fat is required. Without that essential fat, you would look very bad and most probably die very soon. Fat is good, if you have it in small amounts. You can see that the average person has quite a lot of it, and that if you for example only have 18%, you are doing very well. So don't try too hard to remove all fat, it's better to look fit and healthy than as if you haven't eaten in weeks.

*How do I measure body fat?* It is not really (easily) measurable using some sort of formula, so I suggest you look up pictures for the percentages and see with which one you can compare yourself.

## Eating at the right times

*When* you consume your food (and drinks), is equally as important as
*what* you eat. If you wake up in the morning, your body has been doing a lot but you haven't eaten for let's say 8 or 9 hours. You can eat as healthy as you like, if you skip the breakfast you will still feel like you're lacking energy. Therefore, these tips are useful to keep in mind:

-   Eat at least **3 big meals** every day: one in the morning
    (breakfast), afternoon (lunch) and evening (dinner)
    -   This should provide you with basic nutrition to get through the
        whole day.
-   Eat small, lightweight meals (snacks) throughout the day
    -   Do this to make sure your metabolism keeps working at speed and
        prevent you from overeating yourself at one of the 3 big meals.
        It also provides a little burst of energy and stills your hunger
        a bit.
-   **Drink water** before, during and after any meal. If you just drink
    water regularly through the day, that is fine as well.
    -   Water is *extremely* essential for your body. It makes sure all
        waste products are removed, it is crucial for building anything
        in your body, performing core functions, keeps your blood
        pressure at a good level and keeps your stomach going (read: it
        prevents stomach aches).
-   Make your **breakfast** the healthiest and largest meal of your day,
    and certainly don't skip it!
    -   There are two things crucial to how you feel on a day: how well
        you slept and your breakfast. Breakfast is supposed to get your
        body started again and provide you with enough energy to
        properly wake up. If you don't eat breakfast, eat too quick or
        the wrong things, there's a great chance you just ruined the
        rest of your day. Include at least *grains* (brown bread,
        cereal) and *fruit*.
-   Don't eat big meals after dinner, especially if you're not going
    to exercise anymore.
    -   When you sleep, and I mean really deep sleep, you don't process
        food anymore. Therefore, if you eat anything less than 2 hours
        before going to bed, your body will try to process it before you
        can fall asleep. This causes you to lie awake in bed, not being
        able to fall asleep\-\--but it also tries to speed up the
        process and stores much more of your food as fat, and not as
        something useful.

## Eating the right way

You might think 'eh, well, I think I already know how to eat. I have been doing it my whole life'. That is true, but there are still some improvements to be made to how long and in what way you should eat. And all of this has to do with the **hunger signal**.

When you get the hunger signal ('hmm, I feel a bit hungry'), you should immediately find something to eat. If you hold on to some sort of eating schedule every day, that signal will usually come at the right time. If you don't, or can't for some reason, you should also have some food with you or near you.

Because, if you don't start eating soon, there's two things that will happen. First of all, because your body is saying it is running out of resources\-\--it will start malfunctioning if you don't provide them. Second of all, the moment you see food again you'll be inclined to eat very fast (because you're so hungry). And eating fast isn't good.

**Why?** Multiple reasons. It takes around 20 minutes for your brain to get the signal it's not hungry anymore. If you eat fast, you always eat more than you really need, because during those 20 minutes you will have eaten much more than you'd usually do. On top of that, eating fast means you're chewing and processing your food less than usually. This means that not all the good things inside can be absorbed by the body, and half of the food is wasted.

Therefore, to eat healthy, you need to **eat slower**. You need to
**chew more**, **drink lots of water** and talk with family members or colleagues **between bites**. This ensures you focus on what you are eating, and gives your body time to wait for the 'I am full' signal.

Also, don't eat while watching TV, a movie or doing some other distracting activity. I know, it is nice to have some snacks when watching that awesome blockbuster, and that is perfectly fine. But don't eat whole meals in front of the telly.

## Growing Muscle

Eating healthy ensures you stay at a healthy weight, and get the right nutrients to stay alive. But, if you do a lot of exercise and want to
**grow muscles**, you need to **eat more**!

There are three things that are important if you want to do this:
**proteins** (dairy products), **carbohydrates** (pasta, cereal, grains) or **healthy fats** (nuts, beans, soy, oil, fish).

Proteins are the building blocks for muscle. The body wants to use them for that specific task, but if there is no muscle to grow, it is quick to store it as fat. So only eat this a lot, if you are going to exercise a lot.

Carbohydrates are important whether you exercise or not, but you might want to increase a bit on these too. They give you energy that is needed for the exercises and controlling muscle growth. However, these are even more likely than proteins to be stored as fat, so watch out.

Therefore, it is recommended you don't up your carbohydrates dosage, but draw your energy from the healthy fats.

Proteins are by far the most important. Here's a good rule of thumb:

\> Body weight (in *pounds*) x 1.5 = amount of proteins to eat (in
*grams*)

And still, make *breakfast* extremely important if you exercise daily. Drink lots of water and always eat a bit **after** your workout. Right before usually gives you stomach aches, and exercising actually puts a stop to your food system, so products eaten before a workout are not processed well.

We've discussed everything there is to know about healthy eating, but we also mentioned that only 50% of a healthy and good-looking body comes from the food. The other 50% comes from staying active, all day every day. But, it's easy to just say 'stay active', so I'll be explaining what I mean by that.

Leading an active lifestyle has numerous advantages. It ensures you don't store excess fat, that you are strong, and that you can live every day without tiring too fast. Which brings us to our first key point:

**What is being fit?** Being fit doesn't mean you have muscles popping out all over the place. It doesn't mean being able to kick a soccer ball 50 yards. It doesn't mean being able to casually ride a bicycle for two hours. While it takes practice and effort to accomplish these things, being fit is all about a combination of three things.

## The 3 Types of Exercise

There are three main aspects of your body that you can and should train. If you are training for a particular sport or goal you might want to focus on one and leave the others behind a little, but if you just want to be fit enough to feel energized throughout the whole day, you'll need to get a bit of all three.

-   **Stamina.** How long you're able to stay active. It mainly
    corresponds with your lung capacity, which grows if you use it more,
    and shrinks if you don't. But, it also has to do with being able to
    keep a low and steady heart rate, and how long your muscles can
    survive lots of stress.
-   **Power.** Refers to how strong your muscles are\-\--pure strength.
    If you are stronger, you can run faster, push harder, swing faster,
    kick faster, carry more weight, etcetera. Stronger does not only
    refer to how *large* your muscle mass is (as very skinny people can
    be extremely strong), but also how well they are trained to
    *contract*.
-   **Technique.** Is about your coordination and ability to let your
    muscles do exactly what you want. It's about reflexes,
    visual-spatial abilities, hand-eye coordination, being able to
    estimate where something will end up or how fast you have to kick
    something. Some of these are only useful in (specific) sports, but
    even pouring milk in a glass or cycling has to do with lots of
    technique.

Before you start doing serious exercises, it is very important to have
**correct posture** and **healthy eating practices**. If you don't, there's a good chance you will only hurt yourself, overstretch something or lose power instead of gaining it.

## The Required Training

I will now give you some idea about how you can train every one of these things individually. While most exercises work for all three areas, there's always one or two it targets more.

##### Stamina

The most important one. If you can't exercise for longer than a few minutes, you can't train the other two aspects of fitness. Stamina has to do with the health of your whole body, and should therefore be your basic activity for any day. If you don't have time or motivation to do anything else, at least make sure you do one of these. Stamina is not something you keep once you have it: if you stop exercising for one or two weeks, it will drop and you have to work your way up again.

Typical exercises are **walking, cycling, running, trampoline jumping, skipping (rope)**.

Exercises that require more muscle and technique, but still target stamina a lot are **dancing, swimming, climbing** and even **singing**.

These sports are usually done for a very long time, and are really about doing them until you have reached your stamina limit. When you reach that point, keep going for a few minutes to actually increase your stamina. If you stop right there, you will forever keep that limit.

There's also a group of exercises that very specifically trains stamina and your whole body (even muscles you didn't know existed), which are usually called **aerobics** or **cardio** (mostly associated with
**yoga** or **Pilates**). However, the key point of these are often to achieve *mental awareness*, so you might want to think twice before signing up for some lessons on these. **Cardio** is usually done by people who want to lose weight and become fit overall.

Here are some last tips and tricks:

-   If you think stamina exercises are boring, you should do something I
    call **whole body sports**. These are sports that require your whole
    body to work simultaneously, all the time.
    -   Examples: soccer, hockey, basketball.
-   If you can't go out and do something, there are some basic indoor
    exercises you can do.
    -   Examples: just walking around the house, jogging in place, going
        up and down the stairs
-   **Step Exercises:** take the first step of your stairs (or anything
    else you can step on), and go *up down up down* as fast as and for
    as long as you can. You can either do one leg at a time or both at
    the same time.
-   **Jumping Jacks:** what you basically do is jump between two
    positions. The first one is just standing straight, with legs nearly
    touching each other, arms straight down alongside your body. The
    second one is standing with legs widespread and arms high up in the
    air. Now jump between these two positions until you can't do it
    anymore.

##### Power

If you have a basic stamina going, you can do muscle exercises. Before you start though, read the section on growing muscles in the *eat healthy (part 2)* article. While exercising, you actually break off a bit of muscle so that it can regrow stronger later (when you are resting). Therefore, if you don't eat enough, you are achieving the exact opposite of what you want!

What should happen with these exercises is that you should stop because your muscles can't take it anymore, and not because you are exhausted. If you reach your stamina limit before you reach your muscle limit, you are either doing the exercise wrong (too fast, usually) or need to increase your stamina.

These are what I like to call the **core** exercises, which train every muscle a bit and one half of the body a lot:

-   **Push-ups:** We all know them. Go lie down with your face pointing
    towards the ground, and push yourself up with your arms. Then when
    you are up (just before locking your elbows, never do that), start
    going down again\-\--repeat. Make sure you keep your body perfectly
    straight (only touching the floor with tips of your toes and hands).
    If that is too difficult for you at the moment, there are some
    variations: keep your knees on the floor, move less with every
    push-up, put your hands closer to your body.
-   **Pull-ups:** even harder than push-ups, but that makes them even
    better. Seek some sort of bar that's just around as high as your
    arms can reach above your head. Grab it, pull yourself up, and after
    being at your highest point for a few seconds slowly let
    go\-\--repeat. This trains everything except your legs.
    -   You can grab the bar in two ways: palms facing away from you,
        and facing towards you. The first one is harder (but also
        better), the second one easier.
-   **Leg lifts:** The one exercise that focuses on your legs, abs and
    lower back, and not upper body. Lay down on your back, and simply
    lift your legs up. It's important to lift them both at the same
    time, and keep them perfectly straight. The rest of your body must
    not change position and not help your legs. It's very hard, but
    very much worth it. If it becomes too easy, add heavy objects on top
    of your feet to lift with it.

If you want to train more specifically, there's these exercises. Most people want to have amazing abs and gigantic arm muscles, and forget everything else. I think you know where I'm going: that's not the way to do it. Train your whole body, as everything is connected and needs each other to stay balanced. While a muscular upper body is something you can show off, if your legs can barely take the weight you're going to have lots of problems.

-   **Crunches:** Okay, one exercise for your abs. Lie down on your
    back, and move your upper body off the ground *only* by contracting
    your abs. Then slowly move downwards again\-\--repeat. You don't
    have to move up all the way, only a tiny bit off the ground is
    enough.
    -   There's some variations on this: you can have your legs flat on
        the ground or your knees bend, you can have hands behind your
        head or have them crossed over your upper body and touching the
        opposite shoulder.
    -   There is some word of warning here though: when done
        incorrectly, these can create a lot of **back injuries**. From
        my experience, having a correct posture all the time and doing
        whole body sports/stamina exercises already asks a lot from your
        abs, and should be enough to make them quite strong.
-   **Squats:** For your legs (and equilibrium), and a bit for
    back/shoulders/arms. Stand straight, just like with the jumping
    jacks, and then just bend your knees until your upper body is as low
    as you can hold, then slowly move up again\-\--repeat. While going
    down, extend your arms forward until they form a 90 degree angle
    with your upper body. At first it might be hard not to fall, but
    you'll quickly get over this.
-   **Weight Lifting:** It really depends with which muscle(s) you lift
    the weight, but I'm going to explain the most basic exercise you
    can do with any weight (but **dumbbells** are still preferred if you
    have the money). Take the object in your hand, and simply *slowly*
    move it up and down in front of you. This trains almost everything
    on that side of the upper body.

##### Technique

This comes into play mostly when you're doing sports. But, it is also very useful for your daily life, as good coordination and reflexes makes it easier for you to do any daily tasks fast and without mistakes. Catch things when you drop them or somebody throws something at you, walk around the house without stubbing your toe against every piece of furniture, etcetera.

Technique is trained with everything you do\-\--it's all about practice, which comes in the form of sport. Good soccer players have great kicking technique, hockey players great swinging technique. Any sportsman needs great technique to excel in their area.

Therefore, it is often said that technique is more useful than power. Training for technique should be the first thing you do with a new sport, and not power. The only problem is that it can really only be trained by practicing one or multiple sports for a certain period of time.

You can become a member of a sports community in your neighbourhood, or buy yourself a table tennis table, or practice in a large backyard or playing field nearby (if you are lucky enough to have one of those).

## What to do Now

Train all three areas! But, don't rush into it, and don't do things you know are too difficult for you right now. Injuries can take a lot of time to heal and make it impossible for you to train.

Also, you might train hard for 10 years, but if you one day just stop being active and eating healthy, you will very quickly lose your progress. The body is a living thing that is constantly using all its resources, and trying to regrow stronger. You only remain fit as long as you stay active every day. Even doing a little can change a lot.

\> I must note, though, that studies have shown that people who used to be very muscular or athletic, are able to grow and train their way back into that state much quicker and easier than people who've never been that fit before. So not *all* progress is lost.

Secondly, significant results don't come fast. Start simple and small\-\--doing only a few repetitions of an exercise, playing some slow table tennis or walking around your house for 10 minutes can be a good start. Over time, which can be a few weeks to months, you'll be able to easily do many repetitions, or run very fast for half an hour. Be patient, but be active every day.
